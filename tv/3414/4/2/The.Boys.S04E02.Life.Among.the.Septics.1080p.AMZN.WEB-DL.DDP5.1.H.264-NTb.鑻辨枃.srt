1
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,090
{\an9}? Come on ?

2
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:12,970
{\an9}? Ha, sicker than your average ?

3
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:15,010
{\an9}? Poppa twist cabbage off instinct ?

4
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:17,100
{\an9}? Don't think shit stink, pink gators ?

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,850
{\an9}? My Detroit players ?

6
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:21,060
{\an9}? Timbs for my hooligans in Brooklyn, that's right ?

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,600
{\an9}? Dead right, if the head right ?

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,100
{\an9}? Biggie there e'ry night ?

9
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,650
{\an9}? Poppa been smooth since days of Underoos...

10
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,190
Hey, yo, Reggie! Re-up.

11
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:33,530
{\an9}? Biggie, Biggie, Biggie, can't you see? ?

12
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:36,530
{\an9}? Sometimes your words just hypnotize me ?

13
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:39,030
{\an9}? And I just love your flashy ways ?

14
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:39,030
Shit.

15
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,700
{\an9}? Guess that's why they broke and you're so paid ?

16
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,420
{\an9}? Biggie, Biggie, Biggie, can't you see ?

17
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,510
I thought you were too sick to practice.

18
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:00,720
Done with all that, Coach.

19
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,100
When's the last time you had a decent meal?

20
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:06,770
Come on.

21
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,570
Mary's always happy to have you at the table.

22
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,820
Nothing you say is gonna change my mind.

23
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,110
Damn it, Reggie.

24
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,530
You're the most talented superhero I've ever seen.

25
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:21,580
Yet you're... you're throwing it all away slinging yayo for gangbangers?

26
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,290
You don't know me, Coach. You don't know nothin'.

27
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:25,540
I know you've got heart.

28
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:28,000
I know you want more than this.

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,420
You've got a choice, son.

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,710
Either outrun this life,

31
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:35,300
or you can run yourself into an early grave.

32
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,720
Now, please. It's me, Coach Brink.

33
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,470
Come back with me.

34
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,520
To the suburbs.

35
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,350
Yeah, what I want doesn't matter.

36
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,480
I'll never be free of these streets.

37
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,980
Cut! Holy fuck.

38
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,440
Holy fuck, we're not gonna beat that.

39
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,610
That was fucking perfect. We're going again.

40
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:01,580
Ferrell fucking Streep. There are tears.

41
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,120
Literal tears.

42
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,960
Who's happy they spent two weekends at the Compton Youth Center now, huh?

43
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,250
I'm not giving off too much of a Blind Side vibe, am I?

44
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:13,710
As if that's a bad thing? Are you-- Wait, what is that smell?

45
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:17,220
- Will everyone stop? - What is that smell?!

46
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,300
Is it... 

47
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,010
- Is that you? - I had falafel for lunch.

48
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:22,850
What?

49
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,310
I smell an Oscar nomination.

50
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,640
Shut up, man.

51
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,400
No, I won't. Don't jinx it.

52
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,900
You can't jinx gold. Look at me.

53
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,980
You better make some shelf space, De Niro. Do you hear me?

54
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,860
All right, let's get you back to one, huh?

55
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,700
- I'm gonna watch playbacks, okay? - Absolutely.

56
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,950
Yeah, let's get him some cans, please? Thank you.

57
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:43,030
One more quick thing. Let's sidebar here a little bit.

58
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:46,290
It feels like you're having a little bit of trouble getting out of the starters' block.

59
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,000
Maybe it's the scene.

60
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,620
Baby, this scene sings. All right, look at me.

61
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:54,210
In the arc of your character, this is your low point, right?

62
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:57,510
Everybody's given up on you, you're all alone, until the coach--

63
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,590
Swoops in and saves me from the ghetto?

64
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:03,220
No, no, no, you actually save each other. It's a very balanced narrative.

65
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,180
All the sensitivity readers that we hired, they all agreed.

66
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,180
My brother was the only coach I ever had.

67
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,100
Right.

68
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,610
He was a waiter at Buster Beaver, not a fucking crack dealer.

69
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,730
And he must be so proud of you right now.

70
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:18,400
Let's get this train back on the tracks.

71
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,160
- Just give me a minute. - Yeah, sure.

72
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,950
Wait, wait, you know what? One more tiny little thing.

73
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:29,120
You said what I want "doesn't matter."

74
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,710
But as scripted, it's actually what I want "don't matter," okay?

75
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:35,460
All right, good stuff.

76
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,630
All right, everybody, let's get back to one!

77
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,210
I want to make this fucking day!

78
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,180
Hey, can we talk?

79
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,600
You don't talk. It's like your one thing.

80
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,640
Look, playing Noir has been a meaningful challenge,

81
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,310
but yesterday was wack as fuck.

82
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,810
I've never actually murdered anyone before.

83
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:54,980
Does Homelander make us kill people, like, a lot?

84
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,190
And when he does, do we just... do it?

85
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,780
Look, don't get me wrong, I am stoked to be here

86
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,450
and I am down to ride the wave. I'm just having trouble

87
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:06,370
with Noir's motivation, you feel me?

88
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,240
His motivation is being a braindead maniac.

89
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,040
Just keep your mouth shut

90
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,830
and do as you're fucking told.

91
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:19,170
Violence in our blood-splattered streets against decent, hardworking Americans.

92
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:22,260
Folks, if you're thinking of letting your children

93
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,890
play carefree outside and without supervision, think again.

94
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:28,390
I mean, these two animals, Benny Long and Ian Rashford,

95
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:32,020
savagely beat three good men to death outside the courthouse yesterday.

96
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,600
The Starlighters have shown their true colors, folks,

97
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,190
rioting at multiple quote-unquote "peaceful demonstrations"

98
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,980
across the country.

99
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:43,570
I, for one, do not take our liberties in this great country for granted.

100
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:46,120
But apparently the Starlighters feel differently.

101
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,080
Let's see. Soy for pH,

102
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,960
hyaluronic acid for deep moisturizing and arginine for circulation.

103
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,160
What is all that?

104
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,080
Um, I'm a Voughtality consultant.

105
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,420
5K away from the red, white and blue Caddy.

106
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:03,050
- I thought it might be helpful. - You... You work for Vought?

107
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:05,090
Voughtality. "For a Super You."

108
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:07,340
You know Vought killed my girlfriend, right?

109
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,510
I'm literally fighting them right now.

110
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,230
I think I have rosemary oil,

111
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,940
it's really good for the joints.

112
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,310
Can you just-- Can you stop please? Just for--

113
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:22,780
- Please stop. Mom, stop. Just stop. - Okay, I'm sor--

114
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,650
Okay, sorry, sorry. Just, um...

115
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,410
I'm sorry.

116
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,330
You look good.

117
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,910
Got tall.

118
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:35,210
Yeah, that adds up, since the last time you saw me

119
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,750
- I was six fucking years old! - Please don't yell at me.

120
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,130
- What are you doing here? - The hospital called.

121
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:43,510
Yeah, when they couldn't reach me. And I'm here now, so...

122
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:46,630
He doesn't need you. Neither of us do.

123
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,050
Your dad didn't tell you.

124
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,220
Shit.

125
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,850
About what?

126
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:57,520
He gave me power of attorney, including medical decisions.

127
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,560
And he signed a DNR.

128
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,730
H-He didn't update his will?

129
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:03,230
He did.

130
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,280
Why the fuck would he give you power of attorney over me?

131
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,700
Well, I mean, we've been talking, the last year or two, 

132
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:13,160
now and then.

133
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,540
Besides that, you'd have to ask him.

134
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,750
But Hughie, don't worry,

135
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,670
- I am really good in a crisis. - Don't.

136
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:22,290
And I-I-I can handle this.

137
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,090
I promise.

138
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:28,260
You promise.

139
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,350
Hughie... Wait.

140
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,200
You leave the money on the dresser?

141
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,950
I didn't want to wake you up.

142
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,580
Hey.

143
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,460
Yeah, maybe you should stay in bed today, no?

144
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,460
Yeah...

145
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:09,930
Could've been a lot worse.

146
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:13,390
I mean, it would've been a lot worse if you weren't there.

147
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,480
Thank you.

148
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:30,950
Work.

149
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,710
Your speech therapist Gloria

150
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:46,210
has filled me in on the work you've been doing.

151
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:47,460
How's that been going?

153
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,350
You know, psychological mutism

154
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:04,310
is often a symptom of trauma in one's past.

155
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,770
What do you think about that?

157
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:14,360
I couldn't agree more. But sometimes 

158
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,830
you have to confront your past in order to be free of it.

159
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,750
Okay. Why don't we start with something simple?

160
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:23,830
Tell me about your parents.

161
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:35,010
Jesus. You're just telling us now?

162
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:37,800
Have you seen any specialists, have you, um...

163
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,430
- So how long you got? - It's none of your fucking business.

164
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,730
What's going on?

165
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,650
 I'm not sure why I'm telling you at all.  Let's just say I got an angel on my shoulder.

166
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,190
And she's a right bloody nag.

167
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,900
Butcher, I tried to warn you that that shit was poison.

168
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,400
You ain't one of us.

169
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,570
- Hey! - All right!

170
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,450
A word.

171
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,380
- You're done. - What? 

172
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,340
Fired. Grab your shit and get the fuck out.

173
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,680
I level with you lot and this is the thanks I get.

174
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,550
Fuck me. See what being honest gets you? 

175
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:20,350
Honest? Motherfucker, you've been lying to us for the last six months.

176
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:22,100
Not telling ain't lying.

177
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,940
Look, you need all the help you can get, mate.

178
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,190
Not from you. You're a liability, Butcher.

179
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:29,860
I ain't gonna let this stand, then.

180
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,820
The Boys is mine.

181
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,030
Says a dying man with one last bluff.

182
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:38,990
Now grab your shit and get the fuck out.

183
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,200
Or I'll throw you out.

184
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:47,000
- Just... - I don't want to hear it. He's out.

185
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,340
You can join him if you don't like it.

188
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:01,390
Small-town kid grows up on a Montana ranch with his mom.

189
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:05,060
On the surface, he's an everyday all-American boy.

190
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,730
But deep in his heart, he knows he's different, special.

191
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:09,520
He's always asking himself, "Who am I?"

192
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,690
Then one day that question is answered

193
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:14,900
when Homelander flies down from the sky

194
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,150
- and says with tears in his eyes-- - No tears.

195
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:22,490
and says, proudly, "Son, it's time for you to take your place by my side."

196
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:25,580
And for Ryan it feels surprising, yet inevitable.

197
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:28,370
He always knew he was destined for greatness.

198
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:30,580
Because he came from greatness.

199
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,630
Oh, buddy, can you believe that?

201
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:37,590
W-What do you think?

202
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,140
It's cool, 

203
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,140
I guess.

204
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:44,390
You guess?

205
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:49,140
- I think it looks amazing. - Oh, so amazing. 

206
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,770
- Really marketable. - So marketable.

207
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:51,900
The whole pitch blows.

208
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,820
It... does not blow.

209
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,780
It blows, harder than Nancy Reagan on the MGM backlot.

210
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,780
I'm sorry, why are you here?

211
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:03,280
Vought got rid of most of the sidekicks after Gunpowder.

212
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,990
The settlements exceeded profitability.

213
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:09,040
Yeah, but I don't think Ryan is gonna file an HR complaint against me.

214
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:11,540
A what?

215
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:15,460
Ryan is the first natural-born superhero. And his brand needs to reflect that.

216
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:18,170
He's not one of Vought's lab rat freaks.

217
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:20,180
He was chosen-- by fate, God, whatever--

218
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:23,100
to be the one who saves the world.

219
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,300
Yes.

220
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:29,430
But let's not forget why he is special. Shall we?

221
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:30,890
He's my son.

222
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,810
Chosen by God, sure, 

223
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:35,730
but, uh... made by me.

224
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:39,610
The chosen one narrative only works if he stands alone.

225
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:42,910
Harry Potter. Neo. Luke Skywalker.

226
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:46,370
Hollywood's trained people to fall in love with white boy lone saviors.

227
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:49,750
So, America will want to fall in love with Ryan.

229
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,750
What is this?

230
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:57,300
Uh, it's a crime itinerary. Your first save. Congratulations, son.

231
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,170
I'm not on the call sheet.

232
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:02,840
You wanted a kingdom for your son.

233
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,510
I'm helping you get it.

234
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,650
Excellent. Just as we discussed.

235
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,020
Feel free to move forward.

236
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,280
Thanks.

237
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:20,990
Ah, if you don't mind?

238
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:26,580
I'm here because Homelander wants me here.

239
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,080
Because he trusts me.

240
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:01,900
Listen. I know you're the smartest woman on earth--

241
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,740
Smartest person.

242
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,870
Let me give you some advice.

243
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,870
You know, girls supporting girls.

244
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,330
You cannot talk to Homelander like that.

245
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:13,540
I'm telling him the truth.

246
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:16,250
You're so afraid of him, you've plucked yourself bald.

247
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,420
If I were you, I'd make myself useful.

248
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:21,960
You know, get some lactation going, let him suck on those titties.

249
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,130
Before you end up like Madelyn Stillwell.

250
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,720
Oh, Ashley, hey, what's up?

251
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,810
Just the girl boss I wanted to see.

252
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,560
I've been looking everywhere for you.

253
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:37,350
Hey, so I heard that Ryan's doing his first solo save.

254
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,810
I want to talk to you about something. I have this idea.

255
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:42,860
Okay, so, what if...

256
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,900
and just hear me out on this,

257
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,700
what if I was there?

258
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:52,370
That's it. That's the pitch.

259
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,120
Hmm. You want to join a family-friendly PG save?

260
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:01,380
While PETA still has you on their bestiality watchlist?

261
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:04,840
I swear to God.

262
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:10,010
Stupid people who think they're smart make me want to eat my own shit.

263
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,180
Why do you let her talk to you like that?

264
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,560
She's just a bitch.

265
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,600
It's probably that time of the month.

266
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,190
It's like a full moon thing, isn't it?

267
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:22,400
You're a genetically superior being,

268
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,240
and she's the evolutionary equivalent of a capybara.

269
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,660
- Cappuccino...? - It's a giant rodent from South America.

270
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,830
You're better than her. Act like it.

271
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,660
And you should be at the save.

272
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,540
It's a good idea.

273
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,380
Thank you.

274
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:45,590
1:16, Todd and the other Hometeamers are seen going into Planet Vought.

275
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:48,630
And not seen again until... 2:09, 

276
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:51,340
when their dead bodies magically appear at the rally.

277
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,810
Now, how do you think they got there without anybody seeing?

278
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,680
A-Train. It had to be A-Train.

279
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,020
You promise? Like you promised Dad for better or worse?

280
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,140
We boring you, Hughie?

281
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,350
Sorry. Sorry. I'm, um... 

282
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:02,400
I'm here.

283
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,820
But the Hometeamers died of blunt force trauma.

284
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,030
Nothing said anything about super strength.

285
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:09,490
Because they're getting a lot better at covering their ass,

286
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:11,450
probably because of her.

287
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:14,660
Sister Sage. 32 years old, from Detroit, Michigan.

288
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:18,830
She cut ties with Vought a while back, when they kicked her off of Teenage Kix.

289
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:21,460
- What are her powers? - Smartest person on the planet.

290
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,210
I've already tapped Sage's cell phones.

291
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,000
She made a reservation at the Vought Garden

292
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,010
Suites & Courtyard Express in Harrisburg tonight.

293
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,260
Who's down for a little road trip?

294
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,720
You know what? I'm gonna stay here.

295
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,510
If A-Train framed those two Starlighters, I'm gonna take a run at him.

296
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:37,140
I-I'm gonna go with you.

297
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:40,480
- I got to stay close to my dad. - Understood. 

298
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,520
All right. You two are with me.

299
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:48,740
Aw, look, she made a cute little... penis and balls.

300
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:54,620
Hurry up, get the money.

301
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:03,710
- Lights out, you fucking muff taco. - Get back!

302
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,460
Noir.

303
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,210
- Back off. - Hey, whoa, be cool, man.

304
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:11,170
Noir, what are we supposed to do?

305
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:20,020
- Let her go. - Out of my way, kid.

306
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,140
- It's gonna be okay. - Do you promise? 

307
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,230
I promise.

308
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,190
Who are you?

309
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:31,070
My name is Ryan. And I don't like bullies.

310
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,820
It's good. Pretty good.

311
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,280
It's getting better. Solid work, guys. 

312
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,080
Noir, your entrance, you're doing too much. Just walk in.

313
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,290
Okay, but would Noir just enter stage right like that?

314
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:45,290
I feel like it's more in character if I come in through the skylight.

315
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:46,960
- You don't fucking talk. - Sorry. 

316
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,130
Still talking.

317
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:50,420
Let's just stick to the blocking for now, okay?

318
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,300
Deep, drop the "fucking muff taco,"

319
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,840
- this is for families. - Okay. 

320
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,390
Ryan, on the day, you're gonna throw me for real.

321
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,890
- I can take it. - Yeah.

322
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:59,510
Let's take five and we'll run it back.

323
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,430
- Great. - Okay.

324
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,310
Thank you, Koy.

325
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:05,150
- Dad? - Yeah.

326
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:07,810
Did I look dumb?

327
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:11,690
You really... You got to put your back into it.

328
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:14,570
You know, like... You really got to sell it.

329
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:16,780
You understand?

330
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:17,990
Are all saves like this?

331
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:20,990
Like, with stunt people and rehearsals and stuff?

332
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:24,250
No, no, of course some of them are real. I-I've saved a lot of people.

333
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:27,380
This is just to help you get your sea legs, all right?

334
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,500
- Okay. - Yeah.

335
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,500
Hey, Ryan. You want to rehearse the throw a few times?

336
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,130
- Great idea. Yes! - Yeah. Sure.

337
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,720
Yes. Excellent.

338
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,930
Hey, so, um, just to be clear,

339
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:40,430
we're not actually killing people on the day, am I right?

340
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:41,970
Just shut the fuck up.

341
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,570
Just be real precise with your steps, 

342
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:55,110
you understand?

343
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,950
You can't talk to me that way.

344
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,530
I didn't say anything.

345
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,450
I mean from before.

347
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:06,290
Because I am the... I'm the peak of human evolution.

348
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:08,830
And you're just, you're just a capabarnia.

349
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,380
It's a rodent from South America.

350
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,500
So you're fucking land mammals now?

351
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,260
I am the lord of the seven seas.

352
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,140
You talk to me like that again

353
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,100
and I will drown you in your fucking toilet, you stupid bitch.

354
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,640
After I've used it.

355
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,940
- Is that what you want? - No. 

356
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,310
-"Sir"! - No, sir.

357
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,520
That's right.

359
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,450
- Let her go. - Out of my way, kid.

360
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:47,540
That kid's face is made for the big screen.

361
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,580
A complexion like butter. He's practically glowing.

362
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,580
Well, thank God. 

363
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:53,090
Air-brushing the wrinkles out of The Dawn of the Seven 

364
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,840
put VFX nine mil over the budget.

365
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,630
We were neck fold to neck fold with Sex and the City 2.

367
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,210
Motherfucker.

368
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,470
Fancy some steam tray eggs?

369
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:46,140
- How the fuck did you find us? - Come off it, mate.

370
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,730
Your password's Janine2012.

371
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,560
I want you to put that shit down and get the fuck out of my operation.

372
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,230
Well, it's lucky for me that you ain't my boss no more.

373
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:59,360
And as a private and concerned citizen,

374
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,490
I'm allowed to say fuck you to any deep state cunts

375
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:04,320
that try and keep me from the truth.

376
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:14,960
Welcome to the monkey house.

390
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,880
Bunch of tinfoil-hat-wearing Nazi motherfuckers.

391
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,380
Why is the world's smartest person in a place such as this?

393
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,650
Oi. There's our girl.

394
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:26,700
Where's Kimiko?

395
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:59,650
{\an9}? You can be what you wanna be ?

396
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:03,440
{\an9}? In the land of the free ?

397
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:05,610
{\an9}? Love America, love America ?

399
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:12,040
{\an9}? Love America, love America ?

400
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,620
{\an9}? If you want it to get better ?

401
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:18,370
{\an9}? Open up your loving arms ?

403
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:23,300
{\an9}? Try to keep them safe from harm ?

404
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:27,880
{\an9}? You can say what you want to say ?

405
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,220
{\an9}? Because freedom is the only way...

406
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:31,720
Splinter. Splinter, come here.

407
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:33,930
Am I too shiny?

408
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:36,930
You're good. You look perfect.

409
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:40,690
{\an9}? Love America...

410
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,860
Best get a move on. The Flat-Earthers get the space at 4:30.

411
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:44,940
Yes. Okay.

412
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,570
H-Hey, everybody.

413
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:55,290
Um, so, our next speaker is not only a true visionary,

414
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,460
she's also my close friend.

415
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:06,300
So please join me in welcoming author, filmmaker, 

416
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,720
political activist, commentator 

417
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,010
and a leading voice of the alt-Supe movement on YouTube,

418
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:13,350
Firecracker!

419
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:20,560
Well, howdy there, Truth Seekers.

420
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,150
Hey!

421
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:23,610
Hey there! 

422
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,190
Aw, well, thank you, thank you.

423
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:30,240
Tell us some truth, Firecracker! Okay.

424
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,070
I ain't gonna sugarcoat this.

425
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:36,120
We got ourselves a national crisis.

426
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:40,870
Homelander himself said Starlight traffics kids

427
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:43,040
and her Starlighters just murdered three of our brothers

428
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,380
yesterday to cover it up.

429
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:47,710
They're killing us. Wake up.

430
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:51,220
Over the next two hours, I will prove that Starlighter works with Oprah 

431
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:56,760
and Tom Hanks to set up a Satanic home delivery service.

432
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:01,350
An order of a hot dog gets you a boy. A taco, a girl.

433
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:07,110
A combo gets you a child they forced to have trans surgery.

434
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:09,690
And a soda gets you a shot of adrenochrome.

435
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:11,610
We all know 

436
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:14,030
People actually believe this shit?

437
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:17,240
People will believe anything.

438
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:23,540
Even something as ludicrous as the moon landing.

439
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:26,500
that's because the brave whistleblower who was gonna blow

440
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:30,970
Forrest Gump's pedo ring wide open

441
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:34,180
fell off a bridge before he got the chance.

442
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:36,300
Frenchie. See what he's up to.

443
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,350
Coincidence? 

444
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,930
But do not engage.

445
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:40,220
Right.

446
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:42,060
Ah, ah, ah.

447
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,520
You're ain't leaving my sight.

448
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,980
...of all of the Tom Hanks movies,

449
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:48,820
you get 311, which is...

450
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:52,650
the police code for child porn. It's just math!

451
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:58,660
Stormchasers United is starting in 20 minutes in conference room B.

454
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,140
Hey, stop, no. Give it back.

456
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,350
Stop being a pussy.

457
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:25,560
Go get some of Colin's penis... or ass...

458
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:28,980
Or maybe both?

459
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:32,240
But go get it!

460
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:35,740
Are you drunk?

461
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:38,740
I just had a beer.

462
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:43,290
Four beers.

463
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:45,870
What is wrong with you?

464
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:47,080
Six beers.

465
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:51,460
You're holding back with Colin because of me!

466
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:55,420
What? No, it's... It's nothing to do with you.

467
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,970
Well I fucked someone.

468
00:25:57,970 --> 00:25:58,930
Really?

469
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:00,970
The barista at Jitter Bean.

470
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,770
He stuck his penis right in my vagina.

471
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:07,900
Okay.

472
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:13,610
You should stick your penis somewhere!

473
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:16,860
Mon coeur, truly, merci.

474
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:20,030
But it's not about you, I swear.

475
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:22,990
The Alex Jones look-alike contest is in...

476
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,200
Can we go back to work now?

477
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,590
Eight beers.

479
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:00,740
What's that about?

481
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:38,530
This isn't what it looks like.

482
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,740
It's okay.

484
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:47,450
Maybe your source at the Tower is fucking with you?

485
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:52,460
No, no, no, if she says A-Train shows up here every Sunday at 3:00 p.m., he will.

486
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:56,750
Yeah, you promise? Your promise is as worthless as you are.

487
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:57,710
What?

488
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,470
Sorry. Sorry, I was just, uh...

489
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,890
workshopping what I should've said to my mom.

490
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:08,390
You really don't have to be here, okay? You can go to the hospital, you should.

491
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:11,600
No. No. No, nothing to do there except, uh...

492
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:13,850
relive my childhood trauma.

493
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:16,650
Tensions are high after the murder of the Homelander Three

494
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:19,490
allegedly at the hands of two Starlight followers.

495
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:21,400
Skirmishes between the two groups have--

496
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,990
All right, enough of that shit. Uh, has Kiara woken up yet?

497
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:29,120
No, and I have about a thousand messages

498
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:32,000
asking me what the Starlighters should do.

499
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:36,130
Spit it out.

500
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,840
People look up to you.

501
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,840
No, they look up to Starlight. They look up to the suit.

502
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,340
You're the one who wore it.

503
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,760
I get why you ditched it, I do.

504
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,970
It's just, I can also see the value in it.

505
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:49,680
In superheroes?

506
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:53,100
You're defending superheroes right now? Really?

507
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:57,190
As cheesy as it sounds, people need a symbol.

508
00:28:57,190 --> 00:29:01,190
You know, someone they can rally behind, a little fucking hope.

509
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:02,450
That can be you.

510
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:04,110
I don't want to lead anybody. I don't.

511
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,160
And I cannot go back to her.

512
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:11,540
To me... she's just, 

513
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:16,460
she's a symbol of so much bad shit, and I-I can't.

514
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,210
I can't. I won't. It's just, it's...

515
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:20,960
Yeah, I mean...

516
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,090
Oh, God. He's here, he's here.

517
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:24,550
So I'm at the Tower, right?

518
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:26,890
And we get a call from Boise, Idaho.

519
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,970
There's a terrorist who's got,

520
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:31,640
like, the whole movie theater held hostage.

521
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,480
- And-- - A-Train? I love you. Can I get a selfie?

522
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,600
Yeah, of course.

523
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,770
Hang on.

524
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,570
I ran across the Rockies, took out the terrorist, disarmed the bomb.

525
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:50,530
- Then what? - What you mean, man? 

526
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:53,040
Then I got some popcorn, I watched the rest of Pacific Rim: Uprising.

527
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,830
Why don't you tell them the truth?

528
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:00,210
Nathan.

529
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:05,260
Just... just be chill, all right?

530
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:09,430
You're sneaking around with my boys, behind my back, but I need to chill?

531
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,600
- What's going on? - I don't know.

532
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,930
And don't think y'all ain't in some deep shit.

533
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:16,100
Sorry, Dad.

534
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:20,440
Come on, Dad. Uncle Reggie was just telling us about his saves.

535
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,860
You want to tell them or should I?

536
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,940
Come on, man, let's not make a big thing--

537
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:29,030
That movie theater in Idaho, that was a soundstage in the Bronx.

538
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:30,780
That terrorist, that was a stuntman.

539
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:31,990
Those mountains, 

540
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:35,080
they added those in post.

541
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,670
I know because I was there.

542
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:42,090
Is that true?

543
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,760
It's complicated, you know?

544
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:50,050
No, it's simple. Your saves were never real.

545
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:53,600
You never actually saved anyone.

546
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,640
Yet here you are, lying to your own flesh and blood.

547
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,060
I told you.

548
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:03,940
Your uncle is no hero.

549
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:07,240
And I don't want you anywhere near him.

550
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:09,490
Come on.

551
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:19,830
Nathan...

552
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,290
Nathan, I'm sorry.

553
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:27,260
Hey, hey. Wait, wait, wait. Give him a second.

554
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:45,730
Your videos got me to see that my entire family

555
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:48,190
had been brainwashed by clovergenders like Starlight.

556
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:52,110
I told them that I couldn't speak to them again until they did their own research.

557
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,490
It's been three years now.

558
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:57,040
Good for you. You keep up the fight.

559
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,040
- Can I get a selfie? - Of course.

560
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:05,420
Thank you.

561
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,500
Truth bomb.

562
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:10,720
The Sovereign Citizens meeting has moved to 6:00 p.m.

563
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,720
Do you actually believe all of this?

564
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:19,810
Or is it just bullshit smeared on top of a personal vendetta?

565
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:21,600
Ain't you a little mouthy one.

566
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,770
Appreciate the subtextual racism there,

567
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:27,270
but I'm a Supe. Sister Sage.

568
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:30,240
- I work with Homelander. - Bullshit.

569
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,620
- Is he here? Goddamn. - Of course not.

570
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:37,660
He wouldn't be caught dead with these ringworm-infested cousin fuckers.

571
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:39,910
Though there's a chance you could meet him.

572
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:41,660
First, I want to see your powers, though.

573
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:49,710
Wow, that is... lackluster.

574
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:51,720
I'm... strong too, though.

575
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,130
Look, what's important is: what are you selling?

576
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:57,510
I'm here to share the truth and nothing but.

577
00:32:57,510 --> 00:33:00,060
What are you selling?

578
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,520
Did I stutter?

579
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:05,770
Purpose.

580
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:10,400
I sell purpose.

581
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,490
These people got nothing.

582
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:16,320
Maybe they lost a job or a house or a kid to Oxy.

583
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,160
Politicians don't give a shit,

584
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:21,450
mainstream media tells them to be ashamed of their skin color,

585
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:26,080
so, well, I bring 'em together, tell them a story, give them a purpose.

586
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,290
Which would you rather believe?

587
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:32,630
That you belong to a community of warriors battling a secret evil,

588
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:34,930
or that you're a lonely, inconsequential nobody

589
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:36,720
that no one will ever remember?

590
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:41,640
Deep's Blue Sea Room. 9:00 p.m.

591
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:53,650
Sage has got no powers, right?

592
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:56,070
Besides her brains? Nope.

593
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:57,870
So, why all the sneaking around shite?

594
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:00,410
Let's just grab her, work her over and rumble what we need.

595
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:01,330
Hey.

596
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,330
This is surveillance only, okay?

597
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:07,290
All right, you sit tight and watch me do your job.

598
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,250
All right, enough.

599
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:13,380
Get your fuckin' hands off me.

600
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:16,010
- Just go home, all right? - Or what?

601
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:19,050
We have a Barney? Well, come on, then. Have a go.

602
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:20,220
Butcher, for fuck's sake.

603
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:22,470
You've been gagging for it. Ever since Soldier Boy.

604
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:26,060
Ten pounds of C4 with an inch fuse pokin' out your arse, you are.

605
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:27,980
Well, come on, then. Have at it, son.

606
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:30,900
'Cause that's the only way you feel any regret is to get it beaten into you.

607
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,820
You're a shit skipper, you are.

608
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,860
Hughie's fucked off, Kimiko's hammered.

609
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,860
We've been here for hours and still know fuck all.

610
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:39,070
You're gonna get this bloody lot killed.

611
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:41,030
You can't eat, you can't sleep,

612
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:44,160
and you ain't willing to do what it takes to run this mob

613
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,500
'cause you ain't got the bollocks, son.

614
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:49,580
Nice try, Butcher.

615
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,790
But it ain't gonna work.

616
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:54,300
Yeah, ain't that what your wife said?

617
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:07,730
All that bullshit you pulled,

618
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:10,190
and the mess you always leave behind

619
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,690
for me to clean up, you know why I kept coming back?

620
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:14,730
'Cause I thought maybe this time, it'll be a little different.

621
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,610
All the fucking shit we've been through together, man.

622
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:20,530
I thought maybe this time, maybe you and I could just...

623
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:22,490
just be fucking brothers again.

624
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:26,120
Just go home, man.

629
00:35:57,730 --> 00:35:59,070
Hey! Hey!

630
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,490
If you really cared about children...

631
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:07,490
you'd go after real traffickers...

632
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:10,210
instead of these fairy tales!

633
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:13,000
Non!

634
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:18,800
If you must inflict pain, perhaps I can endure so others don't suffer.

635
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:21,550
Hey!

636
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:23,970
Come on.

637
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,190
Took y'all long enough to get here from Trenton.

638
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:35,020
Traffic, am I right?

639
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,150
The fuck are you doing here?

640
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:39,320
The eyes? It's always the eyes.

641
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,570
Here.

642
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:44,740
What is this?

643
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,780
Security cam footage of your two Starlighters.

644
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:48,830
About a mile from the bodies at time of death.

645
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:52,410
It's hard to commit a murder when you're 20 blocks away.

646
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:53,870
Why are you giving this to us?

647
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:06,260
You could have got in my face in front of my family, but you didn't.

648
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:10,220
- Let's call it a thank-you. - Thank Hughie.

649
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,310
I would've blasted the shit out of you, and you would've deserved it.

650
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:18,900
Yeah, I agree.

652
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:31,620
Hey.

653
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:33,080
Back up.

654
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:34,620
Back off.

655
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:38,790
Noir, what the fuc-- What the heck are we supposed to do?

656
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,390
- Let her go. - Out of my way, kid.

657
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:50,810
- You're gonna be okay. - Do you promise? 

658
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,020
I promise.

659
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:58,610
Who are you?

660
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:01,020
- My name is-- - Ryan.

661
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,820
It's Homelander! - Dad?

662
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:06,200
It's okay, son. I'm here.

663
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:10,490
We're going to save America together.

664
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:18,210
Go.

665
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:22,460
Go.

666
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:25,050
Throw him hard. Throw him. Now.

667
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:28,180
Holy shit.

668
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:36,020
It's okay, everyone.

669
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:37,640
It's okay. Everything's under control.

670
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,060
You saved me.

671
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,110
Good girl.

672
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,030
Smile. 

673
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:53,450
Smile.

674
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:54,950
All right.

675
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,250
I thought we weren't killing the guy today.

676
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:59,500
I just feel like I'm not getting clear direction for this role.

680
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:55,310
She said 9:00 p.m. in the Deep Blue Sea Room, no?

681
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:56,310
I sure did.

682
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,440
Toss your guns.

683
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:10,780
Eh, your rifles are garish and vulgar.

684
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:13,240
They're American, you fuckin' surrender monkey.

685
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:16,950
Marvin, did you really think you could tail me without me knowing? 

686
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:18,330
So, what now?

687
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:22,870
These assholes are CIA. Genuine deep state moles.

688
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:26,380
They've taken out more superheroes than anyone in the world.

689
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:30,130
And Homelander would like it if you killed them.

690
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:35,510
Consider it your final audition.

691
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:36,890
Audition for what?

692
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:39,390
The sooner they're dead, the sooner you'll find out.

693
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:46,610
You're not as impressive as I heard.

694
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:54,360
Oh, I'm gonna send your ass back to China, bitch.

695
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,320
She's Japanese.

696
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:58,160
What are you doing?

697
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:02,660
Oh, pink eye. Too much salad tossing, huh?

698
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:05,880
No. No, no, no. It's allergies. It's allergies.

699
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,210
- Shut the fuck up. - Now!

700
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:39,780
Oh, hell nah.

701
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:56,340
{\an9}? Hava nagila, hava nagila ?

703
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:59,220
{\an9}? Hava nagila venismecha ?

705
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:03,270
{\an9}? Hava nagila, hava nagila ?

706
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:05,810
{\an9}? Hava nagila venismecha ?

707
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:09,560
{\an9}? Hava nera'nena ?

708
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:12,980
{\an9}? Hava nera'nena venismecha ?

709
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:16,280
{\an9}? Hava nera'nena, hava nera'nena ?

710
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,450
{\an9}? Hava nera'nena venismecha...

711
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:32,710
{\an9}? Uru achim ?

712
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:37,430
{\an9}? Hava nera'nena, hava nera'nena ?

713
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:38,890
{\an9}? Hava nera'nena...

714
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:40,550
- Damn. I'm out. - Me too.

715
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:44,560
So are they.

718
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:09,420
No!

719
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:28,730
Get away from me, pink eye!

720
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:38,740
No!

721
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:48,910
The storm has arrived.

722
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:54,880
Splinter and I are being attacked by CIA agents

723
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:58,670
after infiltrating a Zionist cabal.

724
00:43:58,670 --> 00:43:59,630
The proof...

725
00:44:00,970 --> 00:44:02,430
the proof is right here.

726
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:06,640
Now I'm calling on all--

727
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,310
Firecracker! No!

728
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:12,940
You gonna let me smack your girl like that?

729
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:15,230
No wonder she put you in the friend zone, mate.

730
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:43,930
M! Get the boys out of here!

731
00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:48,560
Fuck.

732
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:24,430
No. 

733
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:27,050
No, no, no! Not Prime! No!

734
00:45:30,810 --> 00:45:31,720
We loved you.

735
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:35,230
From your first Holocaust hoax video.

736
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:37,810
You know, you--

738
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,400
Who wants a creamy, delicious milkshake?

739
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:30,370
Oh, Ryan...

740
00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:39,540
Okay, come on.

741
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:43,380
Come on. 

742
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:45,550
It's okay.

743
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:47,430
Don't worry.

744
00:46:48,470 --> 00:46:49,720
Okay? Don't worry.

745
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:52,560
You'll get plenty of solo saves, I promise.

746
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:57,440
But I really do think that my being there is good for your numbers.

747
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:01,480
What?

748
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:03,070
Yeah. 

749
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:07,990
- No. No, no...  - Yes. Yes.

750
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:10,110
I killed Koy.

751
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:16,040
That's what you're upset about?

752
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:18,460
Koy?

753
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:25,960
Okay.

754
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:32,220
Accidents happen all the time, okay?

755
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:36,100
Humans are fragile. You can't save them all.

756
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:37,890
But isn't that our job?

757
00:47:37,890 --> 00:47:40,440
Look, Koy died doing what he loved.

758
00:47:41,270 --> 00:47:42,230
Okay?

759
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:45,610
- It'll be better next time. - No. 

760
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,150
- Yes. - No, I'm never doing that again.

761
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:51,240
Jesus Chr-- How many times do I have to tell you?

762
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:54,120
They're only human, Ryan.

763
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:56,490
Toys.

764
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:07,420
You can't go around feeling bad about what you are 'cause a few things break.

765
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:08,760
Who cares?

766
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:11,630
You are destined for so much more.

767
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:13,180
You understand? 

768
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:15,680
You're chosen, young man.

769
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:19,270
Sooner or later, you got to accept it.

771
00:48:40,910 --> 00:48:43,420
Not guilty! Not guilty! Not guilty!

772
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:55,550
Are you sure about this?

773
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:03,560
I'm gonna let a shitbag like A-Train step up, but I won't?

775
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:09,940
I got this.

776
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:11,690
We love you, Starlight!

779
00:50:14,590 --> 00:50:15,880
You look like shit.

780
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,090
Where are you?

781
00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:19,680
Plausible deniability, pumpkin.

782
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:25,270
Let's just say I'm a Contessa from Luxembourg on permanent holiday.

783
00:50:25,270 --> 00:50:28,020
Cherie... you, uh,

784
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:31,070
you remember Colin Hauser?

785
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:33,440
The judge's son?

786
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,190
I saw him at, uh...

787
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:38,030
Narcotics Anonymous.

788
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:41,080
Did he recognize you?

789
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:43,830
We started talking.

790
00:50:44,830 --> 00:50:48,790
He was having a hard time, so I helped him get a job at Starlight's House and--

791
00:50:48,790 --> 00:50:49,830
You're fucking him, right?

792
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:52,880
For fuck's sake, Serge,

793
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,170
what is it with you and taking in strays all the time?

794
00:50:55,170 --> 00:50:56,670
I didn't mean for it to happen.

795
00:50:56,670 --> 00:50:58,970
I was just seeing him day after day,

796
00:50:58,970 --> 00:51:00,470
one thing led to another, and--

797
00:51:00,470 --> 00:51:03,930
So what happens when he finds out you murdered his family?

798
00:51:18,910 --> 00:51:21,410
Your promise isn't worth the piece of paper it's printed on!

799
00:51:22,030 --> 00:51:24,580
I don't understand that.

800
00:51:26,830 --> 00:51:28,250
Just, earlier--

801
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:31,710
Earlier, you said that you-- you said that

802
00:51:31,710 --> 00:51:33,590
you promised to handle Dad, but you're not handling shit!

803
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:34,800
Can you just lower your voice?

804
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,510
No, no, no. You don't get to tell me what to do, 

805
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:37,970
- okay? - Okay.

806
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,390
The day you left, it was a Friday.

807
00:51:45,390 --> 00:51:46,890
You walked me to school,

808
00:51:46,890 --> 00:51:51,650
and you promised to buy us tickets to Billy Joel.

809
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:54,110
I was vibrating with excitement.

810
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:56,650
That was the last I ever saw you.

811
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:01,570
I spent a week standing by the front door,

812
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:06,410
telling Dad you'd be back, because why wouldn't you be? You promised.

813
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:12,000
But your promise didn't mean anything.

814
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:17,000
I'm so, so sorry, Hughie.

815
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:19,880
This isn't about you and me.

816
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:22,510
This is about what's best for your dad.

817
00:52:22,510 --> 00:52:24,680
You don't know what's best for him. You don't know what's best for either of us.

818
00:52:25,390 --> 00:52:27,720
From now on, you don't talk to a doctor without me,

819
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:30,520
you don't make any medical decisions without me signing off.

820
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,560
And if you don't like it,

821
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:35,060
I'll take you to court. 

822
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:36,940
I'll challenge you for power of attorney.

823
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:41,570
And get rid of all your fucking rosemary oil crap.

824
00:52:41,570 --> 00:52:43,490
Dad would hate it and it smells like shit.

827
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:51,430
Thanks.

828
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:55,020
What you did back there, you...

829
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:57,480
...you saved our asses.

830
00:54:01,070 --> 00:54:02,570
You should've left me.

831
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:14,660
To be a good skipper,

832
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:18,080
you gotta be a right asshole.

833
00:54:18,830 --> 00:54:20,500
Ain't no room for compassion.

834
00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:24,630
The right move to make was to nab that cunt Sage.

835
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:27,930
Instead, you walked the boys into a trap,

836
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:31,350
and then risked their lives to save some twat

837
00:54:31,350 --> 00:54:33,140
who's gonna be dead in six months.

838
00:54:34,890 --> 00:54:37,310
We was lucky, but next time,

839
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:40,360
someone's gonna die.

840
00:54:43,570 --> 00:54:45,030
I look back at my life,

841
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:47,910
and all I see

842
00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:50,660
are the messes I've made.

843
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:54,500
I've fucked it up.

844
00:54:56,330 --> 00:54:57,500
Every step.

845
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:02,550
And I ain't got time to fix it.

846
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:12,600
But maybe...

847
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:17,810
maybe I can do one thing right with the time I got left.

848
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:21,060
Get Ryan safe.

849
00:55:23,650 --> 00:55:25,320
I can't do that alone.

850
00:55:26,610 --> 00:55:28,360
I can't do it without you.

851
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:32,240
Please.

852
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:40,750
Too fucking little, Butcher.

853
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:44,670
Too fucking late.
