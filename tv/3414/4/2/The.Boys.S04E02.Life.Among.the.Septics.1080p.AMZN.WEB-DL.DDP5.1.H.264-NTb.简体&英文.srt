00:50:55,170 --> 00:50:56,670
�Ҳ��ǹ���Ҫ�����·�����
I didn't mean for it to happen.

795
00:50:56,670 --> 00:50:58,970

I was just seeing him day after day,

one thing led to another, and--

797
00:51:00,470 --> 00:51:03,930

So what happens when he finds out you murdered his family?

798

Your promise isn't worth the piece of paper it's printed on!

00:51:22,030 --> 00:51:24,580
��...��...�Ҳ�����
I don't understand that.

Earlier, you said that you-- you said that

you promised to handle Dad, but you're not handling shit!

Can you just lower your voice?

No, no, no. You don't get to tell me what to do,

The day you left, it was a Friday.

You walked me to school,

and you promised to buy us tickets to Billy Joel.

I was vibrating with excitement.

But your promise didn't mean anything.

I'm so, so sorry, Hughie.

You don't know what's best for him. You don't know what's best for either of us.

you don't make any medical decisions without me signing off.

And if you don't like it,

I'll take you to court.
