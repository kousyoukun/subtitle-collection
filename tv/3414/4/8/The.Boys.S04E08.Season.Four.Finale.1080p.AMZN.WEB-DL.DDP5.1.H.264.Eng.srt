1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,840
Aah!What the fuck?

2
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,140
That was so fucked up, you guys.

3
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,100
Get out. You're done.

4
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,640
There's one person you will never, ever defeat.

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,730
Good luck without me.

6
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:22,890
The answer to all our prayers.

7
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,230
A virus that kills Supes.To make the virus

8
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:27,190
strong enough to kill Homelander would evolve it

9
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:29,020
into something super lethal.

10
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:31,030
Global fucking pandemic.

11
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:34,570
I am you, which is why when I tell you you want to do this,

12
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:38,580
I am literally telling you that you fucking want to do this.

13
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:41,200
Kimiko!

14
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:44,080
Frenchie, that virus...it ain't gonna cook itself, brother.

15
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:45,430
We ain't turning Ryan into an asset.

16
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:48,340
He ain't ready.Either we figure out how to train him

17
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,960
or we figure out how to kill him.

18
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,130
Stop, stop! Just stop.

19
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:53,760
Your family isn't your enemy.

20
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,470
My mom wouldn't want any of this.And that

21
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,350
is why I got faith in the kid.

22
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:03,960
Once he's in office,we need to invoke the 25th amendment.

23
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,810
Who's handling all this?Me.

24
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,730
I fucking am.When Homelander

25
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:09,620
chucks all the Starlighters into internment camps,

26
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:11,820
you're cool with that?You didn't know about the camps.

27
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,700
You just focus on the shooter.

28
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:15,450
Make sure he's good to go on the 6th.

29
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:17,530
Are you okay?It's like a furnace in there.

30
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:22,290
Stop!Fucking Supe shapeshifters.

31
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:23,790
Got to hand it to Sage, though.

32
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:25,620
Perfect choice for the job.

33
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,300
Good morning, patriots.

34
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,260
It's January 6, and this is VNN Today.

35
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,820
Stunning news out of Vought Studios,

36
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,430
who are canceling the eagerly anticipated film

37
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:43,350
Training A-Train, though it's completely finished.

38
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:45,430
We just realized we'd make more from the write-off.

39
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,980
We go behind the scenes of a powerful new Vought PSA.

40
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,270
I take responsibility.

41
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,610
I take responsibility for racism.

42
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,370
Finally, Congress counts electoral votes today

43
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:01,660
to certify the incoming president.

44
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,080
Usually a formality, Dakota Bob's extreme anti-Supe agenda

45
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,080
has made it anything but.

46
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:11,710
We will count the certificates in an orderly fashion,

47
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,550
with no debate.

48
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,210
Is that understood?

49
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,720
Now, as I was saying,

50
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,510
after ascertaining the certificates are authentic...

51
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,490
Where's the fucking virus, Frenchie?

52
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,810
I'm close.

53
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,870
You know, once they bang that gavel,

54
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:28,850
Neuman's one goddamn head pop away from the Oval Office.

55
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,810
How close?Close-ish.

56
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,820
Fuck.

57
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:44,540
...counting the certificate of the vote of the state of Alabama?

58
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:47,830
Hearing none. The chair advises members of Congress...

59
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,830
No, I told you Vicky locked it all down.

60
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,750
Please lower your voice.

61
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:56,460
Hey.Hey.

62
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,380
Hey.

63
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,430
He-Hey. What...

64
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,390
What the hell are you wearing?

65
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:05,560
You don't like it?

66
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,810
No, I mean, I... I love it.

67
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:10,600
It's just, I-is now really the time, with the whole country

68
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,610
barreling towards 1984?

69
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:15,860
The night before my great-grandfather shipped out,

70
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,740
he put on his dress uniform,

71
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:23,570
barged into dinner at my great-grandmother's house,

72
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,040
and got down on one knee.

73
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,460
Okay.

74
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,500
Stand up. Please.

75
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,210
Hughie Campbell...

76
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,390
...will you marry me?

77
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:48,520
You need to stay right here, okay?Just don't move.

78
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,060
Okay.Do not move.

79
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,570
Hey.

80
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:04,240
Uh, I guess I'm-I'm doing this.

81
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,090
Okay, then me, too, 'cause I'm the one proposing.

82
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,490
Annie January,

83
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:11,290
I am terrified of what's gonna happen.

84
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:13,290
But I feel so...

85
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:19,550
...so lucky...that I get to face it all with you.

86
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,310
Okay, all right.

87
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:35,440
So, uh, yeah, all in all...

88
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,110
hard yes, let's get married.

89
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,870
Wow, that was... that was great.

90
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:53,830
Two fingers was a lot, but...

91
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:56,130
Sorry, I was just trying to level up.

92
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:59,500
Oh, no, it's... it's fine. It's great.

93
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,020
Where you going?

94
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,730
We need some champs to... celebrate.

95
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:23,240
And...not that Kirkland shit that's in the fridge.

96
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,820
I'll be right back.Yeah, okay. Yeah.

97
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:39,590
The certificate from Kansas, the parliamentarians advised me,

98
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:42,050
is the only certificate of vote from the state,

99
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:45,380
and has annexed to it a certificate from an authority...

100
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,130
You're 90 over 60.

101
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,680
That's low.

102
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,640
You don't fucking say?

103
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:02,400
You know, if you need any help...

104
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:07,360
I don't need your help.Really?

105
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,870
Seems to me you are shitting in a bedpan

106
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:12,330
and days away from being planted.

107
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:15,200
And what do you have to show for it?

108
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:17,710
I mean, Singer... he's as good as dead.

109
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:20,460
Homelander... he won.

110
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,960
And you... you gave away the virus.

111
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,090
The one fucking weapon that could've stopped him.

112
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:29,050
But we are gonna turn that frown

113
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:31,390
upside down, my friend.

114
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:33,560
You know why?

115
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,430
'Cause you still have me.

116
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,980
You ain't even fucking real.

117
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,700
Well, now, that's an interesting philosophical question.

118
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:43,980
See, what is real are the fucking

119
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,990
V'd up tumors that are mushrooming inside your guts and noggin.

120
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,660
Super cancer.

121
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,410
What is real is that piece of you

122
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:59,620
that wants to burn every fucking Supe on Earth.

123
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:03,750
How is it you think you ripped Ezekiel into fun-sized little chunks?

124
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,420
I'm the one that gave you the juice that you needed.

125
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,470
And I can do it again.

126
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:14,300
All you have to do is hold up your end of the bargain.

127
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:16,140
Bargain?

128
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,720
What fucking bargain?

129
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:19,430
We go all the way.

130
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,890
I mean, come on, champ,

131
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:23,770
what's a little genocide between friends?

132
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,070
Just fuck off and let me die in peace, would you?

133
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:29,400
Wish I could.

134
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,870
Since you're here...

135
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:43,460
...be a doll and fetch us a pint, would you?

136
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:47,250
Come on, don't be a cunt. I'm fucking dying here.

137
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,090
Your dying's been pretty high on my wish list lately.

138
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:54,470
I appreciate what you're doing here for me.

139
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:56,510
Not one bit of this is for you.

140
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,600
All right, then.

141
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,730
Give us me phone. We got work to do.

142
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,100
Disgusting.

143
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:50,030
God damn it, Ryan.

144
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:43,950
Come here.

145
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:47,870
Come here. That's an order.

146
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,800
I'm your father.

147
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,010
Not him.

148
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:05,850
And I always will be.

149
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:15,030
Come here.Now.

150
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:19,570
Ryan.

151
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,490
Ryan!

152
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:36,510
Hey.

153
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,060
You know,I'd be careful with those...

154
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:45,690
...those Lean Lad Diet Lunches?

155
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:49,940
They cause kidney stones the size of jawbreakers.

156
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:52,570
There's a whole class action lawsuit against them.

157
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:55,740
Come here.Don't!Don't-don't fucking touch me.

158
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,040
Hey, chill, okay?

159
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,790
I just need a little recharge.

160
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:05,340
Why the fuck would I kill your mother?

161
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,920
That requires going to Sedona,

162
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,380
and no one should have to go to Sedona.

163
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,630
Get out of my head.

164
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:17,470
Oh, this?

165
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,950
I proposed to Hughie this morning.

166
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,520
I even told him the story about your great-grandparents.

167
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,820
And then we fucked to celebrate.

168
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,900
And we did butt stuff.He was so into it.

169
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,780
Oh, Christ.

170
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,320
It's like a fucking furnace in here.

171
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:37,990
Why?Don't you just love proposals?

172
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,830
I mean, the joy on the other person's face

173
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:43,370
when they finally get their happily ever after.

174
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:46,750
You're a psychopath.Sociopath!

175
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:51,380
Which is to be expected, really. I mean,

176
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,170
barely remember what I look like.

177
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,050
I do remember the first time I shifted, though.

178
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:02,270
One minute I was me and the next I was Ms. Jamison,

179
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:04,100
my preschool teacher.

180
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:07,980
And I could see every memory she'd ever had.

181
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,900
Fucking her husband's best friend,

182
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,530
shoplifting lip gloss, hitting a student.

183
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:14,610
But you know what the funny part is?

184
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:20,080
She felt justified in doing all those shitty things.

185
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,830
You all do it.

186
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:27,880
You all think you're the heroes of your own story.

187
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,590
I mean, look at you.

188
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:35,840
You're more moral and good and honest than the rest of us

189
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:39,890
just wallowing down in the shit.

190
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:41,770
I don't think that.Yeah, you do. Come on.

191
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:43,810
Mind reader, remember?

192
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:45,640
"Wasn't my fault

193
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:48,150
that I was a total cunt at the pageants, that was Mommy.

194
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:50,900
Or that I had to suck cock

195
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:54,650
like a fucking popsicle to stay in The Seven. No.

196
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:55,860
No, no, no, no, no.

197
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:59,160
I'm Annie January and it's not my fault."

198
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,360
Come on, say it with me now.

199
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:02,240
I'm Annie January and it's not my...

200
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:04,040
Fuck you!

201
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,920
You don't know anything about me or my life.

202
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,500
No?Then why aren't your powers working?

203
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,380
I mean,you weren't even the original choice to kill Singer,

204
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:22,180
but you're just such a fucking hot mess,

205
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,470
you made it undeniable.

206
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,270
Hey.

207
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:31,860
You'll have a couple of...non-consecutive life sentences

208
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,250
to work through your identity issues.

209
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,150
Please...Aw.

210
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,900
Poor Annie.

211
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:42,740
Please."Oh, God, I'm Annie January

212
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,490
and I'm the only good one."

213
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,710
Oh. Here.

214
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:54,500
To wash down those Lean Lad Lunches.

215
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:02,220
Okay.

216
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:17,820
Oi oi.I've called you, like,15 times. I was worried. I thought...

217
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,570
I don't know, I thought maybe you were...

218
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,950
Yeah, you and me both.

219
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,510
Look, we're kind of up against it right now.

220
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,760
They're only a few hours away from certifying the election

221
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:29,370
and then, you know, after that happens they're-they're coming for Singer.

222
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,000
We need your help.

223
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:34,880
Butcher?

224
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,630
When I was a lad,

225
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,510
I heard about this place in Nevada.

226
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,180
A steakhouse.

227
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:47,430
Where the birds get their baps out when they're bringing your ribeye.

228
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:50,850
Cool.

229
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,730
Lenny nearly pissed himself when I told him.

230
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,480
Thought it was the funniest thing he ever heard.

231
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,740
We was gonna go there someday.

232
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:10,330
Well...

233
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:14,580
Funny what you think about when your time's up, innit?

234
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:18,250
Butcher, where are you?I-I can come to you.

235
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,380
You know, we can figure this out.

236
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:22,510
Do us a favor, would you, Hughie?

237
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:29,060
Go there.

238
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,850
For me and Len, would you?

239
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,150
You can't fucking give up.

240
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:37,230
You can still fight.

241
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,360
Hughie, I asked you something.

242
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:43,490
Fine. I'll-I'll, um...

243
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:45,660
I'll go to the topless steakhouse for you.

244
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:48,450
Magic.

245
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,710
And, uh...

246
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,670
...tell the Boys I'm sorry, would you?

247
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:04,050
Tell the Boys I'm sorry

248
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,510
for, uh...

249
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,930
Just tell them I'm sorry.

250
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,150
Goodbye, Hughie.

251
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:30,700
Oh, hey, um,

252
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:34,250
have Negin get me a caramel pretzel s'more frappe from Jitter Bean.

253
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:37,170
Double whip. I'm just like molasses in winter today.

254
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:40,630
Ugh, God, that's enough, Amber. Thank you.

255
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,760
Good morning.

256
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,890
How are you doing this mor...Oh, God.

257
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:51,810
Excuse me.

258
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:53,030
Can we just make this quick, please?

259
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,410
I have slightly more important things to do today.

260
00:16:54,430 --> 00:17:00,230
Yes ma'am, of course.Hey.Stand by. Going in five, four,

261
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,900
three...

262
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,630
Welcome to the show, folks.

263
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:08,070
We got a real happy surprise for y'all today.

264
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,410
Homelander and vice president-elect

265
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,490
Victoria Neuman.

266
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:16,500
Bless both your hearts for being here.

267
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:19,580
I'm more than happy to find time for my friend Homelander.

268
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:21,210
Yeah, let's cut the BS.

269
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:24,380
Dakota Bob says he's gonna pass nutbag anti-Supe laws

270
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,920
in his first hundred days.

271
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:27,480
As his VP...

272
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:36,620
...staunch ally of the super-abled community,

273
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,370
I really think that it's important to...

274
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,480
Ally, Victoria, really?

275
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,030
We're here to tell the truth.

276
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:48,200
So just... tell the truth.

277
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:55,590
The truth is that the real issue here is lack of representation.

278
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,510
And I want to make sure that you...Fine, you don't want to do it?

279
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,540
I'll do it.

280
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:03,250
Victoria here is a superhero.

281
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,050
Thanks for the compliment.

282
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:10,130
But, like, I think the truth is we all want to be heroes,

283
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,800
but, um, I'm not literally a su...

284
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:16,680
Oh, fuck.

285
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:18,890
It's all true.

286
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:22,980
Ms. Neuman here has been operating as

287
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,400
a secret dagger in the heart of the deep state,

288
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,650
standing up to the forces of darkness that want to

289
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,490
sodomize our democracy and our toddlers,

290
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:33,370
but it is time for the great awakening.

291
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:36,330
Where we go one, we go Vought, y'all.

292
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:37,470
We're gonna take a quick break...

293
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,500
Cunt's out of the bag, innit?

294
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,170
Now it gets interesting.

295
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,670
All right. Great show, guys.

296
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:49,090
Hey. Hey!

297
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,680
Ma'am...Fuck off! Hey.

298
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,720
I worked my whole life to keep that secret.

299
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:59,020
Well, secrets rot your soul.

300
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,390
You're unburdened. You should thank me.Sage said...

301
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,110
Fuck Sage. She's long gone. Listen to me.

302
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:05,480
Listen to me.

303
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:08,110
We are gonna change the world,

304
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,990
Vicky, for our kids and their kids.

305
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:14,570
The first super-abled president.

306
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:17,370
Hmm?And you're a gal.

307
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:19,620
I'll be impeached.

308
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,260
Why would we care?Because I have to

309
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:23,540
get re-elected in four years.Says who?

310
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:26,250
Article II of the Constitution.New world, new rules.

311
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,300
Now shut the fuck up and listen.

312
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,300
Our fates are connected now.

313
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:33,630
Singer's as good as dead, and I am the only fucking friend you've got left.

314
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,310
The train has left the station, gorgeous, and you're on it.

315
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:41,770
You'll have to arrest half your company. Half the country.

316
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:48,290
Wait, you think I didn't think of that?Of course I thought of that.

317
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,990
Fuck.

318
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:54,990
Ashley, on me now.Um, the response on socials has been mixed.

319
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:57,490
I need you to make a list of anyone within the company

320
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:01,040
that has damaging information on me or The Seven...

321
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,220
but mostly me...anyone with any fucking leverage whatsoever.

322
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,330
Yes.I need this fucking list yesterday.

323
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,420
Yes, sir.

324
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,790
You're a good girl.

325
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:15,300
that doesn't sound good, Ashley.Oh, yeah, no shit, Ashley.

326
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,550
Sorry, Ashley.

327
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,180
Order!

328
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:21,850
The purpose of the joint session having concluded,

329
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:26,060
pursuant to Senate Concurrent Resolution 1, 118th congress,

330
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:29,360
the chair declares the joint session resolved.

331
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,610
...certified the election despite the shocking news

332
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:36,740
that vice president-elect Victoria Neuman is super-abled.

333
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,160
Protests have erupted all over the country

334
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,920
as Starlighters...That's the ballgame.

335
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:43,450
Open season on Singer now. Frenchie, tell me you got something.

336
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,920
You want to try this instead of me?

337
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,040
I'm working as fast as I can.

338
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:49,840
Not fast enough.

339
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,800
Multiple protestors have been injured...

340
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,050
You seeing this?

341
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:56,030
Get all the dirt on Neuman ready in case we need to go nuclear.

342
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:57,530
Wait, wait, wait, wait. What happened to the virus?

343
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:59,220
There is no fucking virus.

344
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,430
What?Fuck.

345
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,390
Okay, well, you know she's gonna kill us if we leak this, right?

346
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,200
If I had another fucking choice, trust me, I'd take it.

347
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,580
All right, here goes fucking nothing.

348
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,650
Hi.

349
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,400
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Fuck!

350
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,030
What?What happened?It's all gone.

351
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:16,670
Everything we have on Neuman... the murders,

352
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,800
her ties to Stan Edgar, everything.Okay, okay, wait a second.

353
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,220
You got backups, right... another computer or the motherfucking cloud?

354
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,330
You're not hearing me. It's all gone. The originals,

355
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:24,790
the backups, we've got nothing.

356
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:28,250
Ain't nothing stopping her then.

357
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,000
Only one thing left to do.

358
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,800
Frenchie, you stay here, work fucking faster.

359
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,260
Kimiko, you're with me.

360
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,280
Listen, Hughie, I'm sending you coordinates. You and Annie,

361
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,970
meet there ASAP.What's the plan?

362
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:42,810
We fucked up our chance at offense. All we got now is defense.

363
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,060
I am as shocked as you are

364
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:50,020
by this profound betrayal of trust.

365
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,940
In America, you tell people who you are

366
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,280
before you ask for their vote.

367
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,030
That's why I'm calling for a new, free and fair election.

368
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:01,160
Mark my words,

369
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,530
if Victoria Neuman becomes vice president,

370
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:06,250
it will be over my dead body

371
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:08,210
because she had me assassinated.

372
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:12,590
Wow. Guess you got to go take a bullet for the geezer, don't you?

373
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:14,630
I think it's more important that I stay here.

374
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,880
Your visitor's here.

375
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,090
Send him in.

376
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,020
Man, this is never gonna work.

377
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,940
You got my text.

378
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,650
I'm glad you came.

379
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:38,990
You're almost taller than me now.

380
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:41,660
There's no saving the kid. He can't escape his own blood.

381
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:42,970
What are they feeding you?

382
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:44,930
And tell me there's vegetables involved somewhere.

383
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:46,620
There's lettuce on the burgers.

384
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,410
I've missed you, kiddo.

385
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,920
Listen, Ryan,

386
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,800
we, uh, need to have a bit of a serious chin wag.

387
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,420
You look... really sick.

388
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,970
Don't I know it.

389
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:06,060
Mate, I've wished myself dead more times than I can count.

390
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,190
And now here I am,

391
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:12,520
and I want some more time.

392
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,980
But I don't have it,

393
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,940
and I don't have time to ease you into this.

394
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,730
You're gonna have to kill him, Billy.

395
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,820
You can't go back to the tower.

396
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,410
You need to go with Aunt Grace.What?

397
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:27,540
Like when?Now.Right now.No, I-I can't.

398
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:30,040
My dad would find me.Not this time, kiddo.

399
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,580
Well...

400
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:35,210
I'm not sure I want to leave.

401
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:38,460
I kind of like it there. Well, parts of it.

402
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:41,070
You see?You got to stab him with the virus and you got to do it today.

403
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:43,340
Ryan, no.

404
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:45,590
Your Dad is a...Grace.

405
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:49,220
Look...

406
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:52,560
when your mom died... which weren't your fault...

407
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:55,560
...you heard what she said.

408
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:58,940
She had me promise to keep you safe, and that's all I'm trying to do here.

409
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:03,650
Now, if you're telling me,I mean, seriously telling me,

410
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:08,120
that the place you feel safest is with Homelander...

411
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,000
...then I ain't gonna stop you.

412
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,430
Do you want to play?

413
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:34,640
All right, then. Come on.

414
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:50,970
Have you seen Ryan?No, but I can send a PA

415
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:54,620
to go look, if you need.No. No. Boys need their space.

416
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:57,000
List?Oh, yeah. Um... Sorry.

417
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:04,970
...let go.

418
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:07,090
Great. Thank you. Good job.

419
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,760
You're excused.

420
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:17,140
You know, no problem. I can get it.

421
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,200
Cilantro.

422
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:34,910
Gentlemen.The Seven is a circle of trust.

423
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:41,420
What we're gonna tell you is extremely sensitive.

424
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,170
Got it?O Captain, my Captain.

425
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:49,180
Robert Singer will be dead by end of business.

426
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,800
Neuman will be sworn in.

427
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:53,220
People will panic. There will be rioting,

428
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:55,850
bloodshed, et cetera, et cetera.

429
00:25:55,930 --> 00:26:00,230
Someone will have to swoop in and restore order.

430
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,020
We will put out the call to every Vought hero,

431
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:06,650
every fucking one, to surround the Capitol,

432
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,950
the White House, and the Pentagon.

433
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:11,780
Defending the rightful President Neuman.

434
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:13,990
Now, what I need you two...

435
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,660
Fuck's sakes, get a Ricola.

436
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:22,330
Sorry, sir. I'm-I'm so sorry. I'm just... the meds, you know.

437
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:24,920
You know, the... the meds.

438
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,690
They're just, they're causing a little

439
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,840
heart palpitation and a high fever, but it ain't no big thing.

440
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:33,660
Okay, well, you're coughing all over me, and it's fucking disgusting.

441
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,680
Go further down.

442
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,220
Scoot.

443
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:52,870
Further.

444
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:05,290
As I was saying...

445
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:11,800
...everyone on this list needs to be removed.

446
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,550
Permanently, by the end of the day.

447
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,220
Hey, if we're thinking about who's got the most dirt on us,

448
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:21,810
wouldn't Ashley's name be at the top of the list?

449
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,650
Yeah. Sure. Good idea.

450
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:32,530
Does anybody know Ashley's last name?

451
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:41,660
What the...?

452
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:43,700
You seriously telling us the Shifter can get through that?

453
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:46,040
Look, for all I fucking know, they could be in here already.

454
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:49,360
So, from now on, everybody moves with a partner,

455
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,030
and you check in every five minutes on the dot.

456
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:54,400
Stay sharp and follow motherfucking orders.

457
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:56,360
Come on, let's get to it.

458
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:58,030
Sir, you're gonna be all right.

459
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,030
If you'd killed Neuman like I ordered,

460
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,240
we wouldn't be stuck four stories underground

461
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:04,540
playing pocket pool, idiot.

462
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,170
Balls.

463
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:12,000
Kimiko, stay on Singer.

464
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,800
Do you really think the Shifter is in here?

465
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:22,970
I hope not, for Christ's sake, but it could be anyone,

466
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,730
so eyes on everyone.

467
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:26,350
Okay. You got it.

468
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:31,110
Jesus.

469
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:34,990
You okay?Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

470
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:38,780
I'm just... warm.

471
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,200
It's like a furnace in here.

472
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,540
It's like a furnace in there.

473
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:52,340
Y-You should go find some water.

474
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:55,300
Yeah. Okay. Do you want one?

475
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,090
I would love one.

476
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,050
I'll be right back.Okay.

477
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:08,350
Holy fucking shit.

478
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,250
Balls.

479
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:38,550
Hey. Hey, man. Hey, just... sorry. Just something... stupid.

480
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:40,320
Real quick, just don't look at me, look right into the room.

481
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:42,800
Huh?Don't look at me, just look forward.

482
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:45,110
Don't look at me, just look forward.All right, all right, okay.

483
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:47,470
Stay cool.

484
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,600
It's Annie.What's Annie?

485
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:51,520
The Shifter, it's Annie.What?

486
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,000
She's the Shifter. Don't look at me, just look forward.

487
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,060
How do you know?

488
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:56,670
Just trust me, I don't know how or when they switched, but that is

489
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:59,320
100% percent not Annie.Okay, okay, okay, listen.

490
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,560
The fate of the country relies on us keeping our shit together, so just chill...

491
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:04,950
Hey.Hey.Hey.

492
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,080
Water?

493
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,550
Thanks.There you go.

494
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:09,200
Yeah, great.Mm-hmm.

495
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,590
What are you looking at?

496
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:23,430
Uh...I know.

497
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:29,770
Oh. Wow... you...

498
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,100
Congratulations.Thank you.

499
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:34,230
Yep. We did that.

500
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:36,360
That is a thing...

501
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,080
that we did.For the record,

502
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:41,860
I proposed. 'Cause peg the patriarchy, right?

503
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:45,120
Yeah, peg the patriarchy. You got to peg it...

504
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,580
peg it in all its holes.

505
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:49,180
Listen, getting hitched,best decision I ever made in my life,

506
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,040
so congratulations to you both.

507
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,500
But, uh, you know, Mother Nature's calling,

508
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,250
so I'm about to go hit the head, and...

509
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,440
y'all just hold down the fort...Yes, motherfucker.

510
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:00,060
Sir, get down.Sir, come with me.

511
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,800
Sir, this way.

512
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,180
Oh, shit.

513
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:20,070
Oh, goddamn it.

514
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:41,670
Go.

515
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:26,630
Come on.

516
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,900
How many fucking numbers are there?

517
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:29,800
Oh, God.

518
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:44,280
Take Singer. Go.Now.

519
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,610
Let's go.Go.

520
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,610
Hughie, go.

521
00:33:56,660 --> 00:34:00,830
You really think your broke-down ass can take me?

522
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:04,550
You couldn't even blast yourself out, could you?

523
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,280
You're right.

524
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:35,910
I don't know if I'm a hero.

525
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:40,620
I don't know who the fuck I am.

526
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:46,880
But I do know that I'm the bitch beating your ass.

527
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,540
Victoria.

528
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,290
Singer's alive. Your assassin failed.

529
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:26,710
What do you mean failed?Now the CIA's gonna find an even deeper hole to hide him in.

530
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,510
Well, there's nothing on the news.

531
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:30,760
Because he's gonna hit me back quietly, and I'm fairly

532
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,430
fucking sure he has the means to do it.

533
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:33,800
Where is Sage?

534
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:36,740
Maybe she can find a way out of this idiotic mess you've dropped us in.

535
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:40,730
We have not failed. I will end Singer myself if I have to.

536
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:45,770
You will be president, and you will go along with every word I say

537
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:49,860
as if my hand was jammed up your tight, puckered little asshole,

538
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,340
like the puppet you've always been.

539
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:56,030
And, Victoria, if you stray even an inch off that path,

540
00:35:56,120 --> 00:36:00,370
I will make sure Zoe knows nothing but pain for the rest of her life,

541
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:03,500
and I will send you a piece of her every year

542
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,540
for the fucking rest of yours.

543
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:08,250
There is no fail.

544
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:20,520
Well, guess who has two thumbs

545
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:24,270
and is the motherfucking genius of all fucking geniuses.

546
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:25,770
The virus is...

547
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,730
What happened to you guys?

548
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:00,390
Hello, hello.

549
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:03,230
Um, you okay?

550
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:04,770
I'm great.

551
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:06,810
Thank God you showed up.

552
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,360
How'd you find us, anyway?Find Your Phone.

553
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:15,610
I actually also found your fiancee.Oh...

554
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,130
Congratulations.No, she's not...

555
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,410
She wasn't my fiancee.No, you're...

556
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:22,870
You put the ring on her finger, Hughie.

557
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:26,790
Mm.I know because I pried it off her fucking dead hand!

558
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:28,730
Look, I thought I was getting engaged to you, all right?

559
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:31,800
She looked just like you, you know, right down to that freckle you have

560
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,130
down...So you did fuck her.

561
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:37,930
I...I mean, you know...How many times?

562
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:39,300
Had to be less than...

563
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,810
...20.

564
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:44,770
Oh, my fucking God.I was gone for ten days.She almost

565
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:47,250
always initiated, and, again, I cannot overstate this enough,

566
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:48,900
I thought it was you.

567
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:51,580
Yeah, and as long as you were getting laid, you didn't look too close.

568
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:53,110
That's the Annie you want.

569
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:55,070
Down to go down whenever. The perfect girl.

570
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:59,280
Not someone who is depressed or fucked-up

571
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,070
or comes with any complications.

572
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:05,170
You want to know how I knew it wasn't you?

573
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:10,830
In the apartment she wore some designer dress,

574
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,400
and you always ditch your bra for sweats as soon as you get home.

575
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:15,090
She, she found your car keys

576
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:18,680
on the first try, and you have never, ever found your car keys in under 15 minutes.

577
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,760
But the final clue:

578
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,760
in the bunker she was sweating,

579
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:27,390
and you have always been and always will be 90% pashmina.

580
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,270
I love that about you.

581
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:33,440
All your weird, amazing fucked-up-ness, that's what makes you you.

582
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:35,980
Annie, please.

583
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:40,110
I can't.

584
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,950
Fuck.

585
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,010
Vicky?

586
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:01,340
I want out.

587
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:04,180
Sorry, is-is this a joke?

588
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:06,220
No.

589
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:08,480
It's gone too far.

590
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,620
No. No, you're just saying that 'cause the assassination failed.

591
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,640
No, I'm saying it 'cause it'll never fucking end.

592
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:16,070
Homelander's unhinged, he's not even listening to Sage anymore.

593
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:18,110
If I become president, I'm just gonna be a puppet,

594
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:19,740
and if I fight back, he'll...

595
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:24,660
I'll resign without a fight.

596
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:27,180
You just need to get the CIA off my ass and get me and Zoe out.

597
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,580
Okay, fuck all the way off.

598
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,370
You're like the asshole who cried wolf.

599
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,580
I mean, the shit that you have done...Oh, what?

600
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:34,890
Like how you got Sameer to cook up some more of the virus to kill me?

601
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,500
Oh, and, yeah, cut off his fucking leg!

602
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:41,840
Glad you two connected. Okay.So the leg thing wasn't me,

603
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:43,940
and you didn't exactly leave us with a ton of options.

604
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:48,140
Look, the point is, you hit me, I hit you back,and it never fucking ends.

605
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:49,560
WarGames, Hughie.

606
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,230
The only way to win is not to play.

607
00:39:58,610 --> 00:39:59,860
I thought I wanted this.

608
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:04,570
Not for Zoe or...Edgar but for me.

609
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:08,370
You know, I just... I wanted to feel safe, and not like

610
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:10,660
that scared fucking kid at Red River.

611
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,580
But I don't feel safe, and I'm really fucking scared.

612
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:21,170
And I'm not getting Zoe killed over this.

613
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,800
This is the only way.

614
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:29,370
Vicky, I don't know how to trust you.

615
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,100
I'll tell you where Zoe is.

616
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,850
Is she okay?

617
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:37,770
Yeah, but if I get her, it'll draw too much attention.

618
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,460
And that's how you know you can trust me,

619
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:42,110
because I am trusting my daughter with you.

620
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,280
Please, Hughie.

621
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:49,990
You're literally the only person on Earth I can turn to right now.

622
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:03,300
Enough fucking running.

623
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:19,310
Sorry, bro, you're on the list.

624
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,730
Don't kill me. I can pay you.

625
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:24,380
You're a writer.You don't get paid shit.Please...

626
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,650
I-I'll do anything.

627
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:29,700
Anything?

628
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:33,870
Tell me I'm the smartest superhero in The Seven.

629
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:38,750
You are, by far, the smartest superhero in The Seven.

630
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:40,380
You're brilliant, a genius.

631
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:43,510
And that you respect me the most. Besides Homelander, of course.

632
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:45,590
Of course. Of course I respect you.

633
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:48,130
You-You're amazing.

634
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:50,760
You're just saying that 'cause you're scared, aren't you?

635
00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:52,100
No, I'm not.

636
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:54,680
I swear.Yeah, you are.

637
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:57,730
But you know what, bro?

638
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:00,360
That's good enough for me.

639
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:16,960
Yo, have you seen Ashley?

640
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,750
This is Ashley.

641
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:24,500
No, bro.The other Ashley.

642
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:27,900
This Ashley's not even on the list.Well, I don't know.

643
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,630
Everyone here's named fucking Ashley.

644
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,720
Bro.

645
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:42,810
Murder boner.

646
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,710
You've got to be kidding me.Look,

647
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:46,860
if we can flip Neuman, as powerful as she is,

648
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:49,030
with everything that she has on Vought, I mean,

649
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:50,860
if there's even a five percent chance.

650
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:53,490
Alors, what, just forget that Neuman is a monster?

651
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:55,410
I'm not saying that. I'm saying...

652
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:57,290
Look, we've all done bad shit.

653
00:42:57,370 --> 00:42:59,910
What if she's just fucked-up like the rest of us,

654
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,670
just trying to do right by her kid?

655
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:04,710
It's insane that we're even discussing this.

656
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:08,550
What's insane is that our solution to every problem is murder.

657
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:11,220
I used to freak out whenever I saw blood.

658
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:12,890
Now I barely blink at it.

659
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:17,810
It shouldn't be that way.This isn't some fucking Vought movie.

660
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:21,940
Violence isn't brave.Neither is hating my mom

661
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:25,110
or A-Train or...anyone.

662
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:29,490
But forgiveness,letting go,a little fucking mercy...

663
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:31,280
that's brave.

664
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:35,950
It's crazy.But it's brave.

665
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:40,760
It's about the last thing my dad ever taught me, and I just think...

666
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:45,710
...if we're ever gonna win against monsters,I think we need to start acting human.

667
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,180
Fuck it.

668
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:58,140
Really?Just... fuck it?

669
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:00,140
Annie, we're probably dead either way.

670
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:02,980
Might as well go out with our heads held high.

671
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:06,060
So...fuck it.Oh.

672
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:07,190
Great.

673
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:10,280
Look,taking a chance with A-Train,

674
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:12,360
that shit was crazy.

675
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:14,030
But look at how it turned out.

676
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,830
Shit.

677
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:22,250
Fuck it.

678
00:44:22,330 --> 00:44:24,790
Petit Hughie,if you're wrong...

679
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:26,250
Trust but verify.

680
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:29,840
But, Frenchie, can you get that virus into Neuman's system?

681
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,760
With a carbon metamaterial tip to a dart gun

682
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:36,430
and I aim for soft tissue...

683
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,870
...perhaps.Then do it.

684
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:42,730
'Cause if this is a trap, at least we ain't walking in blind.

685
00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:46,440
And, Hughie, if Neuman even blinks funny,

686
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:50,320
Frenchie's dropping her.Fair. Got it.

687
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,740
Look, Annie...Shut up.

688
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:59,660
You are getting tested for every single disease known to mankind.

689
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:01,290
Okay?

690
00:45:01,370 --> 00:45:03,040
I'm not getting Shifter syphilis.

691
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:12,050
Fuck yeah, Hughie. Fuck yeah.

692
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,140
You really think this is wise?

693
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:23,060
What if Hughie's right?

694
00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:29,270
What if forgiveness is the best we can do?

695
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,480
Even to Neuman?

696
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:33,690
To Neuman.

697
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:36,030
To ourselves.

698
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:41,660
Neuman is easy compared to us.

699
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,500
How?

700
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:52,000
We try a little every day, I guess.

701
00:45:59,050 --> 00:46:05,020
You know how I said you should be with Colin?

702
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:11,190
I lied.

703
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:15,900
I just thought you deserved to be with someone...

704
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:24,040
Better than me.

705
00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:27,000
Mon coeur...

706
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:31,460
...there is no one...

707
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,170
...better than you.

708
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,090
You know I can hear you.

709
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:19,670
"Marvin said there was an attempt on Singer's life.

710
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:24,430
He survived."We know.There's just some things you don't got to worry about. That's all.

711
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:26,410
They're gonna try again, and that virus

712
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:27,930
is a Hail Mary at best.

713
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:30,520
We are out of time and out of better options.

714
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,140
Ryan needs to know the truth.

715
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:35,150
And we'll get there.What truth?

716
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:40,990
The assassination attempt,it was on your father's orders.

717
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:43,280
What?

718
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,700
And Flight 37...

719
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:49,120
Homelander killed every soul on board.

720
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,200
Grace.

721
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:52,370
You're lying.We have it on video.

722
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:54,170
And he's murdered countless more.

723
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:56,100
Your father isn't who you think he is.Just stop.

724
00:47:56,130 --> 00:47:58,410
And he wasn't having an affair with your mother.Grace.

725
00:47:58,460 --> 00:47:59,550
He raped her.

726
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:12,390
I'm sorry, son.

727
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,730
And?

728
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:19,860
Your heart's pounding.There's something you're not telling me.

729
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:21,860
And you're the only one who can stop him.

730
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:24,030
S-Stop him?

731
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:26,030
Like, kill him?

732
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:27,530
No. No, I can't.

733
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:28,910
Don't ask me to.

734
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:30,200
Ryan, you're strong.

735
00:48:30,290 --> 00:48:31,910
He's stronger.We'll train you.

736
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,100
Get you ready.So this is why you want me to go with you?

737
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:36,790
So you can teach me how to kill my dad?

738
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,880
I have to go.No, just stay.

739
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:42,050
We'll talk it out together.I don't want to talk.

740
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:43,840
I'll be back, I just need to think.

741
00:48:43,930 --> 00:48:46,110
Listen, Ryan, there ain't gonna be another time for you and me.

742
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:49,350
All right?Let's just take a breather. Yeah?You can't leave.

743
00:48:54,770 --> 00:48:56,690
Wait.

744
00:48:56,770 --> 00:48:58,900
These walls are six feet thick.

745
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:00,900
This is the CIA's Hazlet safe house.

746
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:02,530
Designed to hold people like you.

747
00:49:02,610 --> 00:49:05,240
I could seal us in here, flood the room with halothane.

748
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:07,450
And we all take a nice, long nap.

749
00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:10,030
But I don't want to do that, kiddo.You planned this.

750
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:12,370
All along. You, you brought me here to trap me.

751
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:14,290
No, no. We brought you here to help you.

752
00:49:14,370 --> 00:49:16,870
You're locking me in a cage unless I agree to be your weapon.

753
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,630
Just like they did to my dad.That ain't the way it is, honest.

754
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:26,130
Let me go.Ryan.When I lost my grandkids, it left

755
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:29,300
this big empty black hole inside me.

756
00:49:29,390 --> 00:49:32,260
Then the greatest miracle came along.

757
00:49:32,350 --> 00:49:34,100
You.

758
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:39,310
I love you, kiddo.

759
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:40,940
Please.

760
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:44,110
Aunt Grace... I want to leave.

761
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:45,950
I'm sorry.Get out of my way.

762
00:49:46,030 --> 00:49:48,740
Grace.I'm sorry.

763
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:50,830
No!

764
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,100
What?

765
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:01,230
Hello, hello.

766
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:06,940
You took your braces off, since last time we saw you.

767
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:09,200
Let's not do that.Uh-huh.

768
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,160
How's this gonna work, Neuman?

769
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:12,700
Simple.

770
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:16,790
You help me get clear of Homelander,and Singer's people at the CIA.

771
00:51:17,870 --> 00:51:20,040
And I go quietly.Mm.

772
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:23,540
And you'll owe us one.A lot more than one.

773
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,550
I will owe you many.

774
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:33,180
Great. So you're gonna help us take down Vought

775
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:34,930
and Homelander.

776
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:47,360
Butcher?

777
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:50,900
No deals.

778
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:55,200
I can explain, all right?It's all good. I know

779
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,800
what this looks like, but with everything that we've been through together,

780
00:51:57,830 --> 00:52:01,710
I've never once asked you to trust me. I am asking now.

781
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:04,210
Like the way you used to trust Lenny.

782
00:52:06,630 --> 00:52:09,050
Please, Butcher.

783
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:43,580
Stop!

784
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,290
No, no, no, no.

785
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:23,950
Stop. Stop.

786
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:28,000
It's suicide.

787
00:53:30,590 --> 00:53:33,090
I'll be taking that virus now, thanks, Frenchie.

788
00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:34,590
Ain't no fucking way.

789
00:53:35,930 --> 00:53:37,510
You took V?

790
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:40,260
It will work on you, too.

791
00:53:54,530 --> 00:53:58,110
If I were you lot,I wouldn't hang about.

792
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:05,000
Oh, by the way.

793
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:11,130
You're all fucking welcome.

794
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:31,810
We are interrupting our regular reporting with a breaking news story,

795
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:34,150
that at... I'm sorry, I'm just

796
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:37,110
looking to my producers here. Is this confirmed?

797
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:40,030
They're, they're, they're telling me it has been.

798
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:43,660
The Vice President-Elect, Victoria Neuman, is dead.

799
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:45,910
Assassinated today only hours

800
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,210
after revealing to the world that she is super-abled...

801
00:54:49,290 --> 00:54:51,380
Where's Ryan?

802
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:54,250
This was all for him after all, right?

803
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:58,300
What are you doing here?Celebrating.

804
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:00,090
We won. Here.

805
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:05,220
Everything's turned to shit.Plan's dead.

806
00:55:05,310 --> 00:55:07,270
This is the plan.

807
00:55:07,350 --> 00:55:13,110
I mean, sure, a few curveballs,but, uh, we got here.

808
00:55:13,190 --> 00:55:15,110
Just had to keep a few bits to myself.

809
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:16,980
You know, the bits you'd fuck up by...

810
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:20,360
...you know, being you.

811
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:23,570
Neuman would have been a shit patsy.Stubborn, too many ideas.

812
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:25,700
So I went another way.

813
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:28,330
...Bob Singer himself ordering the assassination.

814
00:55:28,410 --> 00:55:30,910
If you'd killed Neuman like I ordered,

815
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,250
we wouldn't be stuck four stories underground playing pocket pool.

816
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:35,750
And now we go live.

817
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:40,170
Okay, that's President-Elect Robert Singer taken into custody by federal agents...

818
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:41,550
She tried to kill me first.

819
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:44,720
...in an unprecedented turn of events that is

820
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:48,680
certain to go down as one of the darkest days...

821
00:55:51,270 --> 00:55:53,400
It's for you.

822
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:59,280
Who is it?Oh, Speaker of the House Calhoun.

823
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:02,740
Once they invoke the 25th,he's next in line to be president.

824
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:05,030
He'd like to pledge his allegiance to you.

825
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:12,920
To me?

826
00:56:14,330 --> 00:56:15,420
Just like I promised.

827
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:16,750
We had a deal.

828
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:18,170
Yeah, well, I broke the deal.

829
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:19,920
I didn't.

830
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:23,630
I told you,you could trust me, boo.

831
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:25,720
I got your back.

832
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:37,980
I-I threw you out like...

833
00:56:39,110 --> 00:56:40,400
...like garbage.

834
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:43,650
Why would you do this?

835
00:56:45,950 --> 00:56:47,950
To see if I could.

836
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:52,200
Thank you.

837
00:56:52,290 --> 00:56:54,540
This was so much fun.

838
00:56:56,630 --> 00:56:59,130
Just, you know, next time,

839
00:56:59,210 --> 00:57:01,260
listen to me.

840
00:57:04,470 --> 00:57:06,010
Next time?

841
00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:08,100
Oh, hells yeah, blond ambition.

842
00:57:09,810 --> 00:57:12,140
Buckle up for phase two.

843
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:28,870
Homelander speaking.

844
00:57:28,950 --> 00:57:32,120
And that is why, as my first official act,

845
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:35,290
under Article One, Section Nine of the Constitution,

846
00:57:35,370 --> 00:57:37,880
I'm declaring martial law

847
00:57:38,130 --> 00:57:42,380
and deputizing hundreds of superheroes nationwide,

848
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:47,590
who will report directly to Homelander himself.

849
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:49,470
To keep...Thank you, Mr. President.

850
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:57,390
Victoria Neuman, she was a great American.

851
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:59,100
And a dear, dear friend.

852
00:57:59,190 --> 00:58:04,030
Murdered in cold blood by deep-state Starlighters

853
00:58:04,110 --> 00:58:06,450
embedded in our own government.

854
00:58:06,530 --> 00:58:09,490
Now that we have full legal authority,

855
00:58:09,570 --> 00:58:12,700
a veritable army of superheroes will be called upon

856
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:16,830
to rout these traitors from our government and from our streets.

857
00:58:17,870 --> 00:58:20,040
America will be safe again.

858
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:23,880
And to the Starlighters,whatever rock you're hiding under,

859
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:26,800
we're coming for you.

860
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,590
I'm coming for you.

861
00:58:30,050 --> 00:58:32,350
Because today...

862
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:36,640
...a new age of superheroes begins.

863
00:59:14,970 --> 00:59:17,310
We wake up to a new world.

864
00:59:17,390 --> 00:59:22,940
Where hope, purity and Jesus's love shine down upon us all.

865
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:27,570
Where children can sleep peacefully in their mothers' arms,

866
00:59:27,650 --> 00:59:31,990
knowing Starlight's pedo agenda has been thwarted.

867
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:40,830
Kimiko!

868
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:08,230
Where America finally sees the woke mob

869
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:11,110
for what it is: monsters who want to destroy

870
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:16,660
our heritage, traffic our children,and feminize our men.

871
01:00:18,580 --> 01:00:21,410
Where, with Homelander's guidance...

872
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:27,540
...we will all come together in unity.

873
01:00:32,590 --> 01:00:34,180
No.

874
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:36,890
No. No!

875
01:00:36,970 --> 01:00:39,720
No!

876
01:00:40,770 --> 01:00:43,190
No!

877
01:00:57,990 --> 01:01:03,250
We will make America strong again.

878
01:01:03,330 --> 01:01:05,500
Proud again.

879
01:01:10,550 --> 01:01:15,180
And most of all,we will make America super again.

880
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:47,170
How long have you known?

881
01:01:47,250 --> 01:01:49,710
Only since this morning's classified briefing.

882
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:54,760
You were my first call.

883
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:57,550
Hand to God.

884
01:02:04,270 --> 01:02:06,440
You got to be fucking kidding me.

885
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:09,900
This whole time.
