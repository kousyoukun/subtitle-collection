you're cool with that?You didn't know about the camps.

28

139
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,870
既然你来了
Since you're here...

140
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:43,460
行行好 给我点酒喝 好吗?
...be a doll and fetch us a pint, would you?

141
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:47,250
拜托 别这么刻薄 我他妈的快死了
Come on, don't be a cunt. I'm fucking dying here.

142
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,090
我巴不得你快点死呢
Your dying's been pretty high on my wish list lately.

143
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:54,470
你来看我 我很感激
I appreciate what you're doing here for me.

144
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:56,510
我并不是为你而来
Not one bit of this is for you.

145
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,600
那好吧
All right, then.

146
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,730
把手机给我 我们还有工作要做
Give us me phone. We got work to do.

147
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,100
恶心
Disgusting.

148
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:50,030
该死的 莱恩
God damn it, Ryan.

149
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:43,950
过来
Come here.

150
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:47,870
过来 这是命令
Come here. That's an order.

151
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,800
我是你的父亲
I'm your father.

152
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,010
他可不是
Not him.

153
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:05,850
我永远都是
And I always will be.

154
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:15,030
马上过来
Come here.Now.

155
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:19,570
莱恩
Ryan.

156
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,490
莱恩!
Ryan!

157
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:26,330
精瘦小伙子减肥午餐

158
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:36,510
嘿
Hey.

159
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,060
要是我就会小心些
You know,I'd be careful with those...

160
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:45,690
小心那些精瘦小伙子减肥午餐
...those Lean Lad Diet Lunches?

161
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:49,940
它们会害你长出大块的肾结石
They cause kidney stones the size of jawbreakers.

162
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:52,570
这家公司被集体诉讼了呢
There's a whole class action lawsuit against them.

163
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:55,740
过来 不 别他妈碰我
Come here.Don't!Don't-don't fucking touch me.

164
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,040
冷静点 好吗?
Hey, chill, okay?

165
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,790
我需要补充面具能量而已
I just need a little recharge.

166
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:05,340
我他妈的为什么要杀你妈呢?
Why the fuck would I kill your mother?

167
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,920
得去塞多纳才能杀了她
That requires going to Sedona,

168
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,380
塞多纳那种地方 谁都不该去
and no one should have to go to Sedona.

169
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,630
别读取我的记忆
Get out of my head.

170
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:17,470
这个?
Oh, this?

171
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,950
今天早上我向休伊求婚了
I proposed to Hughie this morning.

172
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,520
我甚至还给他讲了你曾祖父母的故事
I even told him the story about your great-grandparents.

173
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,820
然后我们就做爱庆祝
And then we fucked to celebrate.

174
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,900
我们肛交了一下下 他喜欢极了
And we did butt stuff.He was so into it.

175
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,780
天哪
Oh, Christ.

176
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,320
这里热得像个熔炉
It's like a fucking furnace in here.

177
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:37,990
为什么?求婚多棒啊
Why?Don't you just love proposals?

178
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,830
对方脸上满是喜悦
I mean, the joy on the other person's face

179
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:43,370
他们终于得到了永久的幸福快乐
when they finally get their happily ever after.

180
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:46,750
你个疯子反社会者
You're a psychopath.Sociopath!

181
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:51,380
不难预料吧
Which is to be expected, really. I mean,

182
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,170
我几乎不记得自己的样子了
barely remember what I look like.

183
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,050
但我还记得自己的第一次变形
I do remember the first time I shifted, though.

184
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:02,270
我瞬间就变成了贾米森小姐的样子
One minute I was me and the next I was Ms. Jamison,

185
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:04,100
她是我的幼儿园老师
my preschool teacher.

186
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:07,980
我可以看到她过往的每一段记忆
And I could see every memory she'd ever had.

187
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,900
跟她丈夫最好的朋友上床
Fucking her husband's best friend,

188
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,530
在商店里偷唇彩 打学生
shoplifting lip gloss, hitting a student.

189
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:14,610
但你知道有趣的是什么吗?
But you know what the funny part is?

190
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:20,080
她觉得做这些烂事都是合理的
She felt justified in doing all those shitty things.

191
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,830
你们都是这样
You all do it.

192
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:27,880
你们都认为自己做的事合情合理
You all think you're the heroes of your own story.

193
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,590
看看你
I mean, look at you.

194
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:35,840
比起我们这些肮脏下流的超人类 你更有道德
You're more moral and good and honest than the rest of us

195
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:39,890
更善良 也更诚实
just wallowing down in the shit.

196
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:41,770
我不这么认为你就是这么想的 拜托
I don't think that.Yeah, you do. Come on.

197
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:43,810
读心术 记得吗?
Mind reader, remember?

198
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:45,640
在选美比赛中
"Wasn't my fault

199
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:48,150
我是彻头彻尾的混蛋 那并不是我的错 是我妈的错
that I was a total cunt at the pageants, that was Mommy.

200
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:50,900
必须像吸吮冰棒一样给人口交
Or that I had to suck cock

201
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:54,650
才能留在超级七人队里也不是我的错
like a fucking popsicle to stay in The Seven. No.

202
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:55,860
不
No, no, no, no, no.

203
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:59,160
我是安妮詹纽艾瑞 这不是我的错
I'm Annie January and it's not my fault."

204
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,360
快点 现在就和我一起说
Come on, say it with me now.

205
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:02,240
我是安妮詹纽艾瑞 这不是我的
I'm Annie January and it's not my...

206
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:04,040
去你的
Fuck you!

207
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,920
对于我或我的生活 你一无所知
You don't know anything about me or my life.

208
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,500
是吗?那为什么你无法发动超能力呢?
No?Then why aren't your powers working?

209
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,380
最初甚至都没选你 做杀死辛格尔的替罪羊
I mean,you weren't even the original choice to kill Singer,

210
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:22,180
但你麻烦缠身 一无是处
but you're just such a fucking hot mess,

211
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,470
选你再好不过了
you made it undeniable.

212
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,270
嘿
Hey.

213
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:31,860
你会被判好几个无期徒刑
You'll have a couple of...non-consecutive life sentences

214
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,250
你可以好好解决自己的身份认同问题
to work through your identity issues.

215
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,150
求你了
Please...Aw.

216
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,900
可怜的安妮
Poor Annie.

217
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:42,740
求你了 天哪 我是安妮詹纽艾瑞
Please."Oh, God, I'm Annie January

218
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,490
我是唯一的好人
and I'm the only good one."

219
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,710
给
Oh. Here.

220
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:54,500
正好配那些精瘦小伙子午餐
To wash down those Lean Lad Lunches.

221
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:02,220
好啦
Okay.

222
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,810
休伊

223
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:17,820
我给你打了15通电话 我很担心
Oi oi.I've called you, like,15 times. I was worried. I thought...

224
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,570
我不知道 还以为你
I don't know, I thought maybe you were...

225
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,950
是的 我也以为自己死了
Yeah, you and me both.

226
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,510
现在时间有点紧
Look, we're kind of up against it right now.

227
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,760
再过几个小时 选举的验证结果就要出炉了
They're only a few hours away from certifying the election

228
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:29,370
之后 他们就会对辛格尔采取行动
and then, you know, after that happens they're-they're coming for Singer.

229
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,000
我们需要你的帮助
We need your help.

230
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:34,880
布彻尔?
Butcher?

231
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,630
年轻时
When I was a lad,

232
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,510
我听说内华达州有个地方
I heard about this place in Nevada.

233
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,180
一家牛排馆
A steakhouse.

234
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:47,430
女服务员给你上肋眼牛排时 上身一丝不挂
Where the birds get their baps out when they're bringing your ribeye.

235
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:50,850
好吧
Cool.

236
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,730
我告诉莱尼这事时 他笑得差点背过气去
Lenny nearly pissed himself when I told him.

237
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,480
觉得是他听说过的最好笑的事
Thought it was the funniest thing he ever heard.

238
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,740
我们本想找个时间去一趟
We was gonna go there someday.

239
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:10,330
说起来
Well...

240
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:14,580
将死之人想的事挺逗的 不是吗?
Funny what you think about when your time's up, innit?

241
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:18,250
布彻尔 你在哪里?我可以去找你
Butcher, where are you?I-I can come to you.

242
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,380
我们可以想出办法来
You know, we can figure this out.

243
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:22,510
休伊 帮我们个忙 好吗?
Do us a favor, would you, Hughie?

244
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:29,060
去那里
Go there.

245
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,850
替我和莱尼去 好吗?
For me and Len, would you?

246
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,150
你他妈的不能放弃
You can't fucking give up.

247
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:37,230
你仍然可以战斗
You can still fight.

248
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,360
休伊 我说出自己的请求了
Hughie, I asked you something.

249
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:43,490
好吧 我会 我会
Fine. I'll-I'll, um...

I'll go to the topless steakhouse for you.

251
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:48,450
感激不尽
Magic.

252
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,710
另外
And, uh...

253
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,670
告诉英雄克星们我很抱歉 好吗?
...tell the Boys I'm sorry, would you?

254
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:04,050
告诉英雄克星们我很抱歉
Tell the Boys I'm sorry

255
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,510
因为

256
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,930
告诉他们我很抱歉就行了
Just tell them I'm sorry.

257
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,150
再见 休伊
Goodbye, Hughie.

258
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:30,700

Yeah, let's cut the BS.

276
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:24,380
达科塔鲍勃说他会在上任
Dakota Bob says he's gonna pass nutbag anti-Supe laws

277
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,920
一百天内就通过 不合常理的《反超人类法》
in his first hundred days.

278
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:27,480
作为其副总统 您会如何阻止这种疯狂的举动?
As his VP...

279
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:36,620
作为超人类社群坚定的盟友
...staunch ally of the super-abled community,

280
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,370
我认为很重要的
I really think that it's important to...

281
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,480
盟友 维多利亚?真的吗?
Ally, Victoria, really?

282
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,030
我们来做嘉宾是要说实话
We're here to tell the truth.

283
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:48,200
所以 说实话吧
So just... tell the truth.

284
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:55,590
事实是这样的 真正的问题就是缺乏代表性
The truth is that the real issue here is lack of representation.

285
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,510
我们只是想确定 好吧 你不想说实话
And I want to make sure that you...Fine, you don't want to do it?

286
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,540
那我来说
I'll do it.

287
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:03,250
维多利亚是个超级英雄
Victoria here is a superhero.

288
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,050
谢谢你的称赞
Thanks for the compliment.

289
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:10,130
但我认为事实是 我们都想成为英雄
But, like, I think the truth is we all want to be heroes,

290
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,800
可我实际上并不是个
but, um, I'm not literally a su...

291
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:16,680
糟了
Oh, fuck.

292
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:18,890
这都是真的
It's all true.

293
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:22,980
这位纽曼女士已然
Ms. Neuman here has been operating as

294
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,400
以秘密武器的身份 进入了暗深势力集团
a secret dagger in the heart of the deep state,

295
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,650
勇敢地面对意图亵渎我国民主
standing up to the forces of darkness that want to

296
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,490
鸡奸我国幼儿的黑暗势力
sodomize our democracy and our toddlers,

297
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:33,370
但现在 伟大觉醒的时刻到了
but it is time for the great awakening.

298
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:36,330
团结一心 沃特力量 各位!
Where we go one, we go Vought, y'all.

299
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:37,470
我们稍后回来
We're gonna take a quick break...

300
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,500
秘密被说破了 不是吗?
Cunt's out of the bag, innit?

301
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,170
现在有好戏看了
Now it gets interesting.

302
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,670
节目很棒 各位
All right. Great show, guys.

303
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:49,090
嘿 嘿!
Hey. Hey!

304
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,680
滚一边去 嘿!
Ma'am...Fuck off! Hey.

305
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,720
我一辈子都在努力保守这个秘密!
I worked my whole life to keep that secret.

306
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:59,020
不过秘密会腐蚀你的灵魂
Well, secrets rot your soul.

307
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,390
你毫无负担了 该感谢我才是 智者说
You're unburdened. You should thank me.Sage said...

308
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,110
去他妈的智者 她早被炒鱿鱼了 听我说
Fuck Sage. She's long gone. Listen to me.

309
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:05,480
听我说
Listen to me.

310
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:08,110
我们要改变世界
We are gonna change the world,

311
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,990
维琪 为了我们的下一代 以及他们的下一代
Vicky, for our kids and their kids.

312
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:14,570
第一位超人类总统
The first super-abled president.

313
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:17,370
而且你是个女孩子
Hmm?And you're a gal.

314
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:19,620
我会被弹劾
I'll be impeached.

315
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,260
我们为什么要在乎?
Why would we care?Because I have to

316
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:23,540
因为四年后我必须再次当选谁说的?
get re-elected in four years.Says who?

317
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:26,250
《宪法》第二条说的新世界 新规则
Article II of the Constitution.New world, new rules.

318
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,300
现在 你他妈给我闭嘴 听话
Now shut the fuck up and listen.

319
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,300
我们的命运现在已经联系在一起了
Our fates are connected now.

320
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:33,630
辛格尔已经完蛋了 你他妈的只有我这一个朋友了
Singer's as good as dead, and I am the only fucking friend you've got left.

321
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,310
覆水难收了 美人儿 这水就是你泼出去的
The train has left the station, gorgeous, and you're on it.

322
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:41,770
你必须得逮捕你公司一半的人 这个国家一半的人
You'll have to arrest half your company. Half the country.

323
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:48,290
怎么 你以为我没想到那一点吗?我当然想到了
Wait, you think I didn't think of that?Of course I thought of that.

324
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,990
他妈的!
Fuck.

325
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:54,990
艾诗丽 跟我走 社交媒体上的反应不一
Ashley, on me now.Um, the response on socials has been mixed.

326
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:57,490
我需要你提交一份清单 列出公司内任何掌握
I need you to make a list of anyone within the company

327
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:01,040
对我或超级七人队不利信息的人
that has damaging information on me or The Seven...

328
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,220
但主要是我 任何有谈判筹码的人
but mostly me...anyone with any fucking leverage whatsoever.

329
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,330
是马上就交到我手里
Yes.I need this fucking list yesterday.

330
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,420
是 先生
Yes, sir.

331
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,790
好姑娘
You're a good girl.

332
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:15,300
听起来不太妙 艾诗丽 可不是嘛 艾诗丽
that doesn't sound good, Ashley.Oh, yeah, no shit, Ashley.

333
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,550
对不起 艾诗丽
Sorry, Ashley.

334
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,180
保持秩序!议长卡尔霍恩发言人结束会议
Order!

335
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:21,850
联席会议的计划已完成
The purpose of the joint session having concluded,

336
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:26,060
根据参议院 暨国会第一百一十八次会议 联发的第一项决议
pursuant to Senate Concurrent Resolution 1, 118th congress,

337
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:29,360
议长宣布联席会议已表决
the chair declares the joint session resolved.

338
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,610
突发新闻 辛格尔及纽曼的选举结果已被核验
...certified the election despite the shocking news

339
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:36,740
选举结果核验完毕 尽管有令人震惊的消息称 当选副总统维多利亚纽曼是超人类
that vice president-elect Victoria Neuman is super-abled.

340
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,160
全国各地均已爆发抗议活动
Protests have erupted all over the country

341
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,920
这下局面完全不同了
as Starlighters...That's the ballgame.

342
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:43,450
现在人人都有可能攻击辛格尔 法兰奇
Open season on Singer now. Frenchie, tell me you got something.

343
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,920
你最好是成功了没有
You want to try this instead of me?

344
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,040
不然你来试试 我已经尽量加快速度了!
I'm working as fast as I can.

345
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:49,840
不够快
Not fast enough.

346
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,800
多名抗议者受伤 至少十
Multiple protestors have been injured...

347
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,050
看到这条新闻了吗?
You seeing this?

348
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:56,030
准备好纽曼的污点信息 防止事态恶化
Get all the dirt on Neuman ready in case we need to go nuclear.

349
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:57,530
等等 病毒研制得怎么样了?
Wait, wait, wait, wait. What happened to the virus?

350
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:59,220
没研制出来
There is no fucking virus.

351
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,430
什么?他妈的!
What?Fuck.

352
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,390
好吧 如果我们泄露这些 她会杀了我们 对吗?
Okay, well, you know she's gonna kill us if we leak this, right?

353
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,200
相信我 如果另有选择 我不会这么做的
If I had another fucking choice, trust me, I'd take it.

354
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,580
管不了那么多了
All right, here goes fucking nothing.

355
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,650
嘿
Hi.

356
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,400
不 他妈的!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Fuck!

357
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,030
怎么了?发生了什么?都不见了
What?What happened?It's all gone.

358
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:16,670
我们掌握的关于纽曼的所有信息 谋杀
Everything we have on Neuman... the murders,

359
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,800
她与艾德加的关系 等一下
her ties to Stan Edgar, everything.Okay, okay, wait a second.

360
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,220
你有备份吗?另一台计算机 或者云端储存!
You got backups, right... another computer or the motherfucking cloud?

361
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,330
你没仔细听 信息不见了
You're not hearing me. It's all gone. The originals,

362
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:24,790
原件 备份 什么都没了!
the backups, we've got nothing.

363
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:28,250
那就没法阻止她了
Ain't nothing stopping her then.

364
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,000
只有一个办法了
Only one thing left to do.

365
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,800
法兰奇 你留在这里 再快点
Frenchie, you stay here, work fucking faster.

366
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,260
喜美子 你跟我走
Kimiko, you're with me.

367
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,280
我给你发坐标 你和安妮尽快去那里跟我会合
Listen, Hughie, I'm sending you coordinates. You and Annie,

368
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,970
计划是什么?
meet there ASAP.What's the plan?

369
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:42,810
进攻是没机会了 现在只能防守了
We fucked up our chance at offense. All we got now is defense.

370
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,060
对于这种对信任的根本性背叛
I am as shocked as you are

371
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:50,020
我跟你们一样震惊
by this profound betrayal of trust.

372
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,940
在美国 要求别人给你投票之前
In America, you tell people who you are

373
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,280
要告知他们你的真实情况
before you ask for their vote.

374
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,030
正是因为这样 我才呼吁新的自由 公正的选举
That's why I'm calling for a new, free and fair election.

375
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:01,160
记住我的话
Mark my words,

376
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,530
除非我死了 否则 维多利亚纽曼
if Victoria Neuman becomes vice president,

377
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:06,250
绝不会成为副总统
it will be over my dead body

378
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:08,210
因为她派人暗杀我
because she had me assassinated.

379
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:12,590
我猜你得去 全天候保护辛格尔了 不是吗?
Wow. Guess you got to go take a bullet for the geezer, don't you?

380
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:14,630
我认为我留在这里更为重要
I think it's more important that I stay here.

381
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,880
你等的那个访客到了
Your visitor's here.

382
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,090
让他进来
Send him in.

383
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,020
伙计 这样肯定不行的
Man, this is never gonna work.

384
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,940
你收到了我的短信
You got my text.

385
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,650
你来了 我很高兴
I'm glad you came.

386
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:38,990
现在你已经快比我高了
You're almost taller than me now.

387
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:41,660
这孩子没救了 遗传的力量大得很
There's no saving the kid. He can't escape his own blood.

388
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:42,970
他们给你吃什么?
What are they feeding you?

389
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:44,930
希望有点蔬菜
And tell me there's vegetables involved somewhere.

390
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:46,620
汉堡上有生菜
There's lettuce on the burgers.

391
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,410
我好想你 孩子
I've missed you, kiddo.

392
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,920
听着 莱恩
Listen, Ryan,

393
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,800
我们得严肃地谈谈
we, uh, need to have a bit of a serious chin wag.

394
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,420
你看上去病得很重
You look... really sick.

395
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,970
可不是嘛
Don't I know it.

396
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:06,060
我巴不得自己痛痛快快地去了
Mate, I've wished myself dead more times than I can count.

397
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,190
可我还没死
And now here I am,

398
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:12,520
我想要更多的时间
and I want some more time.

399
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,980
虽然我的时间不多了
But I don't have it,

400
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,940
我没有时间慢慢地告诉你这件事
and I don't have time to ease you into this.

401
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,730
你必须杀了他 比利
You're gonna have to kill him, Billy.

402
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,820
你不能再回沃特塔了
You can't go back to the tower.

403
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,410
你需要和格蕾丝阿姨离开 什么?
You need to go with Aunt Grace.What?

404
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:27,540
什么时候?现在 马上就走 不 不行
Like when?Now.Right now.No, I-I can't.

405
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:30,040
我爸会找到我的 这次不会的 孩子
My dad would find me.Not this time, kiddo.

406
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,580
可是
Well...

407
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:35,210
我不确定自己想离开

还有高烧 但这不是什么大事

正如我所说
As I was saying...

457
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:11,800
今天 这份清单上的每个人都需要
...everyone on this list needs to be removed.

458
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,550
永远地被清除掉
Permanently, by the end of the day.

459
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,220
如果考虑掌握我们污点信息的人
Hey, if we're thinking about who's got the most dirt on us,

460
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:21,810
艾诗丽不是应该首当其冲被清除吗?
wouldn't Ashley's name be at the top of the list?

461
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,650
当然 好主意
Yeah. Sure. Good idea.

462
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:32,530
有人知道艾诗丽姓什么吗?
Does anybody know Ashley's last name?

463
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:41,660
怎么
What the...?

464
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:32,170
公共工程部

465
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:43,700
你说变形者可以通过这扇门 不会吧
You seriously telling us the Shifter can get through that?

466
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:46,040
据我所知 他们可能已经潜入这里了
Look, for all I fucking know, they could be in here already.

467
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:49,360
所以 从现在开始 每个人都要结伴行动
So, from now on, everybody moves with a partner,

468
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,030
每五分钟准时检查一次

469
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:54,400
精神点 听从命令
Stay sharp and follow motherfucking orders.

470
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:56,360
来吧 开始吧

471
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:58,030
先生 您会没事的
Sir, you're gonna be all right.

472
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,030
如果你们按照我的命令杀了纽曼
If you'd killed Neuman like I ordered,

473
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,240
我们就不会被困在地下四层
we wouldn't be stuck four stories underground

474
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:04,540
玩袖珍高尔夫球了 白痴

477
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,800
你真的认为变形者在这里吗?
Do you really think the Shifter is in here?

478
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:22,970
我希望不会 看在上帝的份上 但变形者可以变成任何人
I hope not, for Christ's sake, but it could be anyone,

479
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,730
所以 留意所有人的举动
so eyes on everyone.

我只是 有点热
I'm just... warm.

484
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,200
这里热得像个熔炉
It's like a furnace in here.

485
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,540
里面热得像个熔炉
It's like a furnace in there.

486
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:52,340

She's the Shifter. Don't look at me, just look forward.

500
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,060
你怎么知道?
How do you know?

501
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:56,670
相信我就是了 我不知道变形是何时发生 如何发生的
Just trust me, I don't know how or when they switched, but that is

502
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:59,320
但那边的肯定不是安妮 好吧 听着
100% percent not Annie.Okay, okay, okay, listen.

503

You really think your broke-down ass can take me?

536
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:04,550
你连自己都解决不掉 不是吗?
You couldn't even blast yourself out, could you?

537
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,280
你说得对
You're right.

538
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:35,910
我不知道我是否是英雄

现在 中情局会更严密地保护他
What do you mean failed?Now the CIA's gonna find an even deeper hole to hide him in.

544
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,510
可新闻里什么都没报道
Well, there's nothing on the news.

545
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:30,760
他会悄悄地回击我
Because he's gonna hit me back quietly, and I'm fairly

546
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,430
我确信他有办法做到这一点
fucking sure he has the means to do it.

547
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:33,800
智者在哪里?
Where is Sage?

548
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:36,740
或许她能找到办法 收拾你给我们搞的这堆烂摊子
Maybe she can find a way out of this idiotic mess you've dropped us in.

549
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:40,730
我们还没有失败 如果有必要的话 我会亲自解决辛格尔
We have not failed. I will end Singer myself if I have to.

550
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:45,770
你将成为总统 然后 你要对我言听计从
You will be president, and you will go along with every word I say

551
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:49,860
就好像我手里 抓着每一条控制你的提线
as if my hand was jammed up your tight, puckered little asshole,

552
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,340
你要一直像木偶一样受我摆布
like the puppet you've always been.

553
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:56,030
维多利亚 如果你有一丝一毫的反抗举动
And, Victoria, if you stray even an inch off that path,

554
00:35:56,120 --> 00:36:00,370
我会确保佐伊余生都活得生不如死
I will make sure Zoe knows nothing but pain for the rest of her life,

555
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:03,500
你的余生里
and I will send you a piece of her every year

556
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,540
每年我都会寄给你她身体的某一部分
for the fucking rest of yours.

557
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:08,250
没有什么失败!
There is no fail.

558
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:20,520
猜猜谁是强手中的强手
Well, guess who has two thumbs

559
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:24,270
他妈的天才中的天才?
and is the motherfucking genius of all fucking geniuses.

560
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:25,770
病毒制好
The virus is...

561
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,730
你们怎么了?
What happened to you guys?

562
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:39,490
没关系

563
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:00,390
你好呀
Hello, hello.

564
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:03,230
你还好吗?
Um, you okay?

565
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:04,770
我很好
I'm great.

566
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:06,810
感谢上帝 你挺身而出
Thank God you showed up.

567
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,360
你是怎么找到我们的?手机定位应用
How'd you find us, anyway?Find Your Phone.

568
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:15,610
我也找到了你的未婚妻
I actually also found your fiancee.Oh...

569
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,130
恭喜 不 她不是
Congratulations.No, she's not...

570
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,410
她不是我的未婚妻 不 你才是
She wasn't my fiancee.No, you're...

571
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:22,870
你把戒指戴在了她的手指上 休伊
You put the ring on her finger, Hughie.

572
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:26,790
我知道 因为她死后 我把它从手指上撬了下来!
Mm.I know because I pried it off her fucking dead hand!

573
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:28,730
我以为我要跟你订婚 她的样子跟你一模一样
Look, I thought I was getting engaged to you, all right?

574
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:31,800
连那里的雀斑都丝毫不差
She looked just like you, you know, right down to that freckle you have

575
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,130
所以 你确实干了她
down...So you did fuck her.

576
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:37,930
我的意思是 你知道 多少次?
I...I mean, you know...How many times?

577
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:39,300
肯定少于
Had to be less than...

578
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,810
20次
...20.

579
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:44,770
天哪 我才离开了十天而已
Oh, my fucking God.I was gone for ten days.She almost

580
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:47,250
都是她主动的 再说一次 怎么夸大这一点都不过分
always initiated, and, again, I cannot overstate this enough,

581
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:48,900
我以为是你来着
I thought it was you.

582
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:51,580
只要有人跟你上床 你才不会仔细看呢
Yeah, and as long as you were getting laid, you didn't look too close.

583
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:53,110
你想要的是那样的安妮
That's the Annie you want.

584
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:55,070
什么时候都肯给你口交 完美的女孩
Down to go down whenever. The perfect girl.

585
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:59,280
不是一个抑郁的人 没有历经磨难
Not someone who is depressed or fucked-up

586
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,070
也没有伴有任何并发症
or comes with any complications.

587
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:05,170
你想知道我怎么知道那不是你吗?
You want to know how I knew it wasn't you?

588
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:10,830
在公寓里 她穿着设计师款的礼服
In the apartment she wore some designer dress,

589
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,400
而你一到家就会脱下胸罩 换上运动衫
and you always ditch your bra for sweats as soon as you get home.

590
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:15,090
她一下子就找到了你的车钥匙
She, she found your car keys

591
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:18,680
而你每次找车钥匙都得找15分钟以上
on the first try, and you have never, ever found your car keys in under 15 minutes.

592
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,760
但终极线索是什么呢?
But the final clue:

593
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,760
在地堡里 她满头大汗
in the bunker she was sweating,

594
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:27,390
而你总得裹着羊绒披肩
and you have always been and always will be 90% pashmina.

595
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,270
我爱你这一点
I love that about you.

596
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:33,440
你所有奇怪的 令人惊奇的反常行为 它们是你的独特之处
All your weird, amazing fucked-up-ness, that's what makes you you.

597
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:35,980
安妮 求你了
Annie, please.

598
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:40,110
不
I can't.

599
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,950
他妈的
Fuck.

600
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,010
维琪?
Vicky?

601
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:01,340
我不想继续下去了
I want out.

602
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:04,180
抱歉 这是 这是开玩笑吗?
Sorry, is-is this a joke?

603
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:06,220
不是
No.

604
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:08,480
太过火了
It's gone too far.

605
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,620
你这么说是因为刺杀失败了
No. No, you're just saying that 'cause the assassination failed.

606
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,640
不 我这么说是因为它永远不会结束
No, I'm saying it 'cause it'll never fucking end.

607
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:16,070
祖国人完全失控了 甚至连智者的话也不听了
Homelander's unhinged, he's not even listening to Sage anymore.

608
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:18,110
如果当上总统 我就会成为傀儡
If I become president, I'm just gonna be a puppet,

609
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:19,740
如果我反抗 他就会
and if I fight back, he'll...

610
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:24,660
我会自愿辞职
I'll resign without a fight.

611
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:27,180
你需要让中情局 停止对我的调查 帮我和佐伊离开
You just need to get the CIA off my ass and get me and Zoe out.

612
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,580
好吧 滚蛋吧
Okay, fuck all the way off.

613
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,370
你就像那个喊狼来了的混蛋
You're like the asshole who cried wolf.

614
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,580
你做过那么多令人不齿的事
I mean, the shit that you have done...Oh, what?

615
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:34,890
像你们逼萨米尔造出更多病毒 杀死我那样令人不齿吗?
Like how you got Sameer to cook up some more of the virus to kill me?

616
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,500
还他妈的砍掉他的腿?
Oh, and, yeah, cut off his fucking leg!

617
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:41,840
很高兴你们两个联系上了 腿不是我砍的
Glad you two connected. Okay.So the leg thing wasn't me,

618
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:43,940
你并没有留给我们什么选择的空间
and you didn't exactly leave us with a ton of options.

619
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:48,140
听着 重点是 你攻击我 我还击 这种循环永远不会结束
Look, the point is, you hit me, I hit you back,and it never fucking ends.

620
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:49,560
战争游戏 休伊
WarGames, Hughie.

621
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,230
唯一的获胜方法就是不玩
The only way to win is not to play.

622
00:39:58,610 --> 00:39:59,860
我以为我想要从政
I thought I wanted this.

623
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:04,570
不是为了佐伊 也不是为了艾德加 而是为了我
Not for Zoe or...Edgar but for me.

624
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:08,370
你知道 我只是 我想要安全感
You know, I just... I wanted to feel safe, and not like

625
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:10,660
不再做红河集体之家里 那个被吓破胆的孩子
that scared fucking kid at Red River.

626
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,580
但我没有安全感 我真的很害怕
But I don't feel safe, and I'm really fucking scared.

627
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:21,170
我不要因此把佐伊害死
And I'm not getting Zoe killed over this.

628
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,800
这是唯一的办法
This is the only way.

629
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:29,370
维琪 我不知道该不该相信你
Vicky, I don't know how to trust you.

630
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,100
我会告诉你佐伊在哪里
I'll tell you where Zoe is.

631
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,850
她还好吗?
Is she okay?

632
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:37,770
是的 但如果我去接她 就会引起太多的关注
Yeah, but if I get her, it'll draw too much attention.

633
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,460
这样 你就知道自己可以信任我了
And that's how you know you can trust me,

634
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:42,110
因为我放心地把女儿托付给你
because I am trusting my daughter with you.

635
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,280
拜托 休伊
Please, Hughie.

636
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:49,990
你现在是全世界我唯一可以求助的人
You're literally the only person on Earth I can turn to right now.

637
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:03,300
别他妈的跑了
Enough fucking running.

638
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:19,310
对不起 兄弟 你在名单上
Sorry, bro, you're on the list.

639
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,730
别杀我 我可以付钱给你
Don't kill me. I can pay you.

640
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:24,380
你是个写剧本的 你拿不到任何报酬 拜托
You're a writer.You don't get paid shit.Please...

641
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,650
要我做什么都行
I-I'll do anything.

642
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:29,700
什么都行?
Anything?

643
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:33,870
告诉我 我是超级七人队里 最聪明的超级英雄
Tell me I'm the smartest superhero in The Seven.

644
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:38,750
到目前为止 你是超级七人队里最聪明的超级英雄
You are, by far, the smartest superhero in The Seven.

645
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:40,380
你很聪明 是个天才
You're brilliant, a genius.

646
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:43,510
说你最尊重我 当然 除了祖国人之外
And that you respect me the most. Besides Homelander, of course.

647
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:45,590
当然 我当然尊重你
Of course. Of course I respect you.

648
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:48,130
你 你超凡脱俗
You-You're amazing.

649
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:50,760
你这么说只是因为害怕
You're just saying that 'cause you're scared, aren't you?

650
00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:52,100
不 不是的
No, I'm not.

651
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:54,680
我发誓你就是
I swear.Yeah, you are.

652
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:57,730
但你知道吗 兄弟?
But you know what, bro?

653
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:00,360
对我来说 这已经足够了
That's good enough for me.

654
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:16,960
你看到艾诗丽了吗?
Yo, have you seen Ashley?

655
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,750
这就是艾诗丽
This is Ashley.

656
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:24,500
不 兄弟 另一个艾诗丽
No, bro.The other Ashley.

657
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:27,900
这个艾诗丽甚至都不在名单上
This Ashley's not even on the list.Well, I don't know.

658
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,630
那我就不知道了 这里的每个人都他妈的叫艾诗丽
Everyone here's named fucking Ashley.

659
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,720
兄弟
Bro.

660
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:42,810
杀戮勃起
Murder boner.

661
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,710
你一定是在开玩笑吧
You've got to be kidding me.Look,

662
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:46,860
如果我们能策反纽曼 以她的强大超能力
if we can flip Neuman, as powerful as she is,

663
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:49,030
还有她掌握的沃特污点信息
with everything that she has on Vought, I mean,

664
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:50,860
哪怕只有百分之五的机会
if there's even a five percent chance.

665
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:53,490
怎么 轻描淡写地忘记 纽曼是个怪物?
Alors, what, just forget that Neuman is a monster?

666
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:55,410
我没那么说 我是说
I'm not saying that. I'm saying...

667
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:57,290
我们都干过坏事
Look, we've all done bad shit.

668
00:42:57,370 --> 00:42:59,910
如果她也像我们一样 历尽磨难 饱受痛苦
What if she's just fucked-up like the rest of us,

669
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,670
只是想为自己的孩子创造条件呢?
just trying to do right by her kid?

670
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:04,710
我们居然在讨论这事 这已经很令人难以置信了
It's insane that we're even discussing this.

671
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:08,550
令人难以置信的是对于每个问题 我们的解决方案都是谋杀
What's insane is that our solution to every problem is murder.

672
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:11,220
以前一看到血 我就会害怕
I used to freak out whenever I saw blood.

673
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:12,890
现在 我连眼皮都不会眨一下
Now I barely blink at it.

674
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:17,810
不应该是这样的 这不是什么他妈的沃特电影
It shouldn't be that way.This isn't some fucking Vought movie.

675
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:21,940
暴力不是勇敢 恨我妈也不是
Violence isn't brave.Neither is hating my mom

676
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:25,110
恨火车头 恨任何人都不是
or A-Train or...anyone.

677
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:29,490
但原谅 释怀 怀有一丝怜悯之心
But forgiveness,letting go,a little fucking mercy...

678
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:31,280
那才是勇敢
that's brave.

679
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:35,950
这很疯狂 但也很勇敢
It's crazy.But it's brave.

680
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:40,760
我爸教给我的最后一件事 我只是想
It's about the last thing my dad ever taught me, and I just think...

681
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:45,710
如果我们要战胜怪物 就得开始展现出人性
...if we're ever gonna win against monsters,I think we need to start acting human.

682
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,180
那就做吧
Fuck it.

683
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:58,140
真的吗?就“那就做”吗?
Really?Just... fuck it?

684
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:00,140
安妮 我们可能横竖都是死
Annie, we're probably dead either way.

685
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:02,980
还不如昂首挺胸地搏一次
Might as well go out with our heads held high.

686
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:06,060
所以 那就做吧
So...fuck it.Oh.

687
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:07,190
很好
Great.

688
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:10,280
听着 尝试策反火车头?
Look,taking a chance with A-Train,

689
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:12,360
简直疯狂至极
that shit was crazy.

690
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:14,030
但看看结果如何
But look at how it turned out.

691
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,830
真他妈的
Shit.

692
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:22,250
那就做吧
Fuck it.

693
00:44:22,330 --> 00:44:24,790
休伊 如果你错了
Petit Hughie,if you're wrong...

694
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:26,250
信任 但要验证
Trust but verify.

695
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:29,840
话说回来 法兰奇 你能给纽曼注射病毒吗?
But, Frenchie, can you get that virus into Neuman's system?

696
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,760
用带有碳超材料尖端的飞镖枪
With a carbon metamaterial tip to a dart gun

697
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:36,430
我会瞄准软组织
and I aim for soft tissue...

698
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,870
也许吧 那就去吧
...perhaps.Then do it.

699
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:42,730
因为如果这是个陷阱 至少我们没有盲目地跳进去
'Cause if this is a trap, at least we ain't walking in blind.

700
00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:46,440
而且 休伊 如果纽曼有一丝一毫不对劲
And, Hughie, if Neuman even blinks funny,

701
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:50,320
弗兰奇就会干掉她 很公平 明白
Frenchie's dropping her.Fair. Got it.

702
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,740
听着 我们需要 住口
Look, Annie...Shut up.

703
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:59,660
你要去检查每一种已知的 人类会得的疾病
You are getting tested for every single disease known to mankind.

704
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:01,290
好吗?
Okay?

705
00:45:01,370 --> 00:45:03,040
我可不想被感染上梅毒
I'm not getting Shifter syphilis.

706
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:12,050
太他妈的好了 休伊!太他妈的好了!
Fuck yeah, Hughie. Fuck yeah.

707
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,140
你真的认为这样做是明智的吗?
You really think this is wise?

708
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:23,060
如果休伊是对的呢?
What if Hughie's right?

709
00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:29,270
如果宽恕是 我们能做的最好的事情呢?
What if forgiveness is the best we can do?

710
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,480
连纽曼都能宽恕?
Even to Neuman?

711
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:33,690
宽恕纽曼
To Neuman.

712
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:36,030
也宽恕我们自己
To ourselves.

713
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:41,660
与我们相比 宽恕纽曼很容易 对吧?
Neuman is easy compared to us.

714
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,500
怎么做?
How?

715
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:52,000
我想我们可以每天都做出一点尝试
We try a little every day, I guess.

716
00:45:59,050 --> 00:46:05,020
你记得我之前说 你应该和科林在一起吗?
You know how I said you should be with Colin?

717
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:11,190
我撒了谎
I lied.

718
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:15,900
我只是觉得你值得
I just thought you deserved to be with someone...

719
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:24,040
跟比我好的人
Better than me.

720
00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:27,000
在一起
Mon coeur...

721
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:31,460
没有人
...there is no one...

722
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,170
比你更好
...better than you.

723
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,090
你们知道我能听到
You know I can hear you.

724
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:19,670
“马文说有人意图 刺杀辛格尔
"Marvin said there was an attempt on Singer's life.

725
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:24,430
没得手”我们知道 只是你不用担心这些事 仅此而已
He survived."We know.There's just some things you don't got to worry about. That's all.

726
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:26,410
他们还会再次尝试
They're gonna try again, and that virus

727
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:27,930
那种病毒是仅存的希望
is a Hail Mary at best.

728
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:30,520
我们没时间了 也没有更好的选择
We are out of time and out of better options.

729
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,140
莱恩需要知道真相
Ryan needs to know the truth.

730
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:35,150
会告诉他的 什么真相?
And we'll get there.What truth?

731
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:40,990
意图暗杀总统 是你父亲下的命令
The assassination attempt,it was on your father's orders.

732
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:43,280
什么?
What?

733
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,700
还有37号航班
And Flight 37...

734
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:49,120
飞机上的每一个人都是祖国人杀死的
Homelander killed every soul on board.

735
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,200
格蕾丝
Grace.

736
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:52,370
你在说谎 我们有视频为证
You're lying.We have it on video.

737
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:54,170
还有无数其他的人也惨遭他的毒手
And he's murdered countless more.

738
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:56,100
你父亲并不是你想像的那样 别说了
Your father isn't who you think he is.Just stop.

739
00:47:56,130 --> 00:47:58,410
他并没跟你妈发生婚外恋 格蕾丝!
And he wasn't having an affair with your mother.Grace.

740
00:47:58,460 --> 00:47:59,550
他强奸了她!
He raped her.

741
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:12,390
对不起 孩子
I'm sorry, son.

742
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,730
然后呢?
And?

743
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:19,860
你的心在狂跳 你有事瞒着我
Your heart's pounding.There's something you're not telling me.

744
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:21,860
唯一能阻止他的人就是你
And you're the only one who can stop him.

745
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:24,030
阻止他?
S-Stop him?

746
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:26,030
你是说杀了他吗?
Like, kill him?

747
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:27,530
不 我下不去手
No. No, I can't.

748
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:28,910
别让我去
Don't ask me to.

749
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:30,200
莱恩 你很强大
Ryan, you're strong.

750
00:48:30,290 --> 00:48:31,910
他更强大!我们会训练你
He's stronger.We'll train you.

751
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,100
让你做好准备 你们想让我跟你们一起走 是为了这个目的吗?
Get you ready.So this is why you want me to go with you?

752
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:36,790
这样 你们就能教我 如何杀掉我生父?
So you can teach me how to kill my dad?

753
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,880
我得走了 留下来
I have to go.No, just stay.

754
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:42,050
我们会一起讨论 我不想讨论
We'll talk it out together.I don't want to talk.

755
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:43,840
我会回来的 我只是需要思考
I'll be back, I just need to think.

756
00:48:43,930 --> 00:48:46,110
听着 伙计 不会再有下次了
Listen, Ryan, there ain't gonna be another time for you and me.

757
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:49,350
我们暂时先冷静下 好吗?你不能离开
All right?Let's just take a breather. Yeah?You can't leave.

758
00:48:54,770 --> 00:48:56,690
等等
Wait.

759
00:48:56,770 --> 00:48:58,900
这些墙有近两米厚
These walls are six feet thick.

760
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:00,900
这是中情局的黑兹莱特安全屋
This is the CIA's Hazlet safe house.

761
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:02,530
旨在关住你这样的人
Designed to hold people like you.

762
00:49:02,610 --> 00:49:05,240
我可以把我们封死在这里 用氟烷充满房间
I could seal us in here, flood the room with halothane.

763
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:07,450
我们都美美地睡个一睡不醒的觉
And we all take a nice, long nap.

764
00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:10,030
但我不想那样做 孩子 你们早有预谋
But I don't want to do that, kiddo.You planned this.

765
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:12,370
你们把我带到这里来是为了困住我
All along. You, you brought me here to trap me.

766
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:14,290
不 我们带你来这里是为了帮助你
No, no. We brought you here to help you.

767
00:49:14,370 --> 00:49:16,870
除非我同意为你们杀人 否则 你们就会把我关在这里!
You're locking me in a cage unless I agree to be your weapon.

768
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,630
就像他们对我父亲那样 事实并非如此 老实说
Just like they did to my dad.That ain't the way it is, honest.

769
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:26,130
让我走 莱恩 失去孙子时
Let me go.Ryan.When I lost my grandkids, it left

770
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:29,300
我内心空空如也 丧失了全部的希望
this big empty black hole inside me.

771
00:49:29,390 --> 00:49:32,260
可最伟大的奇迹出现了
Then the greatest miracle came along.

772
00:49:32,350 --> 00:49:34,100
你
You.

773
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:39,310
我爱你 孩子
I love you, kiddo.

774
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:40,940
求你了
Please.

775
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:44,110
格蕾丝 我想离开
Aunt Grace... I want to leave.

776
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:45,950
对不起 别挡我的路
I'm sorry.Get out of my way.

777
00:49:46,030 --> 00:49:48,740
格蕾丝 抱歉
Grace.I'm sorry.

778
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:50,830
不!
No!

779
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,100
什么?
What?

780
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:01,230
我们进来了
Hello, hello.

781
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:06,940
上次见面后 你把牙套摘下来了
You took your braces off, since last time we saw you.

782
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:09,200
我们别搞这套
Let's not do that.Uh-huh.

783
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,160
纽曼 要怎么做?
How's this gonna work, Neuman?

784
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:12,700
简单
Simple.

785
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:16,790
你们帮我摆脱祖国人 还有辛格尔在中情局的人
You help me get clear of Homelander,and Singer's people at the CIA.

786
00:51:17,870 --> 00:51:20,040
我悄无声息地走人
And I go quietly.Mm.

787
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:23,540
你欠我们一份人情 不止一份人情
And you'll owe us one.A lot more than one.

788
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,550
我会欠你们很多人情
I will owe you many.

789
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:33,180
很好 所以 你会帮我们打倒沃特
Great. So you're gonna help us take down Vought

790
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:34,930
还有祖国人
and Homelander.

791
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:47,360
布彻尔?
Butcher?

792
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:50,900
没有交易可做
No deals.

793
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:55,200
我可以解释 好吗?没事的 我知道
I can explain, all right?It's all good. I know

794
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,800
这看起来是什么样 我们以前经历过那么多事
what this looks like, but with everything that we've been through together,

795
00:51:57,830 --> 00:52:01,710
我从没有要求过你相信我 这一次 我要你信任我
I've never once asked you to trust me. I am asking now.

796
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:04,210
就像你过去信任莱尼一样
Like the way you used to trust Lenny.

797
00:52:06,630 --> 00:52:09,050
拜托了 布彻尔
Please, Butcher.

798
00:52:32,990 --> 00:52:33,900
住手!

799
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:43,580
住手!
Stop!

800
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,290
不
No, no, no, no.

801
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:23,950
别动!
Stop. Stop.

802
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:28,000
这是自杀
It's suicide.

803
00:53:30,590 --> 00:53:33,090
病毒给我 谢谢 法兰奇
I'll be taking that virus now, thanks, Frenchie.

804
00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:34,590
绝对不行
Ain't no fucking way.

805
00:53:35,930 --> 00:53:37,510
你注射了五号
You took V?

806
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:40,260
它也会干掉你
It will work on you, too.

807
00:53:54,530 --> 00:53:58,110
如果我是你们 就不会犹豫不决
If I were you lot,I wouldn't hang about.

808
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:05,000
顺便说一句
Oh, by the way.

809
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:11,130
不用谢
You're all fucking welcome.

810
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:31,810
突发新闻 据报道 白宫处于封锁状态
We are interrupting our regular reporting with a breaking news story,

811
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:31,860
插播一条突发新闻

812
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:34,150
对不起 我只是
that at... I'm sorry, I'm just

813
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:37,110
在看制作人 已被证实了吗?
looking to my producers here. Is this confirmed?

814
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:40,030
他们 他们告诉我消息已被证实
They're, they're, they're telling me it has been.

815
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:43,660
当选副总统 维多利亚纽曼去世了
The Vice President-Elect, Victoria Neuman, is dead.

816
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:45,910
全世界知晓她是超人类之后
Assassinated today only hours

817
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,210
才过了几个小时 她就被暗杀了
after revealing to the world that she is super-abled...

818
00:54:49,290 --> 00:54:51,380
莱恩在哪里?
Where's Ryan?

819
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:54,250
毕竟这些都是为了他 对吗?
This was all for him after all, right?

820
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:58,300
你来这里做什么?庆祝
What are you doing here?Celebrating.

821
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:00,090
我们赢了 给
We won. Here.

822
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:05,220
一切都毁了 计划未能奏效
Everything's turned to shit.Plan's dead.

823
00:55:05,310 --> 00:55:07,270
这就是计划
This is the plan.

824
00:55:07,350 --> 00:55:13,110
当然 略有偏差 但我们达成了目标
I mean, sure, a few curveballs,but, uh, we got here.

825
00:55:13,190 --> 00:55:15,110
不能将计划全盘托出而已
Just had to keep a few bits to myself.

826
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:16,980
让你毁掉的那部分
You know, the bits you'd fuck up by...

827
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:20,360
你知道 你就是那种人嘛
...you know, being you.

828
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:23,570
纽曼本来就是个可怜虫 固执 想法太多
Neuman would have been a shit patsy.Stubborn, too many ideas.

829
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:25,700
所以 我选择了另一种方法
So I went another way.

830
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:28,330
鲍勃辛格本人下的暗杀令
...Bob Singer himself ordering the assassination.

831
00:55:28,410 --> 00:55:30,910
如果你们按照我的命令杀了纽曼
If you'd killed Neuman like I ordered,

832
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,250
我们就不会被困在地下四层 玩袖珍高尔夫球了
we wouldn't be stuck four stories underground playing pocket pool.

833
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:35,750
现在 我们开始直播
And now we go live.

834
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:40,170
您看到的画面是当选总统罗伯特辛格
Okay, that's President-Elect Robert Singer taken into custody by federal agents...

835
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:41,550
被联邦特工拘留
She tried to kill me first.

836
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:44,720
在史无前例的事态转变中
...in an unprecedented turn of events that is

837
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:48,680
那肯定是最为黑暗的日子之一
certain to go down as one of the darkest days...

838
00:55:51,270 --> 00:55:53,400
找你的
It's for you.

839
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:59,280
是谁?卡尔霍恩众议院议长
Who is it?Oh, Speaker of the House Calhoun.

840
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:02,740
一旦援引第25号修正案 他就是下一个总统候选人
Once they invoke the 25th,he's next in line to be president.

841
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:05,030
他想向你宣誓效忠
He'd like to pledge his allegiance to you.

842
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:12,920
向我?
To me?

843
00:56:14,330 --> 00:56:15,420
就像我承诺的那样
Just like I promised.

844
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:16,750
我们说好的
We had a deal.

845
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:18,170
是的 我破坏了协议
Yeah, well, I broke the deal.

846
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:19,920
我没有
I didn't.

847
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:23,630
我告诉过你 你可以相信我 亲爱的
I told you,you could trust me, boo.

848
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:25,720
我支持你
I got your back.

849
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:37,980
但我 把你赶了出去 就像 你是
I-I threw you out like...

850
00:56:39,110 --> 00:56:40,400
垃圾
...like garbage.

851
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:43,650
你为什么要这样做?
Why would you do this?

852
00:56:45,950 --> 00:56:47,950
看看我是否做得到
To see if I could.

853
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:52,200
谢谢
Thank you.

854
00:56:52,290 --> 00:56:54,540
太有趣了
This was so much fun.

855
00:56:56,630 --> 00:56:59,130
只是 你知道 下次
Just, you know, next time,

856
00:56:59,210 --> 00:57:01,260
听我的
listen to me.

857
00:57:04,470 --> 00:57:06,010
下次?
Next time?

858
00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:08,100
没错 金发野心家!
Oh, hells yeah, blond ambition.

859
00:57:09,810 --> 00:57:12,140
准备好 进入第二阶段
Buckle up for phase two.

860
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:28,870
我是祖国人
Homelander speaking.

861
00:57:28,950 --> 00:57:32,120
因此 作为我的第一项正式动议
And that is why, as my first official act,

862
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:35,290
根据《宪法》第九条第一款
under Article One, Section Nine of the Constitution,

863
00:57:35,370 --> 00:57:37,880
我宣布戒严
I'm declaring martial law

864
00:57:38,130 --> 00:57:42,380
代表数百名全国范围内的 超级英雄宣布
and deputizing hundreds of superheroes nationwide,

865
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:47,590
他们将直接向祖国人汇报
who will report directly to Homelander himself.

866
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:49,470
以保持 谢谢您 总统先生
To keep...Thank you, Mr. President.

867
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:57,390
维多利亚纽曼 她是一个伟大的美国人
Victoria Neuman, she was a great American.

868
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:59,100
也是一位亲爱的朋友
And a dear, dear friend.

869
00:57:59,190 --> 00:58:04,030
被潜伏进我国政府的 暗黑势力集团的星光追随者
Murdered in cold blood by deep-state Starlighters

870
00:58:04,110 --> 00:58:06,450
冷血谋杀了
embedded in our own government.

871
00:58:06,530 --> 00:58:09,490
现在 我们拥有完全的合法权力
Now that we have full legal authority,

872
00:58:09,570 --> 00:58:12,700
一支名副其实的 超级英雄军队将被召唤
a veritable army of superheroes will be called upon

873
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:16,830
把这些叛徒从我们的政府中 以及街道上赶出去
to rout these traitors from our government and from our streets.

874
00:58:17,870 --> 00:58:20,040
美国将再度变得安全起来
America will be safe again.

875
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:23,880
对星光追随者们说两句 无论你们躲在哪里
And to the Starlighters,whatever rock you're hiding under,

876
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:26,800
我们很快就会找到你们
we're coming for you.

877
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,590
我会找到你们
I'm coming for you.

超人类英雄的新时代开始了
...a new age of superheroes begins.

880
00:59:14,970 --> 00:59:17,310
一觉醒来 我们的世界焕然一新
We wake up to a new world.

881
00:59:17,390 --> 00:59:22,940
这里充满希望 纯洁 耶稣的爱照耀着我们所有人
Where hope, purity and Jesus's love shine down upon us all.

882
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:27,570
孩子们可以在母亲的怀抱中安然睡去
Where children can sleep peacefully in their mothers' arms,

883
00:59:27,650 --> 00:59:31,990
因为他们知道 星光的恋童计划已被挫败
knowing Starlight's pedo agenda has been thwarted.

884
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,030
红河集体之家

885
00:59:33,370 --> 00:59:35,080
不好 不!

886
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:40,830
喜美子!
Kimiko!

887
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:08,230
在这里 美国终于看到了 觉醒暴民的真面目
Where America finally sees the woke mob

888
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:11,110
他们是想要摧毁我们优良传统的怪物
for what it is: monsters who want to destroy

889
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:16,660
拐卖我们的孩子 促使我国男性女性化的怪物
our heritage, traffic our children,and feminize our men.

890
01:00:18,580 --> 01:00:21,410
在祖国人的领导下
Where, with Homelander's guidance...

891
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:27,540
我们将团结一致
...we will all come together in unity.

892
01:00:32,590 --> 01:00:34,180
不!
No.

01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:47,170
你知道多久了?
How long have you known?

900
01:01:47,250 --> 01:01:49,710
今天早上在机密报告会上才得知
Only since this morning's classified briefing.

901
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:54,760
我立即就联系了你
You were my first call.

902
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:57,550
向上帝发誓
Hand to God.

903
01:02:04,270 --> 01:02:06,440
开什么玩笑
You got to be fucking kidding me.

904
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:09,900
居然一直都在这里?
This whole time.

905
01:02:32,630 --> 01:02:34,590
献给拉里·克里普克
