1
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:15,140
What the fuck? That was so fucked up, you guys.

3
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,010
Get out. You're done.

4
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,810
There's one person you will never, ever defeat.

5
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:20,770
Good luck without me.

6
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,890
The answer to all our prayers.

7
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,480
A virus that kills Supes.

8
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,810
To make the virus strong enough to kill Homelander would evolve it

9
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,070
into something super lethal.

10
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:31,070
Global fucking pandemic.

11
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:32,030
I am you, 

12
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:34,610
which is why when I tell you you want to do this,

13
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:38,580
I am literally telling you that you fucking want to do this.

14
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,580
Kimiko!

15
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:43,750
Frenchie, that virus-- it ain't gonna cook itself, brother.

16
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,170
We ain't turning Ryan into an asset. He ain't ready.

17
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:50,000
Either we figure out how to train him or we figure out how to kill him.

18
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:52,130
Stop, stop! Just stop.

19
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:53,800
Your family isn't your enemy.

20
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,970
My mom wouldn't want any of this.

21
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:58,390
And that is why I got faith in the kid.

22
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:03,930
Once he's in office, we need to invoke the 25th amendment.

23
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,440
Who's handling all this?

24
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,060
Me. I fucking am. 

25
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,610
When Homelander chucks all the Starlighters into internment camps,

26
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:12,110
you're cool with that? You didn't know about the camps.

27
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:13,740
You just focus on the shooter.

28
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,450
Make sure he's good to go on the 6th.

29
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:17,570
-Are you okay? -It's like a furnace in there.

30
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,620
- Stop! - Fucking Supe shapeshifters.

31
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,830
Got to hand it to Sage, though.

32
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,000
Perfect choice for the job.

33
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:29,750
Good morning, patriots.

35
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,970
It's January 6, and this is VNN Today.

36
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,090
Stunning news out of Vought Studios,

37
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:41,680
who are canceling the eagerly anticipated film Training A-Train, 

38
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,390
though it's completely finished.

39
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,480
We just realized we'd make more from the write-off.

40
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,230
We go behind the scenes of a powerful new Vought PSA.

42
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:51,320
I take responsibility.

45
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:56,610
I take responsibility for racism.

46
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,660
Finally, Congress counts electoral votes today to certify the incoming president.

47
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,830
Usually a formality, Dakota Bob's extreme anti-Supe agenda

48
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:08,040
has made it anything but.

49
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:11,750
We will count the certificates in an orderly fashion,

50
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,710
with no debate.

51
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,960
Is that understood?

52
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:19,550
Now, as I was saying, after ascertaining the certificates are authentic...

53
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,470
Where's the fucking virus, Frenchie?

54
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,720
I'm close.

55
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,060
You know, once they bang that gavel,

56
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,850
Neuman's one goddamn head pop away from the Oval Office.

57
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,690
-How close? -Close-ish.

58
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,910
...counting the certificate of the vote 

59
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:44,580
of the state of Alabama?

60
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,370
- Hearing none. - The chair advises members of Congress...

62
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,670
No, I told you Vicky locked it all down.

63
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,540
Please lower your voice.

64
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:56,510
- Hey. - Hey.

65
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,380
Hey.

66
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,430
He-Hey. What--

67
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,430
What the hell are you wearing?

68
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:05,600
You don't like it?

69
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,930
No, I mean, I�� I love it.

70
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,890
It's just, I-is now really the time, 

71
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,650
with the whole country barreling towards 1984?

72
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:16,070
The night before my great-grandfather shipped out,

73
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:18,740
he put on his dress uniform,

74
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:23,660
barged into dinner at my great-grandmother's house,

75
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,740
and got down on one knee.

76
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,040
Okay.

77
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,540
Stand up. Please.

78
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,050
Hughie Campbell...

79
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,140
...will you marry me?

80
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,560
You need to stay right here, okay? Just don't move.

81
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,140
-Okay. -Do not move.

82
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:58,730
Hey.

83
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:05,160
Uh, I guess I'm-I'm doing this. Okay, then me, too, 

84
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,700
'cause I'm the one proposing.

85
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,540
Annie January, I am terrified of 

86
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:13,290
what's gonna happen. But I feel so...

87
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:19,590
...so lucky... that I get to face it all with you.

89
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,180
Okay, all right.

90
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,520
So, uh, 

91
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,770
yeah, all in all...

92
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,190
hard yes, let's get married.

95
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,790
Wow, that was... that was great.

96
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:53,870
Two fingers was a lot, but...

97
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,170
Sorry, I was just trying to level up.

98
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,170
Oh, no, it's... 

99
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,670
it's fine. It's great.

100
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,060
Where you going?

101
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,770
We need some champs to... celebrate.

102
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:22,740
And... not that Kirkland shit that's in the fridge.

103
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,860
-I'll be right back. -Yeah, okay. Yeah.

104
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:39,630
The certificate from Kansas, the parliamentarians advised me,

105
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:42,250
is the only certificate of vote from the state,

106
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:45,380
and has annexed to it a certificate from an authority...

107
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,800
You're 90 over 60.

108
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,340
That's low.

109
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,430
You don't fucking say?

110
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:02,230
You know, if you need any help...

111
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:07,360
-I don't need your help. -Really?

112
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:12,330
Seems to me you are shitting in a bedpan and days away from being planted.

113
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:15,200
And what do you have to show for it?

114
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:17,710
I mean, Singer-- he's as good as dead.

115
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:20,500
Homelander-- he won.

116
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,380
And you-- you gave away the virus.

117
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,130
The one fucking weapon that could've stopped him.

118
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,390
But we are gonna turn that frown upside down, my friend.

119
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:32,850
You know why?

120
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,470
'Cause you still have me.

121
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,020
You ain't even fucking real.

122
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,810
Well, now, that's an interesting philosophical question.

123
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,980
See, what is real are the fucking

124
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:48,030
V'd up tumors that are mushrooming inside your guts and noggin.

125
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,490
Super cancer.

126
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:55,450
What is real is that piece of you

127
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:59,620
that wants to burn every fucking Supe on Earth.

128
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:03,790
How is it you think you ripped Ezekiel into fun-sized little chunks?

129
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:07,670
I'm the one that gave you the juice that you needed.

130
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,170
And I can do it again.

131
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:14,350
All you have to do is hold up your end of the bargain.

132
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,470
Bargain?

133
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,980
What fucking bargain?

134
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,480
We go all the way.

135
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,940
I mean, come on, champ,

136
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:23,810
what's a little genocide between friends?

137
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:28,110
Just fuck off and let me die in peace, would you?

138
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:29,650
Wish I could.

139
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,870
Since you're here...

140
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:44,040
...be a doll and fetch us a pint, would you?

141
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:47,300
Come on, don't be a cunt. I'm fucking dying here.

142
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:50,130
Your dying's been pretty high on my wish list lately.

143
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,510
I appreciate what you're doing here for me.

144
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,220
Not one bit of this is for you.

145
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,180
All right, then.

146
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:01,770
Give us me phone. 

147
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:03,480
We got work to do.

148
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,140
Disgusting.

149
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,520
God damn it, Ryan.

150
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,080
Come here.

151
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,920
Come here. That's an order.

152
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,840
I'm your father.

153
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,760
Not him.

154
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,680
And I always will be.

155
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:15,070
Come here. Now.

156
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:19,490
Ryan.

157
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:22,530
Ryan!

159
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,260
Hey.

160
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:39,840
You know, I'd be careful with those...

161
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,140
...those Lean Lad Diet Lunches?

162
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:49,690
They cause kidney stones the size of jawbreakers.

163
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:52,310
There's a whole class action lawsuit against them.

164
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,940
-Come here. - Don't! Don't-don't fucking touch me.

165
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,650
Hey, chill, okay?

166
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,530
I just need a little recharge.

167
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,790
Why the fuck would I kill your mother?

168
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:07,120
That requires going to Sedona,

169
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,120
and no one should have to go to Sedona.

170
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:12,380
Get out of my head.

171
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,210
Oh, this?

172
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,130
I proposed to Hughie this morning.

173
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:24,220
I even told him the story about your great-grandparents.

174
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,520
And then we fucked to celebrate.

175
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,640
And we did butt stuff. He was so into it.

176
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,520
Oh, Christ.

177
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,730
It's like a fucking furnace in here.

178
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:35,650
Why?

179
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:38,030
Don't you just love proposals?

180
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:40,530
I mean, the joy on the other person's face

181
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:43,120
when they finally get their happily ever after.

182
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,580
-You're a psychopath. -Sociopath!

183
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:50,830
Which is to be expected, really. 

184
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,920
I mean, barely remember what I look like.

185
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,800
I do remember the first time I shifted, though.

186
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:02,180
One minute I was me and the next I was Ms. Jamison,

187
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,800
my preschool teacher.

188
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:07,930
And I could see every memory she'd ever had.

189
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:11,270
Fucking her husband's best friend, shoplifting lip gloss, 

190
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:14,350
hitting a student. But you know what the funny part is?

191
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:20,320
She felt justified in doing all those shitty things.

192
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,070
You all do it.

193
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:27,620
You all think you're the heroes of your own story.

194
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,200
I mean, look at you.

195
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:35,130
You're more moral and good and honest than the rest of us

196
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,590
just wallowing down in the shit.

197
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,510
-I don't think that. -Yeah, you do. Come on.

198
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:43,550
Mind reader, remember?

199
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:48,310
"Wasn't my fault

200
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:47,850
that I was a total cunt at the pageants, that was Mommy.

201
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:53,850
Or that I had to suck cock like a fucking popsicle to stay in The Seven. 

202
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,520
No. No, no, no, no, no.

203
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,650
I'm Annie January and it's not my fault."

204
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:00,150
Come on, say it with me now.

205
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,940
I'm Annie January and it's not my...

206
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:02,990
Fuck you!

207
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:07,740
You don't know anything about me or my life.

208
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,240
No? Then why aren't your powers working?

209
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:18,750
I mean, you weren't even the original choice to kill Singer,

210
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,920
but you're just such a fucking hot mess,

211
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:24,220
you made it undeniable.

212
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:26,550
Hey.

213
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,720
You'll have a couple of... non-consecutive life sentences

214
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,890
to work through your identity issues.

215
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:34,890
Please...

216
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:37,270
Poor Annie.

217
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,110
Please.

218
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:40,400
"Oh, God, 

219
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,360
I'm Annie January and I'm the only good one."

220
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:50,450
Here.

221
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:54,200
To wash down those Lean Lad Lunches.

222
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:01,250
Okay.

224
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:17,560
I've called you, like, 15 times. I was worried. I thought...

225
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,310
I don't know, I thought maybe you were...

226
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:21,610
Yeah, you and me both.

227
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:23,320
Look, we're kind of up against it right now.

228
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,150
They're only a few hours away from certifying the election

229
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,070
and then, you know, after that happens they're-they're coming for Singer.

230
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,740
We need your help.

231
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,160
Butcher?

232
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,040
When I was a lad,

233
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,330
I heard about this place in Nevada.

234
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:43,040
A steakhouse.

235
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:47,510
Where the birds get their baps out when they're bringing your ribeye.

236
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,220
Cool.

237
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,510
Lenny nearly pissed himself when I told him.

238
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,140
Thought it was the funniest thing he ever heard.

239
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,190
We was gonna go there someday.

240
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,820
Well...

241
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:14,740
Funny what you think about when your time's up, innit?

242
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,200
Butcher, where are you? 

243
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:18,000
I-I can come to you.

244
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,500
You know, we can figure this out.

245
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,040
Do us a favor, would you, Hughie?

246
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:28,300
Go there.

247
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,680
For me and Len, would you?

248
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,220
You can't fucking give up.

249
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:36,100
You can still fight.

250
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,600
Hughie, I asked you something.

251
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:42,190
Fine. I'll-I'll, um...

252
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,400
I'll go to the topless steakhouse for you.

253
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:47,940
Magic.

254
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:52,240
And, uh...

255
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,040
...tell the Boys I'm sorry, would you?

256
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,620
Tell the Boys I'm sorry

257
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:04,880
for, uh...

258
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:11,170
Just tell them I'm sorry.

259
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:16,760
Goodbye, Hughie.

260
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:29,860
Oh, hey, um,

261
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:33,570
have Negin get me a caramel pretzel s'more frappe from Jitter Bean.

262
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:36,910
Double whip. I'm just like molasses in winter today.

263
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,660
Ugh, God, that's enough, Amber. Thank you.

264
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,870
Good morning.

265
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:49,590
How are you doing this mor... Oh, God.

266
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,210
Excuse me.

267
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,880
Can we just make this quick, please?

268
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,050
I have slightly more important things to do today. Yes ma'am, of course.

269
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:56,970
Hey.

270
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,300
Stand by. Going in 

271
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:01,640
five, four, three...

272
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,310
Welcome to the show, folks. We got a real happy surprise for y'all today.

274
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:13,320
Homelander and vice president-elect Victoria Neuman.

275
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,200
Bless both your hearts for being here.

276
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,280
I'm more than happy to find time for my friend Homelander.

277
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:20,950
Yeah, let's cut the BS.

278
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,620
Dakota Bob says he's gonna 

279
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,670
pass nutbag anti-Supe laws in his first hundred days.

280
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:29,040
As his VP...

281
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:36,590
...staunch ally of the super-abled community,

282
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,050
I really think that it's important to--

283
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,010
Ally, Victoria, really?

284
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,060
We're here to tell the truth.

285
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:47,900
So just... tell the truth.

286
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:55,240
The truth is that the real issue here is lack of representation.

287
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,280
-And I want to make sure that you-- -Fine, you don't want to do it? I'll do it.

288
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:02,660
Victoria here is a superhero.

289
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,330
Thanks for the compliment.

290
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,880
But, like, I think the truth is we all want to be heroes,

291
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,500
but, um, I'm not literally a su--

292
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:15,550
Oh, fuck.

293
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:21,470
It's all true. Ms. Neuman here has been operating as

294
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:25,140
a secret dagger in the heart of the deep state,

295
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:27,390
standing up to the forces of darkness that want to

296
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,230
sodomize our democracy and our toddlers,

297
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:33,110
but it is time for the great awakening.

298
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:36,070
Where we go one, we go Vought, y'all.

299
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:37,650
We're gonna take a quick break...

300
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,200
Cunt's out of the bag, innit?

301
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:41,910
Now it gets interesting.

302
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,870
All right. Great show, guys.

303
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:47,750
Hey. 

304
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,170
Hey!

305
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:54,000
Fuck off! Hey.

306
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,380
I worked my whole life to keep that secret.

307
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,420
Well, secrets rot your soul.

308
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:00,340
You're unburdened. You should thank me. 

309
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,260
-Sage said-- -Fuck Sage. 

310
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,850
She's long gone. Listen to me.

311
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,220
Listen to me.

312
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,810
We are gonna change the world,

313
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:10,730
Vicky, for our kids and their kids.

314
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,770
The first super-abled president.

315
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,110
And you're a gal.

316
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,360
I'll be impeached.

317
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:20,410
Why would we care?

318
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:23,280
-Because I have to get re-elected in four years. -Says who?

319
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,990
-Article II of the Constitution. -New world, new rules.

320
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,000
Now shut the fuck up and listen.

321
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,960
Our fates are connected now.

322
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,120
Singer's as good as dead, 

323
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:33,330
and I am the only fucking friend you've got left.

324
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:35,960
The train has left the station, gorgeous, 

325
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,050
and you're on it.

326
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:41,380
You'll have to arrest half your company. Half the country.

327
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:47,810
Wait, you think I didn't think of that? Of course I thought of that.

328
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:49,810
Fuck.

329
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:52,190
Ashley, on me now.

330
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:54,730
Um, the response on socials has been mixed.

331
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:57,650
I need you to make a list of anyone within the company

332
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:01,780
that has damaging information on me or The Seven-- but mostly me--

333
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,910
anyone with any fucking leverage whatsoever.

334
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:06,080
-Yes. -I need this fucking list yesterday.

335
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,120
Yes, sir.

336
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,410
You're a good girl.

337
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,630
Um... that doesn't sound good, Ashley.

338
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:15,080
Oh, yeah, no shit, Ashley. 

339
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:16,380
Sorry, Ashley. 

341
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,550
The purpose of the joint session having concluded,

342
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:24,220
pursuant to Senate Concurrent Resolution 1, 118th congress,

344
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:28,640
the chair declares the joint session resolved.

346
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,600
...certified the election despite the shocking news

347
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:36,440
that vice president-elect Victoria Neuman is super-abled.

348
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:39,280
Protests have erupted all over the country as Starlighters...

349
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,690
That's the ballgame.

350
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,110
Open season on Singer now. Frenchie, tell me you got something.

351
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,240
You want to try this instead of me?

352
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,450
I'm working as fast as I can.

353
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,200
Not fast enough.

354
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:52,870
Multiple protestors have been injured...

355
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,790
You seeing this?

356
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:55,710
Get all the dirt on Neuman ready in case we need to go nuclear.

357
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,210
Wait, wait, wait, wait. What happened to the virus?

358
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:58,920
There is no fucking virus.

359
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,920
What? 

360
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,260
Fuck.

361
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:04,130
Okay, well, you know she's gonna kill us if we leak this, right?

362
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:06,140
If I had another fucking choice, trust me, I'd take it.

363
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,260
All right, here goes fucking nothing.

364
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:10,100
Hi.

365
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:13,140
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Fuck!

366
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,770
-What? What happened? -It's all gone.

367
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:17,520
Everything we have on Neuman-- the murders, her ties to Stan Edgar, everything.

368
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,360
Okay, okay, wait a second.

369
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,900
You got backups, right-- another computer or the motherfucking cloud?

370
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,490
You're not hearing me. It's all gone. 

371
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:24,490
The originals, the backups, we've got nothing.

372
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,990
Ain't nothing stopping her then.

373
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,530
Only one thing left to do.

374
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,330
Frenchie, you stay here, work fucking faster.

375
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:34,830
Kimiko, you're with me.

376
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:37,670
Listen, Hughie, I'm sending you coordinates. You and Annie, meet there ASAP.

377
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:38,710
What's the plan?

378
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:40,590
We fucked up our chance at offense. 

379
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:42,550
All we got now is defense.

380
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:49,720
I am as shocked as you are by this profound betrayal of trust.

381
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:54,980
In America, you tell people who you are before you ask for their vote.

382
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:59,480
That's why I'm calling for a new, free and fair election.

383
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,940
Mark my words,

384
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,280
if Victoria Neuman becomes vice president,

385
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,360
it will be over my dead body

386
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,950
because she had me assassinated.

387
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:12,330
Wow. Guess you got to go take a bullet for the geezer, don't you?

388
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:14,370
I think it's more important that I stay here.

389
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,540
-Your visitor's here. -Send him in.

390
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,760
Man, this is never gonna work.

391
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:33,680
You got my text.

392
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,390
I'm glad you came.

393
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,690
You're almost taller than me now.

394
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:41,360
There's no saving the kid. He can't escape his own blood.

395
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,520
What are they feeding you?

396
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:44,610
And tell me there's vegetables involved somewhere.

397
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:46,360
There's lettuce on the burgers.

398
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,030
I've missed you, kiddo.

399
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:51,370
Listen, Ryan,

400
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:55,540
we, uh, need to have a bit of a serious chin wag.

401
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:58,160
You look... really sick.

402
00:22:58,660 --> 00:22:59,710
Don't I know it.

403
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:05,670
Mate, I've wished myself dead more times than I can count.

404
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,970
And now here I am,

405
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:14,060
and I want some more time. But I don't have it,

406
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:16,350
and I don't have time to ease you into this.

407
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:18,560
You're gonna have to kill him, Billy.

408
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,560
You can't go back to the tower.

409
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:23,060
- You need to go with Aunt Grace. - What?

410
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,730
- Like when? - Now. Right now. 

411
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,240
No, I-I can't.

412
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,780
-My dad would find me. -Not this time, kiddo.

413
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,700
Well...

414
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:34,870
I'm not sure I want to leave.

415
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:36,830
I kind of like it there. 

416
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:38,200
-Well, parts of it. -You see? 

417
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:40,960
You got to stab him with the virus and you got to do it today.

418
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,500
Ryan, no.

419
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:45,000
- Your Dad is a-- - Grace.

420
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:48,300
Look...

421
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:52,300
when your mom died-- which weren't your fault...

422
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,300
...you heard what she said.

423
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:59,390
She had me promise to keep you safe, and that's all I'm trying to do here.

424
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,980
Now, if you're telling me, I mean, seriously telling me,

425
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:07,860
that the place you feel safest is with Homelander...

426
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,570
...then I ain't gonna stop you.

427
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:27,960
Do you want to play?

428
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:32,380
All right, then. 

429
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:33,470
Come on.

431
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:49,610
Have you seen Ryan?

432
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:51,820
No, but I can send a PA to go look, if you need.

433
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,070
No. No. 

434
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,360
Boys need their space.

435
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:56,120
-List? -Oh, yeah. 

436
00:24:56,780 --> 00:25:00,620
Um�� Sorry. Thank you. I highlighted anyone who's contract we'd have to pay out if they're...

437
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:05,880
-...let go. -Great. 

438
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,830
Thank you. Good job.

439
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,540
You're excused.

440
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:16,890
You know, no problem. I can get it.

441
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:27,730
Cilantro.

442
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:34,610
Gentlemen. The Seven is a circle of trust.

443
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:41,160
What we're gonna tell you is extremely sensitive.

444
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,910
-Got it? -O Captain, my Captain.

445
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:48,920
Robert Singer will be dead by end of business.

446
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,500
Neuman will be sworn in.

447
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,630
People will panic. 

448
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:55,130
There will be rioting, bloodshed, et cetera, et cetera.

449
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,300
Someone will have to swoop in and restore order.

450
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:05,310
We will put out the call to every Vought hero, every fucking one, 

451
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:08,730
to surround the Capitol, the White House, and the Pentagon.

452
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:11,520
Defending the rightful President Neuman.

453
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:13,650
Now, what I need you two--

454
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,320
Fuck's sakes, get a Ricola.

455
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:20,570
Sorry, sir. I'm-I'm so sorry. I'm just... the meds, you know.

456
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:24,410
You know, the... the meds.

457
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,210
They're just, they're causing a little

458
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:31,540
heart palpitation and a high fever, but it ain't no big thing.

459
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:33,960
Okay, well, you're coughing all over me, and it's fucking disgusting.

460
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:35,880
Go further down. Scoot.

463
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:52,610
Further.

464
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:04,290
As I was saying...

465
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:11,540
...everyone on this list needs to be removed.

466
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,300
Permanently, by the end of the day.

467
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:19,010
Hey, if we're thinking about who's got the most dirt on us,

468
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:21,300
wouldn't Ashley's name be at the top of the list?

469
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,390
Yeah. Sure. Good idea.

470
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:32,270
Does anybody know Ashley's last name?

471
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:40,740
What the...?

473
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:43,470
You seriously telling us the Shifter can get through that?

474
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:45,720
Look, for all I fucking know, they could be in here already.

475
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:49,060
So, from now on, everybody moves with a partner,

476
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,810
and you check in every five minutes on the dot.

477
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:54,190
Stay sharp and follow motherfucking orders.

478
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:55,560
Come on, let's get to it.

479
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:57,730
Sir, you're gonna be all right.

480
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,780
If you'd killed Neuman like I ordered,

481
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:03,860
we wouldn't be stuck four stories underground playing pocket pool, 

482
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,070
idiot.

483
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:08,910
Balls.

484
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:11,750
Kimiko, stay on Singer.

485
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,550
Do you really think the Shifter is in here?

486
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:22,720
I hope not, for Christ's sake, but it could be anyone,

487
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,430
so eyes on everyone.

488
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:26,090
Okay. You got it.

489
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:30,100
Jesus.

490
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:33,600
-You okay? -Yeah. 

491
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,690
Yeah, I'm fine.

492
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:37,100
I'm just... warm.

493
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,940
It's like a furnace in here.

494
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,280
It's like a furnace in there.

495
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,080
Y-You should go find some water.

496
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:55,040
Yeah. Okay. Do you want one?

497
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,370
-I would love one. -I'll be right back. 

498
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,250
Okay.

499
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:07,680
Holy fucking shit.

500
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:35,000
Balls.

501
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:38,620
Hey. Hey, man. Hey, just... sorry. Just something... stupid.

502
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:40,580
Real quick, just don't look at me, look right into the room.

503
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:42,590
Don't look at me, just look forward.

504
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:45,380
-Don't look at me, just look forward. -All right, all right, okay.

505
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,470
Stay cool.

506
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,380
It's Annie.

507
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:49,340
What's Annie?

508
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:51,300
The Shifter, it's Annie. 

509
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:53,140
-What? -She's the Shifter. Don't look at me, just look forward.

510
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,810
-How do you know? -Just trust me, 

511
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:58,020
I don't know how or when they switched, but that is 100% percent not Annie.

512
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,060
Okay, okay, okay, listen.

513
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:02,610
The fate of the country relies on us keeping our shit together, so just chill--

514
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:04,650
- Hey. - Hey. 

515
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:05,820
- Hey. - Water?

516
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,280
- Thanks. - There you go.

517
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,950
Yeah, great.

518
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,330
What are you looking at?

519
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:23,170
I know.

520
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:29,510
Wow... you...

521
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,930
Congratulations. 

522
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:33,930
-Thank you. -Yep. We did that.

523
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:37,180
That is a thing...  that we did. 

524
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,810
For the record, I proposed. 

525
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:42,100
'Cause peg the patriarchy, right?

526
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:43,900
Yeah, peg the patriarchy. 

527
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:46,280
You got to peg it... peg it in all its holes.

528
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,860
Listen, getting hitched, best decision I ever made in my life,

529
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,780
so congratulations to you both.

530
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:53,240
But, uh, you know, Mother Nature's calling,

531
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,990
so I'm about to go hit the head, and... y'all just hold down the fort--

532
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,120
Yes, motherfucker.

533
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,410
- Sir, get down. - Sir, come with me.

534
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:02,040
Sir, this way.

535
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:04,920
Oh, shit.

536
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,810
Oh, goddamn it.

538
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,410
Go.

539
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:25,960
Come on.

540
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:27,580
How many fucking numbers are there?

541
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:29,460
Oh, God.

542
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,850
Take Singer. Go. Now.

543
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,810
- Let's go. - Go.

544
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,150
Hughie, go.

545
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:59,410
You really think your broke-down ass can take me?

546
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:03,540
You couldn't even blast yourself out, could you?

547
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,610
You're right.

548
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,990
I don't know if I'm a hero.

549
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:40,370
I don't know who the fuck I am.

550
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:46,620
But I do know that I'm the bitch beating your ass.

551
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,240
Victoria.

552
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,740
-Singer's alive. Your assassin failed. -What do you mean failed?

553
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:26,410
Now the CIA's gonna find an even deeper hole to hide him in.

554
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,210
Well, there's nothing on the news.

555
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:32,130
Because he's gonna hit me back quietly, and I'm fairly fucking sure he has the means to do it.

556
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:33,500
Where is Sage?

557
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:36,420
Maybe she can find a way out of this idiotic mess you've dropped us in.

558
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:38,050
We have not failed. 

559
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:40,470
I will end Singer myself if I have to.

560
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:45,390
You will be president, and you will go along with every word I say

561
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:49,310
as if my hand was jammed up your tight, puckered little asshole,

562
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:51,020
like the puppet you've always been.

563
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:55,730
And, Victoria, if you stray even an inch off that path,

564
00:35:55,820 --> 00:36:00,070
I will make sure Zoe knows nothing but pain for the rest of her life,

565
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:05,280
and I will send you a piece of her every year for the fucking rest of yours.

566
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:07,790
There is no fail.

567
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,380
Well, guess who has two thumbs

568
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:23,760
and is the motherfucking genius of all fucking geniuses.

569
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:25,470
The virus is...

570
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,430
What happened to you guys?

572
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:59,590
Hello, hello.

573
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,470
Um, you okay?

574
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:04,180
I'm great.

575
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:06,470
Thank God you showed up.

576
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:10,060
-How'd you find us, anyway? -Find Your Phone.

577
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:14,480
I actually also found your fianc��e.

578
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,190
Congratulations.

579
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:18,900
No, she's not... She wasn't my fianc��e. No, you're...

580
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:22,570
You put the ring on her finger, Hughie.

581
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:26,490
I know because I pried it off her fucking dead hand!

582
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:29,450
Look, I thought I was getting engaged to you, all right? She looked just like you, you know, 

583
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:32,750
right down to that freckle you have down...

584
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:33,870
So you did fuck her.

585
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,630
-I mean, you know-- -How many times?

586
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:39,040
Had to be less than...

587
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:41,510
...20.

588
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:44,470
Oh, my fucking God. I was gone for ten days.

589
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:46,130
She almost always initiated, and, again, 

590
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:48,640
I cannot overstate this enough, I thought it was you.

591
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,260
Yeah, and as long as you were getting laid, you didn't look too close.

592
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:52,850
That's the Annie you want.

593
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:54,810
Down to go down whenever. The perfect girl.

594
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:57,690
Not someone who is depressed or fucked-up

595
00:37:57,770 --> 00:38:00,820
or comes with any complications.

596
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,110
You want to know how I knew it wasn't you?

597
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:10,580
In the apartment she wore some designer dress,

598
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:13,200
and you always ditch your bra for sweats as soon as you get home.

599
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:15,370
She, she found your car keys

600
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:18,540
on the first try, and you have never, ever found your car keys in under 15 minutes.

601
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:19,500
But the final clue:

602
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:22,000
in the bunker she was sweating,

603
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:26,930
and you have always been and always will be 90% pashmina.

604
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,050
I love that about you.

605
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:33,020
All your weird, amazing fucked-up-ness, that's what makes you you.

606
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:35,810
Annie, please.

607
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,320
Fuck.

608
00:38:58,870 --> 00:38:59,750
Vicky?

609
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:00,920
I want out.

610
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:03,880
Sorry, is-is this a joke?

611
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:05,840
No.

612
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,220
It's gone too far.

613
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:10,390
No. No, you're just saying that 'cause the assassination failed.

614
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:12,350
No, I'm saying it 'cause it'll never fucking end.

615
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:15,890
Homelander's unhinged, he's not even listening to Sage anymore.

616
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:19,600
If I become president, I'm just gonna be a puppet, and if I fight back, he'll...

617
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:24,400
I'll resign without a fight.

618
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,110
You just need to get the CIA off my ass and get me and Zoe out.

619
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:28,320
Okay, fuck all the way off.

620
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,110
You're like the asshole who cried wolf.

621
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,950
-I mean, the shit that you have done-- -Oh, what?

622
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:34,950
Like how you got Sameer to cook up some more of the virus to kill me?

623
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,240
Oh, and, yeah, cut off his fucking leg!

624
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:41,580
Glad you two connected. Okay. So the leg thing wasn't me,

625
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:43,920
and you didn't exactly leave us with a ton of options.

626
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,880
Look, the point is, you hit me, I hit you back, and it never fucking ends.

627
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,260
WarGames, Hughie.

628
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,010
The only way to win is not to play.

629
00:39:58,230 --> 00:39:59,600
I thought I wanted this.

630
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:03,770
Not for Zoe or... Edgar but for me.

631
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:07,440
You know, I just... I wanted to feel safe, 

632
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:10,150
and not like that scared fucking kid at Red River.

633
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:16,330
But I don't feel safe, and I'm really fucking scared.

634
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:21,040
And I'm not getting Zoe killed over this.

635
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,040
This is the only way.

636
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:29,010
Vicky, I don't know how to trust you.

637
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:31,840
I'll tell you where Zoe is.

638
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,590
Is she okay?

639
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:37,510
Yeah, but if I get her, it'll draw too much attention.

640
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,680
And that's how you know you can trust me,

641
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,850
because I am trusting my daughter with you.

642
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:45,230
Please, Hughie.

643
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:49,730
You're literally the only person on Earth I can turn to right now.

644
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:03,040
Enough fucking running.

645
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,060
Sorry, bro, you're on the list.

646
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:20,350
Don't kill me. 

647
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:21,470
I can pay you. 

648
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:24,020
You're a writer. You don't get paid shit.

649
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,400
Please... I-I'll do anything.

650
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,440
Anything?

651
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:33,610
Tell me I'm the smartest superhero in The Seven.

652
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:38,410
You are, by far, the smartest superhero in The Seven.

653
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:40,120
You're brilliant, a genius.

654
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,950
And that you respect me the most. 

655
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,460
Besides Homelander, of course.

656
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:45,370
Of course. Of course I respect you.

657
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:46,790
You-You're amazing.

658
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,170
You're just saying that 'cause you're scared, aren't you?

659
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:51,800
No, I'm not.

660
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:54,090
-I swear. -Yeah, you are.

661
00:41:55,970 --> 00:41:57,430
But you know what, bro?

662
00:41:58,930 --> 00:42:00,100
That's good enough for me.

663
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,700
Yo, have you seen Ashley?

664
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:18,490
This is Ashley.

665
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:24,160
No, bro. The other Ashley.

666
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,670
- This Ashley's not even on the list. - Well, I don't know.

667
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:29,380
Everyone here's named fucking Ashley.

668
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,000
Bro.

669
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:41,550
Murder boner.

670
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:43,970
You've got to be kidding me.

671
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:46,350
Look, if we can flip Neuman, as powerful as she is,

672
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:48,770
with everything that she has on Vought, I mean,

673
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:50,650
if there's even a five percent chance.

674
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:53,480
Alors, what, just forget that Neuman is a monster?

675
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:55,030
I'm not saying that. I'm saying...

676
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,030
Look, we've all done bad shit.

677
00:42:57,530 --> 00:42:59,610
What if she's just fucked-up like the rest of us,

678
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:01,370
just trying to do right by her kid?

679
00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:04,410
It's insane that we're even discussing this.

680
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:08,160
What's insane is that our solution to every problem is murder.

681
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:10,920
I used to freak out whenever I saw blood.

682
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,420
Now I barely blink at it.

683
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:17,550
It shouldn't be that way. This isn't some fucking Vought movie.

684
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:21,090
Violence isn't brave. Neither is hating my mom

685
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:24,850
or A-Train or... anyone.

686
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:28,690
But forgiveness, letting go, a little fucking mercy--

687
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:30,520
that's brave.

688
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:35,400
It's crazy. But it's brave.

689
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,950
It's about the last thing my dad ever taught me, and I just think...

690
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:45,080
...if we're ever gonna win against monsters, I think we need to start acting human.

691
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:52,580
Fuck it.

692
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:56,380
Really? 

693
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:57,920
Just... fuck it?

694
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:59,970
Annie, we're probably dead either way.

695
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,890
Might as well go out with our heads held high.

696
00:44:02,970 --> 00:44:05,100
So... fuck it.

697
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:07,140
Great.

698
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:10,020
Look, taking a chance with A-Train,

699
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:11,350
that shit was crazy.

700
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:13,610
But look at how it turned out.

701
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:17,860
Shit.

702
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:21,990
Fuck it.

703
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,530
Petit Hughie, if you're wrong--

704
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:25,990
Trust but verify.

705
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:29,750
But, Frenchie, can you get that virus into Neuman's system?

706
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:33,040
With a carbon metamaterial tip to a dart gun

707
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:35,750
and I aim for soft tissue...

708
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,550
-...perhaps. -Then do it.

709
00:44:39,630 --> 00:44:42,630
'Cause if this is a trap, at least we ain't walking in blind.

710
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,930
And, Hughie, if Neuman even blinks funny,

711
00:44:46,970 --> 00:44:49,970
-Frenchie's dropping her. -Fair. Got it.

712
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,440
-Look, Annie-- -Shut up.

713
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:59,480
You are getting tested for every single disease known to mankind.

714
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:00,530
Okay?

715
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:02,780
I'm not getting Shifter syphilis.

716
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,750
Fuck yeah, Hughie. 

717
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:11,790
Fuck yeah.

718
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:18,750
You really think this is wise?

719
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,760
What if Hughie's right?

720
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:28,970
What if forgiveness is the best we can do?

721
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:31,220
Even to Neuman?

722
00:45:31,430 --> 00:45:33,390
To Neuman.

723
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,770
To ourselves.

724
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:40,900
Neuman is easy compared to us.

725
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:45,070
How?

726
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:51,700
We try a little every day, I guess.

727
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:04,760
You know how I said you should be with Colin?

728
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:10,890
I lied.

729
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:15,600
I just thought you deserved to be with someone...

730
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:23,740
Better than me.

731
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:33,790
...there is no one... better than you.

732
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:14,830
You know I can hear you.

733
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:20,210
"Marvin said there was an attempt on Singer's life. He survived." 

734
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:24,170
We know. There's just some things you don't got to worry about. That's all.

735
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:25,510
They're gonna try again, and that virus

736
00:47:25,590 --> 00:47:28,050
is a Hail Mary at best.

737
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:30,220
We are out of time and out of better options.

738
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:31,890
Ryan needs to know the truth.

739
00:47:31,970 --> 00:47:34,310
-And we'll get there. -What truth?

740
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:40,730
The assassination attempt, it was on your father's orders.

741
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:42,980
What?

742
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:44,610
And Flight 37...

743
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:48,240
Homelander killed every soul on board.

744
00:47:49,070 --> 00:47:49,950
Grace.

745
00:47:50,030 --> 00:47:51,910
-You're lying. -We have it on video.

746
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:53,870
And he's murdered countless more.

747
00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:55,830
-Your father isn't who you think he is. -Just stop.

748
00:47:55,910 --> 00:47:57,910
And he wasn't having an affair with your mother. 

749
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,290
-Grace. -He raped her.

750
00:48:10,130 --> 00:48:11,430
I'm sorry, son.

751
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:14,050
And?

752
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,600
Your heart's pounding. There's something you're not telling me.

753
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,600
And you're the only one who can stop him.

754
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:23,270
S-Stop him?

755
00:48:24,730 --> 00:48:25,770
Like, kill him?

756
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:27,280
No. No, I can't.

757
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:28,650
Don't ask me to.

758
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:30,700
-Ryan, you're strong. -He's stronger.

759
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:32,240
We'll train you. Get you ready.

760
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:34,320
So this is why you want me to go with you?

761
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:36,530
So you can teach me how to kill my dad?

762
00:48:37,410 --> 00:48:39,370
-I have to go. -No, just stay.

763
00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:41,790
-We'll talk it out together. -I don't want to talk.

764
00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:43,540
I'll be back, I just need to think.

765
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:45,790
Listen, Ryan, there ain't gonna be another time for you and me.

766
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:49,090
-All right? Let's just take a breather. Yeah? -You can't leave.

767
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:55,800
Wait.

768
00:48:56,970 --> 00:48:58,600
These walls are six feet thick.

769
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:02,230
This is the CIA's Hazlet safe house. Designed to hold people like you.

770
00:49:02,310 --> 00:49:05,400
I could seal us in here, flood the room with halothane.

771
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:07,150
And we all take a nice, long nap.

772
00:49:07,230 --> 00:49:08,860
But I don't want to do that, kiddo.

773
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:10,360
You planned this.

774
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:12,200
All along. You, you brought me here to trap me.

775
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:13,860
No, no. We brought you here to help you.

776
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:16,620
You're locking me in a cage unless I agree to be your weapon.

777
00:49:17,370 --> 00:49:20,450
-Just like they did to my dad. -That ain't the way it is, honest.

778
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:24,830
-Let me go. -Ryan. When I lost my grandkids, it left

779
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:29,050
this big empty black hole inside me.

780
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:32,010
Then the greatest miracle came along.

781
00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:33,590
You.

782
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:39,060
I love you, kiddo.

783
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:40,640
Please.

784
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:43,810
Aunt Grace... I want to leave.

785
00:49:43,890 --> 00:49:46,020
-I'm sorry. -Get out of my way.

786
00:49:46,730 --> 00:49:48,480
-Grace. -I'm sorry.

787
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:50,400
No!

788
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:55,590
What?

789
00:50:58,510 --> 00:50:59,680
Hello, hello.

790
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:07,020
You took your braces off, since last time we saw you.

791
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:08,020
Let's not do that.

792
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:10,400
How's this gonna work, Neuman?

793
00:51:11,150 --> 00:51:12,020
Simple.

794
00:51:12,610 --> 00:51:16,530
You help me get clear of Homelander, and Singer's people at the CIA.

795
00:51:17,490 --> 00:51:18,700
And I go quietly.

796
00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:22,580
-And you'll owe us one. -A lot more than one.

797
00:51:25,790 --> 00:51:27,830
I will owe you many.

798
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:29,620
Great. So 

799
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:32,460
you're gonna help us take down Vought

800
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:34,130
and Homelander.

801
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:47,100
Butcher?

802
00:51:49,230 --> 00:51:50,190
No deals.

803
00:51:52,190 --> 00:51:53,190
I can explain, 

804
00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:55,570
all right? It's all good. I know what this looks like, 

805
00:51:55,650 --> 00:51:59,490
but with everything that we've been through together, I've never once asked you to trust me. 

806
00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:00,660
I am asking now.

807
00:52:02,030 --> 00:52:03,660
Like the way you used to trust Lenny.

808
00:52:06,910 --> 00:52:08,450
Please, Butcher.

810
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:42,240
Stop!

811
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:23,400
Stop. Stop.

812
00:53:26,530 --> 00:53:27,740
It's suicide.

813
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:32,830
I'll be taking that virus now, thanks, Frenchie.

814
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:34,330
Ain't no fucking way.

815
00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:36,920
You took V?

816
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:39,250
It will work on you, too.

817
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:57,860
If I were you lot, I wouldn't hang about.

818
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:03,990
Oh, by the way.

819
00:54:08,410 --> 00:54:10,240
You're all fucking welcome.

820
00:54:27,590 --> 00:54:28,430
We are interrupting our regular reporting 

821
00:54:28,510 --> 00:54:31,560
with a breaking news story,

822
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:34,930
that at-- I'm sorry, I'm just looking to my producers here. 

823
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:36,640
Is this confirmed?

824
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:39,730
They're, they're, they're telling me it has been.

825
00:54:39,810 --> 00:54:43,360
The Vice President-Elect, Victoria Neuman, is dead.

826
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:46,780
Assassinated today only hours after revealing to the world 

827
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:48,570
that she is super-abled...

828
00:54:49,070 --> 00:54:50,200
Where's Ryan?

829
00:54:51,910 --> 00:54:54,000
This was all for him after all, right?

830
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:57,540
-What are you doing here? -Celebrating.

831
00:54:58,580 --> 00:54:59,830
We won. Here.

832
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:04,960
Everything's turned to shit. Plan's dead.

833
00:55:05,420 --> 00:55:07,010
This is the plan.

834
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:12,300
I mean, sure, a few curveballs, but, uh, we got here.

835
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:15,270
Just had to keep a few bits to myself.

836
00:55:15,350 --> 00:55:16,730
You know, the bits you'd fuck up by...

837
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:19,400
��you know, being you.

838
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:23,360
Neuman would have been a shit patsy. Stubborn, too many ideas.

839
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,400
So I went another way.

840
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:28,320
...Bob Singer himself ordering the assassination.

841
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:30,780
If you'd killed Neuman like I ordered,

842
00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:33,990
we wouldn't be stuck four stories underground playing pocket pool.

843
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,240
And now we go live.

844
00:55:35,330 --> 00:55:37,710
Okay, that's President-Elect Robert Singer

845
00:55:37,790 --> 00:55:40,250
taken into custody by federal agents...

846
00:55:40,330 --> 00:55:43,590
...in an unprecedented turn of events that is

847
00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:47,760
certain to go down as one of the darkest days--

848
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:53,180
It's for you.

849
00:55:56,180 --> 00:55:58,730
-Who is it? -Oh, Speaker of the House Calhoun.

850
00:55:59,310 --> 00:56:02,440
Once they invoke the 25th, he's next in line to be president.

851
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:04,440
He'd like to pledge his allegiance to you.

852
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:12,660
To me?

853
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:15,370
Just like I promised.

854
00:56:15,450 --> 00:56:16,410
We had a deal.

855
00:56:16,490 --> 00:56:17,910
Yeah, well, I broke the deal.

856
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
I didn't.

857
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:22,830
I told you, you could trust me, boo.

858
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:24,630
I got your back.

859
00:56:34,890 --> 00:56:37,260
I-I threw you out like...

860
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:39,810
...like garbage.

861
00:56:42,270 --> 00:56:43,400
Why would you do this?

862
00:56:45,690 --> 00:56:46,770
To see if I could.

863
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,110
Thank you.

864
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:54,280
This was so much fun.

865
00:56:56,330 --> 00:56:58,790
Just, you know, next time,

866
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:00,830
listen to me.

867
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:05,130
Next time?

868
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:07,710
Oh, hells yeah, blond ambition.

869
00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:11,130
Buckle up for phase two.

870
00:57:27,270 --> 00:57:28,480
Homelander speaking.

871
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:32,110
And that is why, as my first official act,

872
00:57:32,190 --> 00:57:35,820
under Article One, Section Nine of the Constitution,

873
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:37,620
I'm declaring martial law

874
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:42,080
and deputizing hundreds of superheroes nationwide,

875
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:46,460
who will report directly to Homelander himself.

876
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:49,170
-To keep-- -Thank you, Mr. President.

877
00:57:54,010 --> 00:57:55,890
Victoria Neuman, 

878
00:57:55,970 --> 00:57:58,800
she was a great American. And a dear, dear friend.

879
00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:03,770
Murdered in cold blood by deep-state Starlighters

880
00:58:03,850 --> 00:58:06,190
embedded in our own government.

881
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:09,610
Now that we have full legal authority,

882
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:12,440
a veritable army of superheroes will be called upon

883
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:16,570
to rout these traitors from our government and from our streets.

884
00:58:17,570 --> 00:58:19,740
America will be safe again.

885
00:58:20,450 --> 00:58:23,620
And to the Starlighters, whatever rock you're hiding under,

886
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:25,540
we're coming for you.

887
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:28,080
I'm coming for you.

888
00:58:30,290 --> 00:58:31,550
Because today...

889
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:35,760
...a new age of superheroes begins.

890
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:17,050
We wake up to a new world.

891
00:59:17,130 --> 00:59:22,680
Where hope, purity and Jesus's love shine down upon us all.

892
00:59:23,510 --> 00:59:27,430
Where children can sleep peacefully in their mothers' arms,

893
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:30,810
knowing Starlight's pedo agenda has been thwarted.

896
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,570
Kimiko!

897
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:09,020
Where America finally sees the woke mob

898
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:12,190
monsters who want to destroy

899
01:00:12,270 --> 01:00:16,400
our heritage, traffic our children, and feminize our men.

900
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:21,740
Where, with Homelander's guidance...

901
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:27,290
...we will all come together in unity.

902
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:33,920
No.

903
01:00:34,290 --> 01:00:35,290
No. No!

904
01:00:35,380 --> 01:00:36,630
No!

906
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:43,090
No!

907
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:02,650
We will make America strong again.

908
01:01:03,110 --> 01:01:05,320
Proud again.

909
01:01:10,580 --> 01:01:14,920
And most of all, we will make America super again.

910
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:46,870
How long have you known?

911
01:01:47,410 --> 01:01:49,740
Only since this morning's classified briefing.

912
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:53,910
You were my first call.

913
01:01:55,870 --> 01:01:57,250
Hand to God.

914
01:02:04,050 --> 01:02:05,930
You got to be fucking kidding me.

915
01:02:08,390 --> 01:02:09,680
This whole time.
