- 为他的爱心鼓掌 - 不
- Give it up for this guy. - No, no, no.

8
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:35,700
我跟其他人不一样 我更优秀
I'm not just like the rest of you, I'm better.

9
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,950
祖国人是个该死的精神病患者
Homelander is a fucking psychopath.

10
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,370
祖国人是保护他们的人
Homelander is protecting them.

11
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,410
你说你会一直照顾我 你保证过的
You said you'd always looked out for me. You promised!

12
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,130
- 也许我不想看到你 - 我恨你
- Well, maybe I don't want to look at you. - I hate you.

13
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,130
这位小朋友是我儿子
This little guy here is my son.

14

你帮我个小忙 我就帮你
You help me out with one small favor, and I'll help you.

16
00:00:58,430 --> 00:00:59,510
你有没有把东西带来
Do you have it or not?

原始配方 11种原料都齐全着呢
Original recipe, all 11 herbs and spices.

18
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:03,930

Just a pinch.

19
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:07,480
我叫安妮詹纽艾瑞 我他妈的不干了
My name is Annie January, and I fucking quit.

20
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,230
我认为你是英雄克星之一
I say you're one of the Boys.

21
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:14,150
你就像条小疯狗 但很忠于手握拴狗链子的人
You are like rabid little doggy, but loyal to whoever holds this chain.

22
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:15,110
脑子从耳朵里流出来了
Your brain's leaking.

23
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:17,110
临时五号会害死你们俩
Temp V is gonna kill you both.

24
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:18,200
我还能活多久
How long I got? 

25
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,410
几个月 最多12个月
Months. 12 on the outside.

26
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:23,410
祖国人必须死 必须如此 不管付出多大的代价
Homelander needs to die. That's it. Whatever it takes.

27
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:25,710
士兵男孩就是我们的武器 他才能帮我们杀死祖国人
Soldier Boy's our weapon. He's how we kill Homelander.

28
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,580
你一直都知道 那个士兵男孩是我父亲吗
Did you know? That Soldier Boy was my father?

29
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,130
- 离开大楼  - 布彻尔 住手
- Get out of the building, now. - Butcher, stop!

30
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,640
你想要的一切 他就在那里
The thing you wanted, he's right fucking there, 

31
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,640
现在你居然反悔
and now you blink?

32
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,550
我许下了一个承诺
I made a promise.

33
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:41,220
你已经不再需要我了
You don't need me anymore.

34
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,260
我只能跳
I could jump.

35
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:43,890
你却可以飞
You can fucking fly.

36
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:57,530
{\an9}? God save the queen ?

37
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:00,740
{\an9}? The fascist regime ?

38
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,490
{\an9}? They made you a moron ?

39
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,870
{\an9}? A potential H-bomb ?

40
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,330
{\an9}? God save the queen ?

41
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,500
{\an9}? She ain't no human being ?

42
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,590
{\an9}? And there's no future ?

43
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,140
{\an9}? God saves. ?

44
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,180
晚上好
Good evening!

45
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,480
我知道现在已经是深夜了
Now, look, I know it's a late night,

46
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,520
所以我只想登台感谢各位的耐心等待
so I just wanted to come out and say thanks for your patience.

47
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,440
酒吧还在营业
The bar remains open, and, uh...

48
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,860
是的 罗伯特辛格尔 在科罗拉多州和内华达州获胜了
Oh, yeah, Colorado and Nevada just went to Robert Singer!

49
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,700
请继续关注大选
So, stay tuned.

50
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:49,580
我觉得我们很快 就会回到台上宣布大好消息
I feel like we're gonna be back very soon with some very good news.

51
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:52,590
谢谢 天佑美国
Thank you, and God bless America!

52
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:07,100
奶酪泡芙  他妈的 给我这玩意儿干什么
Motherfucking Gruyère puffs? What am I supposed to do with these?

53
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:10,770
她说你工作太辛苦了 需要多吃点
She says you've been working too hard. You need to eat more.

54
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:13,730
要是这次成功了 我保证把它们都吃光
We pull this off, I promise I'll grub all these motherfuckers.

55
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,780
休伊 快点 我得监控
Hughie, come on. I need eyes.

56
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,290
好的 再稍等一下
Yeah, yeah, just give me one... more second.

57
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:32,080
抱歉 连接器太多了 但我什么也看不见
Sorry, sorry. There's, like, a million connectors in here, and I can't see shit.

58
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,170
你是在帮忙还是在炫耀
Are you helping, or you just showing off?

59
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,510
当然是兼而有之啦
Oh, for sure both.

60
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,760
好了吗
Is that it?

61
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,180
好了 看得一清二楚
All right, live and in living color.

62
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,060
布彻尔 你听得到吗
Butcher, you copy?

63
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:51,190
妈的 布彻尔跑哪去了
Where the fuck is Butcher?

64
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,370
他妈的 别多嘴
Oh, don't you fucking start. 

65
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,030
我好得很
I'm fine.

66
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:08,120
屠夫
Charcuter.

67
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,830
你在跟谁说话
Who are you talking to?

68
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,040
一个词儿都没说
I ain't said a word.

69
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,170
谢啦
Geez.

70
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,710
好的
All right. 

71
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:22,050
来吧
Come on, then.

72
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,930
晚上好 混球们
Evening, cunts.

73
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,600
我们来这里是为了犯下叛国罪
We're here to commit a bit of high treason.

74
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,240
电梯上行
Going up.

75
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,920
嘿
Hey, whoa, hey.

76
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:00,090
计划是你在这里等 掩护我们出去 不是吗
The plan is you wait here, cover our exit, no?

77
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:02,760
别瞎扯了 怎么能让我看门呢
Oh, come off it. Watch a fucking door?

78
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,630
喜美子 要是布彻尔踏入电梯一步 你就拧断他的胳膊
Kimiko, if Butcher steps one foot in that elevator, break his arm.

79
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,470
请移除阻挡电梯门关闭的障碍物
Please remove obstruction from doors.

80
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,230
真他妈的
Fuck me.

81
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,570
来吧 儿子 我们去应酬一下
Okay, big man, let's do this.

82
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,580
里面有很多人
There's a lot of people in there.

83
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,000
得了吧 孩子
Come on, kiddo.

84
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:22,210
你会害怕一群蟑螂吗
Would you be scared of a bunch of cockroaches? Huh?

85
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:23,840
会
Yeah. 

86
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,470
小鸡之类的不会怕吧
Then baby chicks or whatever.

87
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:31,640
听着 重点是 你没有什么可紧张的
Look, the-the point is, you have nothing to be nervous about.

88
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,390
来吧 我们已经讨论过这件事了
Come on. We've talked about this.

89
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,310
他们只是人类 是...
They're only humans and...?

90
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,140
- 供我们娱乐的玩具 - 供我们娱乐的玩具
Toys for our amusement.

91
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,690
- 没错 - 是啊
- That's right. - Yeah.

92
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:41,980
我们能行
We got this.

93
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:58,790
等一下 我们遇到问题了
Hold up, hold up. Okay, we got a problem.

94
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,840
等等 他怎么来了
W-Wait, what is... he doing here?

95
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,960
祖国人在大楼里 如果你看到他 不要跟他交手
Homelander's in the building. If you see him, do not engage. 

96
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,010
我再说一遍 不要与祖国人交手
I repeat, do not engage with Homelander.

97
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:10,930
我说你呢 布彻尔 你听到了吗
That means you, Butcher, you copy?

98
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:14,260
天哪 你们今晚真漂亮 尤其是你
My goodness, you look beautiful this evening. Especially you. 

99
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:17,640
- 佐伊 你还记得我儿子莱恩吗  - 嗨
- Zoe, uh, y-you remember my son, Ryan? - Yeah. Hi.

100
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,560
嗨
Hi.

101
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,850
嘿 佐伊 知道吗
Hey, Zo, you know what? 

102
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:21,900
我听说这家酒店有自制冰淇淋
I heard that this hotel makes its own ice cream.

103
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,980
不如你带莱恩去尝尝吧
Why don't you take Ryan and try and find some, huh?

104
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:26,020
真是个好主意 快去吧 儿子
What a great idea. Go for it, sport.

105
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:28,990
回来时没人怀孕就好
Just nobody come back pregnant.

106
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,280
开个玩笑而已
Just kidding.

107
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,200
我在开玩笑呢 他们太年轻了
I'm kidding, I'm kidding. They're too young. Although,

108
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,580
不过 要是想要的话 莱恩还是能射出点精液的
Ryan could spew goo if he wanted to.

109
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,830
你他妈的有何贵干
What the fuck are you doing here?

110
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:43,040
过去16年里 每届新政府都获得了我的支持
Oh, I've supported every new administration for the past 16 years.

111
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,880
我不需要你的支持 你他妈的是个在审的杀人犯
I don't want your support. You're on trial for fucking murder.

112
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,920
嗨 道格
Hi, Doug.

113
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:51,840
第一 审判只是形式上的 第二 当时我明显是在自卫
One, that's a formality, and two, that's a clear-cut case of self-defense.

114
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:54,800
那个暴徒向我儿子投掷了一枚弹丸
That thug threw a projectile at my son.

115
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,390
是个塑料瓶而已
It was a plastic bottle.

116
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,850
里面可能有炭疽
Could've had anthrax in it.

117
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:00,810
并不是说这样会伤害我们 可这件事事关原则
Not that that would've hurt us, but there was a principle at stake.

118
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:03,560
另外 当我打倒那个禽兽时
And, besides, when I took that monster down, 

119
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,730
- 大家鼓掌了 - 你的股东们并没鼓掌
- people applauded. - Your shareholders didn't.

120
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:10,740
好吧 因此你我才要向他们证明
Well, that's why you and me are gonna prove to them

121
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,530
即便总统在犯罪行为面前软弱无能
that even with a "soft on crime" fucking libtard for a president...

122
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:17,910
沃特将对其打击到底 一如往常
...it's gonna be business as usual at Vought.

123
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:22,160
你我之间即便有过交易 那也是很久以前的事了
Any transaction you and I may or may not have had is ancient history.

124
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:31,300
那我们就来创造崭新的历史吧
Well, then let's make some new history.

125
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,340
女士们 先生们 维多利亚纽曼
Ladies and gentlemen, Victoria Neuman.

126
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:35,930
为她热烈鼓掌 好吗
Let's give her a round. Huh?

127
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:39,770
女孩们在白宫大行其道
Girls get it done in the White House.

128
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,140
天佑于你
God bless you.

129
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,290
让我们私下谈谈好吗 亲爱的
Give us a minute here, would you, love?

130
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,470
听着 莱恩 我有很多话要说
Listen, Ryan, I've got a lot to say...

131
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,310
但我时间有限
and fuck all time to say it.

132
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,890
我在后门准备了一辆卡车 可以带你离开这里
I got a lorry out back. I can get you out of here.

133
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,180
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

134
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,140
你生气了 你完全有权生气
I know you're angry at me, and you've got every right to be.

135
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:28,690
但你知道祖国人有多危险
But you know how dangerous Homelander is.

136
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:29,770
他是我爸
He's my dad.

137
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:32,360
莱恩 他当着你的面 谋杀了手无寸铁的人
Right. H-He murdered some poor sod right in front of your eyes.

138
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,030
没错 可那家伙是恋童癖
That guy was a pedophile.

139
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,820
才不是呢 祖国人在骗你
It ain't true. He-He's lying to you.

140
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:40,410
我带你去找格蕾丝吧 之后 你就不会再见到我了
Let me take you to Grace, all right? A-And then you don't got to see me no more.

141
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,210
拜托 我求你了
Please, I'm... I'm begging you.

142
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,540
你妈也会希望你这么做的
It's what your mom would want.

143
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,420
不就是不 威廉
No means no, William.

144
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,760
这里可不是梦幻庄园
This isn't the Neverland Ranch.

145
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,720
不用担心 不会有坏事发生
Don't worry. Nothing bad's gonna happen, 

146
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,760
对吗
right?

147
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,060
看来已经发生坏事了
Seems it already has.

148
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,940
看啊 你大脑里有个又大又黑的肿块
Look at that big black mass curdling around your brain.

149
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:14,860
你还有多久好活 六个月
What do you got, six months?

150
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,070
不到六个月
Less?

151
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,450
太糟糕了 我们没法一决雌雄了
That's too bad. W-We're not gonna have that last dance together.

152
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:23,870
我会想念我们的恩怨情仇
I'll miss us.

153
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:28,750
真他妈的 你那张臭嘴闭不上 是不是
Bloody hell. You wank to your own voice, don't you?

154
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,170
这才像你嘛 哥们儿
That's the spirit, champ.

155
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,380
儿子
Son.

156
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:45,680
快走吧
Come on. 

157
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,480
我可不想错过破嘴合唱团的演出
I do not want to miss Smash Mouth.

158
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,950
{\an9}? It ain't no joke ?

159
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:05,370
{\an9}? I'd like to buy the world a toke ?

160
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:07,750
{\an9}? And teach the world to sing in perfect harmony ?

161
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,420
{\an9}? And teach the world... ?

162
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,420
这么多裤装
So many pantsuits.

163
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,210
{\an9}? And the liars, hey, I know ?

164
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:15,000
{\an9}? It's just a song, but it's spice ?

165
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,010
{\an9}? For the recipe, this is a love attack ?

166
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,340
{\an9}? I know it went out, but it's back ?

167
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,010
{\an9}? It's just like any fad ?

168
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:24,300
{\an9}? It retracts before impact ?

169
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,810
{\an9}? And just like fashion, it's a passion for the ?

170
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:28,770
{\an9}? With-it and hip, if you got the goods ?

171
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:30,230
{\an9}? They'll come and buy it...

172
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:31,140
妈
Mom?

173
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,940
你们在这里做什么
What are you doing in here?

174
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:37,400
抱歉 纽曼小姐 我们负责你母亲的保安工作
Apologies, Miss Neuman,

175
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,440
- 我们正在进行安全检查 - 那是佐伊吗
- we're with your mother's detail. - Is that Zoe?

176
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,150
我们马上就好
We'll be done in just a minute.

177
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,120
不如你在外面等一下吧
Why don't you wait outside.

178
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,250
- 法兰奇 怎么回事  - 她是个超人类
- Frenchie, what's happening? - She's a fucking Supe.

179
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,250
她是个超人类
She's a fucking Supe!

180
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,720
我看我就...
Yeah, I guess I'll just, uh...

181
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,090
在这等着吧
...wait here.

182
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:09,850
没关系
It's okay.

183
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:11,560
我们什么都没看见
We see nothing.

184
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:32,000
我们得出去 快
We need an exit, now!

185
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,170
走廊南端有扇窗户
There's a window on the south end of the hallway.

186
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,470
这可是八层楼啊
Uh... We're eight stories up.

187
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,390
法兰奇 相信我
Frenchie, trust me.

188
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,380
小心
- No! - Frenchie!

189
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,800
该死
Motherfucker.

190
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,060
好
Yes.

191
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,520
妈的
- Oh, shit. - Oh, mon Dieu.

192
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,440
天哪
Oh, God.

193
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,650
太恶心了
Oh, gross.

194
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,250
谢天谢地 现在能走了吗 天哪
Thank Christ. Can we go now? Jesus.

195
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,290
- 嘿 休伊 - 嘿
- Hey, you. - Hey.

196
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:02,550
教教布彻尔什么叫“隐秘行动” 他刚被一个12岁的孩子识破了
You got to teach Butcher the meaning of the word "covert." He just got made by a 12-year-old.

197
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,300
你是说佐伊吗 她杀了两个人
You mean Zoe, who just murdered two guys?

198
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:08,260
维可 你给自己的女儿注射了五号  你怎么能这样对她
Vic, you-you shot your own daughter up with V? How could you do that to her?

199
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,180
- 我需要保证她的安全 - 安全
- I needed to keep her safe. - Safe?

200
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,560
你他妈的把她变成了一个怪物
You turned her into a fucking monster. 

201
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,390
你这种怪物
Like you.

202
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:15,850
有没有搞错 你居然指责我
I'm sorry. That sounds like the pot calling the kettle

203
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:18,650
是谁露着鸡巴瞬间转移来着
a teleporting dude with his dick out.

204
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,270
那是我犯下的弥天大错
Worst mistake I ever made.

205
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,110
维可 我和你 我们以前...
Vic, you and me, we were...

206
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:27,950
我们以前就像家人一样
We were like family. I mean...

207
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,950
难道那时的一切都是假的吗
was everything just... bullshit?

208
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:36,000
有一次我差点就告诉你了
I almost told you once.

209
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,210
你还记得吗 那天晚上停电了
That night of the blackout, you remember?

210
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,840
你给佐伊带来了好多零食
You brought every bodega snack you could carry for Zoe.

211
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,210
我们跟她玩了几个小时的优诺牌 一直玩到电力恢复
We played Uno with her for hours until the lights came back on.

212
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:47,760
我当时想
And I thought...

213
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,970
你是我最亲密的朋友之一
...you were one of my closest friends.

214
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:54,220
你的约会对象不也是个超人类吗
I mean, hell, you're dating a Supe.

215
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,640
如果你都不能理解 还有谁能理解呢 对吧
If anyone would understand, it'd be you, right?

216
00:14:58,350 --> 00:14:59,770
那你为什么没告诉我
Why didn't you tell me?

217
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:03,230
- 我很害怕 - 害怕你不得不爆掉我的头
- I was scared. - Scared you'd have to pop my head.

218
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,770
我害怕失去你
I was scared to lose you.

219
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:12,410
我一直都很在乎你 休伊
I always cared about you, Hughie.

220
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,240
那种在乎是真心的
That part was real.

221
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,040
嘿 维琪
Hey, Vicky.

222
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,040
去你妈的
Fuck you!

223
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:29,800
搞什么
Seriously?

224
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:34,760
我十分钟后得上电视 你个混蛋
I have to be on TV in, like, ten minutes, you fucking asshole.

225
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,640
我们会曝光你 我们会去找媒体 告诉他们是你炸毁了国会
We're gonna out you. We're gonna go to the press, tell them you blew up Congress.

226
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,480
- 我还有红河之家的档案 - 你看过《战争游戏》吗
- I still, I still got the Red River files. - Okay, okay, okay. Have you ever seen WarGames?

227
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,690
我真是在说废话 你肯定看过
What am I saying, look at you, of course you've seen fucking WarGames.

228
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:45,360
- 你居然还在开玩笑  - 两雄相争 必然双亡
- We're making jokes? - Mutually assured destruction.

229
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,740
我伤害了你 你曝光我 你曝光了我 我就会杀掉所有你爱的人
I hurt you, you out me. You out me, I kill everyone you've ever loved.

230
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,660
只有休战才行得通
The only thing that makes sense is a truce.

231
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:56,410
或许备用计划也行得通
Or plan B.

232
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,580
天哪 妈的
Jesus fucking...

233
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,040
你们的工作怎么干得越来越差劲了
How is it you guys are actually getting worse at your jobs?

234
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:13,550
亚利桑那州的选举结果出炉了
They just called Arizona.

235
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:16,680
看来我得去换套衣服
Guess I better go change.

236
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,990

苏珊瑞尼副主任

240
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,580
我们的今天得益于她

241
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,450
你能来 我真高兴 你到底去哪儿了
Nice of you to show up. Where the hell you been?

242
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,000
盥洗室

243
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,170
昨晚因你轻敌而导致的失败 散发着恶臭 我得洗掉它
The bog. Trying to wash off the stench of failure from your cock-up last night.

244
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:47,960
你他妈闭嘴吧 布奇
Shut the fuck up, Butcher.

245
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,630
格蕾丝
Grace.

246
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,800
- 你不能进来 - 少来
- Not you. - Oh, come off it.

247
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,930
我都洗心革面了 M 帮我说句话
I washed my bollocks and all. M? 

248
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:02,180
某些人
There are people who,

249
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,600
也许出于无知 也许出于疯狂
because of ignorance or maybe insanity,

250
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,020
仍然相信你会有所贡献
still believe you have something to contribute.

251
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,020
我才不信呢
I'm not one of them.

252
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:12,070
我会把孩子带回来的 格蕾丝
I'll get the kid back, Grace.

253
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:13,450
我会弥补的
I'll make it right.

254
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:23,580
负责我保安的两名特工 死于一名12岁少年之手
Two agents from my detail are dead at the hands of a 12-year-old.

255
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:28,210
我们只好告知其家属在余兴派对上 他们吸食了含有芬太尼的可卡因
We had to tell their families they snorted fentanyl-laced cocaine at the after-party.

256
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:31,550
长官 我方情报表明 那种酸对纽曼有效
- Sir, our intel told us the acid would work on Neuman. - She's no idiot.

257
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,920
她不是白痴 她会知道我是幕后主使
She'll know I was behind it.

258
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,680
妈的 人人都告诉我选择布蒂吉格
Goddamn it! Everyone told me to pick Buttigieg instead.

259
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,890
您事先不知情嘛 先生
You didn't know, sir. Marvin,

260
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:42,020
马文 我给你打了包票 中情局会为你提供资金...
I vouched for you. The CIA is bankrolling you.

261
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,270
无意冒犯 长官
All due respect, ma'am,

262
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:46,520
但您可以随时让布彻尔重新负责 他就在外面
you can always put Butcher back in charge. He's right outside.

263
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,480
- 星光呢  - 她现在叫安妮了
- What about Starlight? - She goes by Annie now.

264
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,730
安妮能晃瞎纽曼的眼睛 削弱她的超能力吗
Can Annie burn out Neuman's fucking eyes, debilitate her?

265
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:54,860
近距离才可以 但那么近的话 安妮也肯定人头不保了
If she can get close enough to her without getting her head popped off, who knows?

266
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,860
但我们可能得被迫接受这种可能性
But we might have to accept the possibility 

267
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,870
那就是纽曼是无懈可击的
that Neuman's... invulnerable.

00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:01,830
1月6日国会就批准选举结果了

269
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:05,710
此后 超人类距离总统职位 仅一步之遥
After that, a Supe is one heartbeat away from the presidency.

270
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,710
真他妈的
My fucking heartbeat.

271
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:11,290
我不久就要与其共事
Now, I can only keep my distance from her for so long.

272
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:15,090
- 消灭她是首要任务 - 他妈的好好完成任务
- Eliminating her is top priority. - So do your fucking job.

273
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:16,420
是 长官
Yes, ma'am.

274
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,220
他妈的
Fuck.

275
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,720
莫妮克

276
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,270
你需要去其他地方吗
Somewhere else you need to be?

277
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,230
不需要 长官
No, sir.

278
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:30,980
如果不清楚的话 我没有..

279
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:33,190
比利布彻尔
Billy Butcher.

280
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,400
乔凯斯勒 他妈的 我们多久没见了
Joe Kessler. Fuck me. How long's it been?

281
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,990
我觉得有11年了 但正式的见面 其实从来没有过
Uh, I'd say 11 years, but, officially speaking, none of that shit show ever happened.

282
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:46,410
那我怎么记得你吸食鸦片后 飘飘欲仙地去勾引将军夫人
Then how come I remember you high on opium, rimming out the General's wife?

283
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:47,460
去你妈的
Well, fuck you.

284
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,840
嘿 我给你买一杯难喝的咖啡吧
Hey, let me buy you a bad cup of coffee.

285
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:57,800
你自己组建的团队 居然还能降职  你那支团队叫什么鬼名字来着
Demoted from your own fucking team. What's your shitty code name again?

286
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,880
英雄克星
The Boys.

287
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,680
这么烂的名字是谁想出来的
Oof. Who came up with that shit?

288
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:05,270
为什么委曲求全呢 可以走人嘛
Why you putting up with it? Walk away.

289
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:08,180
不 哥们儿 我有计划 有谋划
No, my son, I've got plans and schemes.

290
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:11,100
我很快就会重获领导岗位
I'll be back at the head of the table in no time.

291
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,150
事不宜迟啊
Well, you better.

292
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,820
很多人都觉得
You know, a lot of the guys are thinking you got benched

293
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,030
你丢掉领导岗位的时机 最糟糕不过了
at the worst possible time.

294
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:20,410
马洛里一心想要杀死当选的副总统
You know, Mallory's so focused on killing the VP-Elect

295
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:23,410
因为辛格尔想要她死 中情局的一半人马都在执行这项任务
'cause that's what Singer wants, and half of goddamn Langley's on it.

296
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:24,580
你是了解格蕾丝的
Well, you know Grace, 

297
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,540
她一直有点痴迷于政治
she's always been a bit of a political animal.

298
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,370
那你关注的是什么
And what are you focused on?

299
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,250
祖国人
Homelander.

300
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,380
他在光天化日之下 杀了那个可怜的家伙
He killed that poor cunt in broad daylight, 

301
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,750
人们却欢呼雀跃
and they fucking cheered.

302
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:37,710
你觉得这事让他得到了什么教训
I mean, what you think that taught him, eh?

303
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,760
没有教训
No.

304
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,600
世界末日即将降临 我们却还吹着口哨欢庆
We're whistling away towards a fucking apocalypse,

305
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,890
格蕾丝并没有专注于完成任务
and Grace's eye ain't on the ball.

306
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:48,730
但那时你完全有机会干掉他 对吧
You had a clean shot at him, right?

307
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,690
跟士兵男孩一起进攻的那次
With Soldier Boy? 

308
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,100
你却没有动手
You didn't take it.

309
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,980
你专注于完成任务了吗
Was your eye on the ball?

310
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:00,700
为什么我感觉我们并不是偶遇
Why do I get the feeling we ain't just bumped into each other?

311
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,740
你还记得潘杰希尔山谷吗
You remember the Panjshir Valley?

312
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:05,490
记得
Yeah. 

313
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:08,040
算得上刻苦铭心吧
Pretty hard to forget.

314
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,290
为了把我救出去 你只好把很多战友的尸体留在那里
You dragged me out of there and dropped how many bodies to do it,

315
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:13,500
没有一丝犹豫
without giving it a second fucking thought.

316
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,840
我对你有救命之恩 你给儿子起名时 居然没用我的名字
And yet you still didn't name your son after me, eh?

317
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,090
我们需要像你这样的人 比利
We need someone like you, Billy. 

318
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,170
现在就需要
Right fucking now.

319
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:25,050
超人类很快就要开始围捕我们 把我们投入集中营了
Before the Supes start rounding us up and dumping us off in camps.

320
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,980
- 嘿 - 领带 你要去参加舞会吗
- Hey. - A tie? You going to prom?

321
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,400
- 怎么了  - 珍妮
- What's up? - Janine.

322
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,370
她在学校打架了
She got into a fight at school.

323
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,330
校长没有说为什么 只是说她打倒了一个男孩
Principal didn't say why, just that she KO'd a boy.

324
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:50,450
一个男孩
A boy?

325
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,410
没什么好骄傲的
Don't you dare be proud right now.

326
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:55,170
她脾气大着呢 马文
She's been slamming doors, Marvin.

327
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,420
她让我...
She told me 

328
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,670
“滚一边去”
to "eat a dick."

329
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:00,300
珍妮居然说了这种话
Janine said that?

330
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,840
托德搬出去后 她一直都很难过
She's been having a hard time since Todd moved out.

331
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,430
你是说你把他赶出去之后
You mean, since you kicked him out?

332
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,510
你别太得意了
Let's dial down the glee in your voice, 

333
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:11,640
不过 确实 是我赶他走的 但珍妮仍然爱他
but, yes, since I kicked him out. But Janine still loves him.

334
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,690
- 她很担心 - 担心什么
- She's worried. - Worried about what?

335
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:17,940
托德对祖国人莫名地痴迷崇拜
Todd got so deep into all that weird Hometeamer shit.

336
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,230
他不接我的电话
He's not answering my calls. 

337
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:21,150
- 我不知道他在哪里 - 所以呢
- I don't know where he is. - Okay, so...?

338
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:22,740
你很擅长找人 不如...
And you're good at finding people.

339
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,160
- 拜托 莫妮克 - 为了你女儿嘛 马文
- Oh, come on. Monique-- - For your daughter, Marvin.

340
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,120
我明白你看上那家伙哪一点
Well, I get what you saw in that guy. 

341
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,420
他对珍妮很好
He was good to Janine.

342
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,040
肯定不是看上他的床上功夫
'Cause it sure as shit wasn't the D.

343
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:46,050
对吧
Right?

344
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,890
- 你一定要乖 - 你是我最大的失败
You have to be good. 

345
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:52,560
你只是...糟糕的产品
You're my greatest failure.

346
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:54,980
这是你的宿命
It's your destiny.

347
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,560
不过是个房间罢了

348
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,270
求妈妈 求爸爸的你 那个哭哭啼啼的你

349
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,280
因为在你的内心深处
It's because deep down there's a part 

350
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,200
- 依然有一部分是人类 - 不是
of you that is still...human.

351
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,590
别跟我胡言乱语
Don't get brazen with me.

352
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:23,340
不可称死者为“受害者”
You're not to refer to the deceased as the "victim."

353
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,840
这样说有诱导性 他是否是受害者将由陪审团决定
It's a loaded term and for the jury to decide.

354
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,890
先生 沃特塔的重建工作 恐怕没有跟上进度
Sir, so I'm afraid we are behind on the Tower Reconstruction,

355
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:33,180
但我可以向您保证 这不是我的错
but I can 100% assure you that it is not my fault.

356
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:35,220
直到安妮詹纽艾瑞
But it wasn't until Annie January stepped out

357
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,640
离开沃特 摆脱祖国人的控制
from Vought's shadow, and Homelander's,

358
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,560
突发新闻 纽约爱安妮詹纽艾瑞

359
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,650
我们才看到了她的真正力量
that we saw the true extent of her power.

360
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,570
沃特和祖国人并不凌驾于法律之上
Vought and Homelander aren't above the law.

361
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:45,360
他们不能为所欲为
They can't just do whatever they want.

362
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:49,030
深海 我们得谈谈房间里的那只章鱼
Deep, we got to talk about the octopus in the room.

363
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:49,950
《与海莉米勒面对面》

364
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:52,280
你前妻卡桑德拉 写了本揭露真相的书...
Your ex, Cassandra, wrote a tell-all book--

365
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,240
我得打断你一下 海莉
I'm gonna have to stop you right there, Hailey.

366
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,750
跟章鱼没有任何关系
You know, there were no relations with an octopus.

367
00:22:56,750 --> 00:23:01,000
这只是一个被抛弃的 情绪不稳定 歇斯底里的女人
It's, uh, it's just a racist rumor and a ridiculous lie perpetuated by a jilted and, uh... 

368
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,300
咬住不放的 种族主义谣言和可笑的谎言
emotionally unstable hysterical woman,

369
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,050
澄清一下 这个女人在玷污我的清誉
who, let's be clear, pooped in my bed.

370
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:10,840
深海 那只该死的章鱼被你搞定了吧
Deep, please tell me the fucking octopus is gone.

371
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,970
是的 艾诗丽 她...
Yes, Ashley. She's...

372
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:16,430
它被搞定了 好吗
It is taken care of. Okay?

373
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,310
嘿 玄色
Hey, Noir.

374
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:23,020
先生 再次感谢您的救命之恩 经历了戈多尔金大学灾难之后
Sir, after that debacle at Godolkin-- thank you again for saving my life--

375
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:26,530
董事会认为我们应该 尽快为超级七人队找到新的候选人
the board felt we should find new candidates for The Seven, ASAP.

376
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:30,320
选拔委员会已确定了25名人选
The selection committee has narrowed it down to 25 choices.

377
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,790
很好 如果单纯考虑社交媒体影响力
Um, okay, great.

378
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,910
我可能会推荐来自雷德兰兹的塔隆
If we're going purely on socials, I might suggest Talon out of Redlands.

379
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:42,500
不行 她的脸蛋不漂亮
Pass. She's a butterface.

380
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,630
- 身材很好 但脸... - 我懂
- Her body's on point, but her face... - Yeah, I get it.

381
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:47,880
非常感谢你的解释
Thank you so much for explaining.

382
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,470
沙文主义混蛋
Chauvinist prick.

383
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,590
许珀里翁

384
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:52,340
这种荡妇可不行
Ugh, not that slutty cum rag.

385
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:53,470
犬人诺特

386
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:56,260
- 等等 他不是吃了一只狗吗  - 他吃光了一只狗
- Hold up, I thought he ate a dog. - He ate out a dog.

387
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,850
区别大着呢
It's a big difference.

388
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,940
智者姐妹 绝对不行
Sister Sage? Hell no.

389
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:07,780
我们是英雄少年队的队友 不到一年 她就被除名了
She was with me in Teenage Kix for, like, barely a year before they canned her ass. 

390
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,900
- 她有什么超能力  - 她是“世界上最聪明的人”
- What's her power? - She's the world's smartest person.

391
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:13,490
她还不够聪明 因为她不知道什么时候该闭嘴
She's not smart enough to know when to shut her mouth.

392
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:15,910
- 牧马人 他是... - 德克萨斯疯子
- Wrangler. Isn't he a... - Texas nutjob. 

393
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:18,790
圣安东尼奥办事处必须掩盖 他犯下的移民谋杀案
The San Antonio office had to cover up those migrant murders.

394
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,450
- 我有点喜欢他 - 当然
- I kind of like him. - Of course,

395
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:23,210
他帮我们吸引 郊区妇女和50岁以上的白人男性
he bumps us with suburban women and white men over 50.

396
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:24,960
先生 选得好
Amazing choice, sir.

397
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,170
我完全同意 他是个好人 这个词我用得对吗
Yeah, I totally agree. He's a mensch. Did I use that word right? Mensch?

398
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:29,550
你刚才还说他是疯子来着

and he's gonna make sure you spend the next four years

477
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:43,900
- 用这件事来要挟你 - 我想我自己能搞定
- grabbing your ankles while he shoves it up your ass. - I think I can handle myself.

00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,450
靠他们在戈多尔金大学 炮制的邪恶病毒吗
Oh, you mean that nasty little virus they cooked you up at Godolkin?

是的 我知道这件事
Yeah, I know about it,

480
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:54,410
我还知道它还不足以杀死祖国人
and I know it ain't strong enough to kill Homelander yet.

00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:57,170

That don't stop him from going to the press.

488
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:21,940
但能阻止媒体发表这些资料
Mm. Stops them from printing it.

489
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:26,610

The Starlight House, a so-called "home for at-risk teens."

509
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:38,850
当然 杰夫爱泼斯坦自杀了
Sure. And Jeff Epstein killed himself.

510
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:41,850
这些青少年唯一面临的风险是
No, the only thing these teens are at risk of is being groomed

511
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:46,730
被打扮得清爽透亮 被投进星光的 性少数群体恐怖地牢
and thrown into Starlight's LGBTerror-dungeon.

512
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:48,740
儿童的生命很重要 伙计们
Child Lives Matter, folks...

513
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,990
你在场的话 更容易获得媒体报道
It'd be a lot easier to get media coverage if you were there.

514
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:56,080
祖国人的判决结果肯定是无罪
Homelander's verdict will 1,000% be innocent,

515
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,450
我在场就会给那件事增添光彩 我才不去呢
and I'm not showing up to even dignify that shit.

516
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:01,920

Annie, I'm happy to organize the protest and-and make the speech,

517
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,630
但没有人想听
but no one wants to hear it

518
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:06,380
因为这是星光运动 可我不是星光
'cause it's the Starlighter Movement and I'm not Starlight.

519
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,630
我也不是呀
Well, neither am I.

520
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:08,920
那这又是谁
Then, tell that to her.

521
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:14,300
我辞职就是为了不再当星光
The whole reason I quit was to get away from her.

522
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:17,770
现在 你组织的星光活动棒极了 你不需要我
Now, you're killing it with the Starlighters. You don't need me.

523
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:20,730
如果...只是说如果你是星光
If-- just if-- you were Starlight,

524
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:23,730
也许我们会筹集一些真正的捐款
then maybe we'd drum up some real donations.

525
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:28,230
我当然想帮忙 但要以安妮詹纽艾瑞的身份
I want to help, of course, but as Annie January.

526
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:31,490
没有人给安妮之家捐款 这名字听着像卖葡萄干饼干的组织
No one's donating to the Annie House. It sounds like we sell raisin cookies.

527
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:32,490
星光之家 为危难青少年提供安全空间

嘿 科林很讨人厌
Hey. So, Colin is annoying as hell,

529
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:40,500
但在过去的几个月里
but he has saved my ass more than a few times

530
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,910
他救了我很多次
over the past few months, 

531
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:44,500
所以 谢谢你的推荐 他很棒
so thank you for the rec. He's a champ.

532
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:49,090
第一次戒瘾小组会议上 我就看出他能行了
Oh, je t'en prie. You know, I can tell this even from our first group meeting.

533
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:53,180
匿名会议 所以还是别提的好
Anonymous meetings. Right there in the name.

534
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:18,120
我不应该提起我们的戒瘾会议
I should not have brought up our meetings.

535
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:21,450
没关系 我很想让我的老板 知道我以前吸过毒
It's okay. I love my boss knowing I'm an ex-junkie.

536
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,680
稍后再聊

537
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:34,990
维特根斯坦的基本方法 很可能令人难以置信

538
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:37,860
其中一个领域就是数学规则的概念

539
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:41,660
另一领域是我们谈论自我的内心体验 谈论感觉

540
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:44,330
处理这两种情况时 我们应该记住...

541
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:57,220
这次我还真是被惊到了呢
I am almost never surprised.

542
00:34:58,590 --> 00:34:59,640
我可以进去吗
May I come in?

543
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:07,390
智者姐妹
Sister Sage.

544
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:08,600
叫智者就好
Just Sage.

545
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,600
好吧
Right.

546
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:13,320
“姐妹”是沃特加的
Vought added the "Sister" part.

547
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,530
必须给我们加个种族限定词才行
Can't have one of us without a racial qualifier.

548
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:19,740
从来没见过不穿战衣的你 为什么要微服私访
Never seen you without the suit. Why incognito?

549
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:23,660
我本以为地球上最聪明的女人 会住在一个更有品位的地方
You know, I would've thought the smartest woman on Earth would have a nicer place.

550
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:24,950
最聪明的人
Smartest person,

551
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:28,210
那个人太聪明了 根本不在乎什么家居产品
and that person's too smart to give a fuck about Pottery Barn.

552
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:31,670
说得好 姐妹 那个...
Okay. Preach, sister. Well, um...

553
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,300
你那么聪明
You're so smart.

554
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:37,010
展示给我看
Show me.

555
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:40,090
展示给我看
Show me.

556
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,890
根据你公开露面的情况
Based on your public appearances,

557
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:48,560
你的造型师在更频繁地给你染发
your stylist is dying your hair more often.

558
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,890
以前是每月一次 现在是每2.4周一次
Used to be every month, now it's every 2.4 weeks.

559
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:53,560
她有没有告诉过你 你的头发白了 还是她隐瞒没说
Did she tell you you're going gray, or is she hiding it?

560
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:56,230
除此之外 你的前列腺肥大...
So between that and your enlarged prostate...

561
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:57,190
你他妈的说什么
My fucking what?

562
00:35:57,190 --> 00:36:00,280
看看你的手 你洗手洗得更频繁了
Look at your hands. You've been washing them more often,

563
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:03,030
很可能你撒尿的次数更频繁了 这是说得通的
so likely you've been peeing more often, which makes sense.

564
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:05,950
你拥有很多超能力 但你确实在变老
You got a lot of power, but you do age.

565
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:11,330
另外 还有一件小事 你的父亲差点杀了你 所以...
Plus, there's that small matter your own father almost killed you.

566
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:12,460
哇
Wow.

567
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:16,210
任何人都看得出来
Any mouth breather could see 

568
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:18,920
你正在经历中年生存危机...
you're going through some existential midlife...

569
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,260
无所谓啦
whatever.

570
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:24,300
对于一个超能力仅供娱乐的人来说 你说出这些话是相当大胆
Pretty ballsy for someone whose power is a party trick.

571
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,470
你想用激光杀死我的话 动手好了
You are welcome to laser me,

572
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:29,270
但我猜你需要我仅供娱乐的超能力 来达到某种目的
but I'm guessing you need me and my party trick for something.

573
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,100
我需要建议
I need advice.

574
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,270
需要与我水平相当的人给我建议
From someone on my level.

575
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:42,360
当然 你若对此透露只言片语 我会一点一点地把你撕碎
Of course, if you breathe a word of this, I'll pull you apart bit by bit.

576
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,450
当然
Naturally.

577
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:48,290
天哪 我一生都想爬上 沃特这座山峰的顶端
God, I've spent my life scaling to the peak of-of Vought.

578
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:52,540
那是我唯一的目标 现在我已经实现了这个目标...
It's all I ever wanted. And-and... now that I have it--

579
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,960
仍然不开心吗
You're still not happy?

580
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:59,050
我救了人 他们欢呼
I save people, they cheer. 

581
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,260
我他妈的杀人 他们也欢呼
I fucking kill people, they cheer.

582
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,630
我的作为毫无意义
It's-it's meaningless.

583
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:08,890
人类是狗屁 比狗屁还不如
Humans are nothing. They're, they're less than nothing.

584
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:12,430
他们只是供我娱乐的玩具
They're just toys for my amusement.

585
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:14,230
然而他们控制着一切
And yet they control everything.

586
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:15,650
这是不符合自然规律的
It's unnatural.

587
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:19,320
我儿子会从我手上继承什么
What kind of legacy am-am I gonna leave to my son?

588
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:23,070
狗屎世界上的狗屎国家  还是更好的东西
A shithole country in a shithole world? Or something better?

589
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:24,320
某种...
Something... 

590
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:28,370
纯粹而洁净的东西 就像...
pure and cleansed. Like... 

591
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:31,120
大理石
marble.

592
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:35,000
实现了可能也不会让你快乐 你意识到这一点了吧
You do realize that probably won't make you happy, either.

593
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,590
可我仍然想实现它 告诉我你会怎么做
Still. Tell me how you'd go about it.

594
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,550
假设是你的话
Hypothetically.

595
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:46,590
罗马 希腊
Well... Greece,

596
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:51,430
所有民主国家都失败了 因为大众太愚蠢了
all democracies, they fail because people are fucking stupid.

597
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:57,730
你不需要像新纳粹分子一样 组建超人类军队 太像德国人了
You don't need an army of Supermen like Nazi bae wanted-- so German.

598
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:03,940
如果你压垮了群众 谁来为你建造纪念碑
If you crush the masses, who builds your monuments?

599
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:05,740
谁来给你拍马屁
Who tongues your taint?

600
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:10,450
不 大众会自我毁灭
No. The people will tear it apart themselves,

601
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:12,870
你只需要略微怂恿他们一下
just got to nudge 'em a little.

602
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:17,080
然后你就可以猛扑上去 成为人们的救星
Then you get to swoop in, be the one saving it.

603
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:21,670
就像凯撒一样
Like Caesar.

604
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:24,760
从统计学上看 一定能成功
Statistically, it's inevitable.

605
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:39,400
- 我希望你加入超级七人队 - 绝对不行
- I'd like you to join the Seven. - No fucking way.

606
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,480
为什么
Why not?

607
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,570
因为我才不要在一群拍手的海豹面前 穿着某种
Because I'm not wearing some vaguely racist super suit in front 

608
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:45,440
隐约带有种族主义色彩的超级战衣
of a bunch of clapping seals.

609
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:49,360
另外 我这样的黑人女性 比你聪明一千倍
Plus, I'm a Black woman who is a thousand times smarter than you.

610
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,780
这会伤害你的自尊
Your ego can't handle it.

611
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,990
我自己也很聪明
I'm pretty smart myself. 

612
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:55,870
- 瞧见了吧  - 聪明到善于倾听
- See what I mean? - Smart enough to listen.

613
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:00,250
我是说听从你的建议
I mean really listen to you.

614
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:05,670
你可以留在这里 吃着塔可钟外卖 在孤独中过活
You can stay here, reeking of Taco Bell and loneliness,

615
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,840
或者我们可以将你的某些理论 在全球范围内付诸实践
or we can put some of your theories into practice on a global scale.

616
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:15,100
你等待这样的机会 等了多久了
When's the last time you got a chance like that?

617
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:27,320
- 布彻尔 你在这儿做什么  - 睡不着
- Butcher, what are you doing here? - Couldn't sleep.

618
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:32,030
你呢
What about you?

619
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,620
我爸爸 他...他中风了
Um, my dad, he, uh, he had a stroke.

620
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:38,000
真他妈的 我对此深感遗憾 伙计
Oh, fuck. I'm sorry to hear that, mate.

621
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,330
我拿上一些东西就回医院去陪他
Just gonna grab a few things before I get back to him.

622
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:43,670
- 他... - 我不知道
- Is he, uh... - I-I don't know.

623
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,510
中风前 他给我打了电话
He-he called me right before it happened, 

624
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,430
可是
and, um... 

625
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:53,220
我没接
I didn't pick up.

626
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:56,520
我为什么不接呢
Why didn't I pick up?

627
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,680
接了的话 也许我可以 预见到他会中风 可以...
I mean, maybe I could've seen it coming. I could-- I could've... 

628
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:01,020
休伊 别为此自责
No, no, no. Hughie. Don't beat yourself up about it. 

629
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,560
你对此无能为力
There's nothing you could've done.

630
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:06,530
他只想聊聊詹姆斯帕特森的蠢书
All he ever wants is to chat about some stupid fucking James Patterson book

631
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:08,650
他正在读那些书 但我没能做到
that he's reading, and I couldn't even give him that.

632
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:11,070
现在 医院说即使他会活下来...
And now they're saying that even if he lives...

633
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,450
是的
God.

634
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:16,990
我很清楚我会想要什么
Yeah, well, I know what I'd want.

635
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:20,080
好死胜过赖活着
Quick lights out. Better than the alternative.

636
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:23,290
可别坐着沉浸在自己的错误中
Sitting there, stewing in your mistakes...

637
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,670
等着死亡不可避免地降临
...as you wait out the inevitable.

638
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,610
希望你爸能挺过去
I hope your old man pulls through.

639
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:51,110
谢谢 我...
Thank you. I-- 

640
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:57,410
- 休伊  - 嘿
Hughie? - Hey.

641
00:40:57,410 --> 00:40:59,330
我深表遗憾
I'm so sorry.

642
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:02,910
我尽快赶来了 我很遗憾
I got here as soon as I could. I'm sorry.

643
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,500
我没事
I'm okay.

644
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:18,050
比利乔

645
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:25,850
- 在这里转弯 - 这里吗
- Turn here. - Right here? 

646
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:30,280
是的 中央情报局 如何看待你浪费其大量资源
Yes. So, what does the CIA think of you wasting their vast resources,

647
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,570
追查托德的手机
all to hunt down the phone of Todd?

648
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:36,820
我没有问 我也没有叫你来啊
I didn't ask. Just like I didn't ask you to come, either.

649
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:39,370
我们永远支持你 我的朋友
We are here for you always, mon ami.

650
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,620
科林 多媒体短信服务图像

651
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:49,920
科林
Colin?

652
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:53,760
你问这个干什么
Why do you ask?

653
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,760
你们在卫生间里
You've been spending a lot of time...

654
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,050
待了很长时间
...together in the bathroom...

655
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:02,520
抱歉 我应该解释一下的
Sorry, I should've said something.

656
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,980
但这事很复杂
But it's complicated.

657
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,940
需要明确的是
To be clear

658
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:14,490
我爱你
I love you.

659
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:18,450
但我和你
But you and I...

660
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:20,450
不可能发生关系
Are not happening.

661
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:21,790
我知道
I know.

662
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:25,580
所以 如果科林让你开心
So if Colin makes you happy...

663
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:28,790
那就去享受快乐吧
Go be happy.

664
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:32,340
喂 找到他了
Yo, white boy spotted.

665
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:49,150
- 怎么样  - 很好 谢谢
How's it going, Nick? 

666
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:50,690
- 在这排队等着会见  - 是的
- Here for the meet-up? - Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

667
00:42:50,690 --> 00:42:51,770
酷
Cool.

668
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,990
- 问得好 - 问的什么
- That's a good question. - What's that? 

669
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:02,450
她想知道莫妮克这样的好女人
She wonders, uh... how a man such as this win the love of a woman

670
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:05,120
怎么会爱上他这样的男人
like Monique, you know?

671
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,080
他...他对我女儿很好
Oh, he's, uh, he's nice to my daughter.

672
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,620
拜托 只有一个原因
Come on, there is only one reason.

673
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:12,460
托德肯定床上功夫了得
Todd must be packing some serious heat between his legs.

674
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:14,750
说真的 法兰奇 用不着你来
Seriously, Frenchie, you did not have to come.

675
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:16,050
我只是想说
Okay, I'm only saying,

676
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:20,390
他很像皮特戴维森 不是吗
the man has some serious Pete Davidson energy over there, no?

677
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:26,930
你认得她吗
You recognize her?

678
00:43:26,930 --> 00:43:28,140
我不确定
Not sure.

679
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:30,940
嗨 伙计们 感谢你们这么快就赶来了
Hi, fellas. Thanks for making it on such short notice.

680
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:34,230
他在这里 对吗 在这座大楼里
He's here, right? Like, in the building here?

681
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:37,740
今天是我这辈子最美好的一天
This is the best day of my life.

682
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:40,410
好吧 我们走吧
Yeah.

683
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:47,700
知道嘛 德克 实际上 在水下时 我并没有屏住呼吸
Well, you know, Dirk, I'm not actually holding my breath underwater.

684
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,460
严格说来 在水下时 我是呼吸的
I'm technically breathing underwater.

685
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,370
所以就更了不起了
So it's more impressive.

686
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:54,750
火车头 尝尝布法罗辣酱培根卷 鲜嫩多汁
A-Train, try these buffalo ranch bacon blasters. They're juicy.

687
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:55,840

很高兴再次见到你
It's good to see you again.

689

你怎么来了
What the fuck are you doing here?

690
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:03,220
周围都是白痴 让祖国人感到厌倦
Homelander's tired of being surrounded by morons.

691
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,390
大家好
Hello, everyone. 

692
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:10,020
祖国人 我只想说 和你见面是我莫大的荣幸
Homelander! I just want to say, it's a huge honor to be here with you.

693
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:11,640
好 我不能久留
Right. Now, I can't stay long,

694
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:15,400
但我听说你们是我的铁杆粉丝
but I heard that you are some of my biggest fans,

695
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,860
其他人背弃我时 你们却支持我
supporting me when others turned their backs.

696
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:19,780
我只想当面说一句
I just wanted to personally say...

697
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:23,160
感谢你们的奉献
thank you for your devotion 

698
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:25,660
和牺牲
and your sacrifice.

699
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:30,620
实际上 是你付出了那么多...
W-- Well, really, it's you who gives so much to--

700
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:33,790
你们不仅是粉丝
You people are more than just fans.

701
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:37,710
还是地球上最伟大事业的烈士
You're martyrs to the greatest cause on Earth.

702
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:38,630
把包打开
Open it.

703
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:39,760
好
You got it.

704
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:44,840
球棍
Whoa. Bats.

705
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:46,640
是的
Yeah.

706
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:50,480
我要你们用这些球棍
I want you to take these bats

707
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:53,060
将几位先生活活打死
and beat these gentlemen to death.

708
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:04,910
你真幽默
You're funny.

709
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:08,280
这是你的测试吧 你想让我们拒绝
Oh, it's like one of your tests. You want us to say no.

710
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:11,700
不 深海 这不是什么测试
No, Deep. This is not a test.

711
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:18,460
我要你们把这几位先生活活打死
I want you to beat these gentlemen to death... 

712
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:20,960
现在就动手
now.

713
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:27,850
我看我们还是离开吧
I think maybe we should go.

714
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:30,560
天哪
Oh, Jesus!

715
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:34,440
他妈的
Oh, shit.

716
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:41,570
天哪
Jesus!

717
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:53,200
待在这里
Stay here.

718
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:56,460
等待进一步指示
Wait for further instructions.

719
00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:10,680
搞什么 这也太离谱了吧
Yo, what the fuck? That was so fucked-up, you guys.

720
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,560
他来这里做什么
What the fuck is he doing here?

721
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:20,020
他应该坐在被告席上 不是吗
He should be at his trial, no?

722
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:22,150
糟了
Shit.

723
00:46:25,990 --> 00:46:29,910
这是祖国人刚刚抵达法院的 独家现场图像
This exclusive live footage of Homelander arriving at the courthouse just now.

724
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:31,830
很快就会宣读判决书
The verdict will be read any moment.

725
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:34,200
所以 别走开 继续关注我们稍后的报道
So stay with us after these important messages.

726
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:37,540
准备好停止重复使用导尿管 并开始正常生活了吗
Are you ready to stop reusing your catheter and start living your life?

727
00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:40,960
纽约县法院

728
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,960
星光支持女性 #星光军

729
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,550
保证美国的安全

730
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:46,970
我当然支持祖国人啦 #祖国

731
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:48,260
我不会再沉默下去了 #星光

732
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:49,720
像女孩子一样奋斗

733
00:46:51,390 --> 00:46:52,640
就要宣读判决了
The verdict's coming.

734
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:56,020
陪审员就座了 判决结果马上出炉
Jurors are seated. Any second.

735
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:10,950
无罪
Not guilty!

736
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:21,630
去你妈的 法西斯
Fuck you, fascist!

737
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:50,660
祖国人无罪
From outside the courthouse

738
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:53,950
在法院外为您带来的现场报道 陪审团已作出裁决
where the jury has returned a verdict.

739
00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:55,490
- 祖国人被控谋杀... - 去吧
- Homelander is not guilty of murder. - Go.

740
00:47:55,490 --> 00:47:59,500
被判无罪 法院外的场面一片混乱
The scene outside the courthouse is chaotic. 

741
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:01,580
你能行
You got this.

742
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,090
- 去吧 - 好吧
- Go. Go. - Okay, okay.

743
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:19,230
科林
Colin...

744
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:25,650
科林
Colin!

745
00:48:30,110 --> 00:48:31,110
你没事吧
You all right?

746
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:37,200
科林
Colin. Colin. 

747
00:48:37,910 --> 00:48:39,830
- 不 - 是我
- No, no! It's me. - It's me. Come on.

748
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:44,330
嘿 我没事
I'm-I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay.

749
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:47,670
- 没关系 我没事 - 好吗
Sorry, I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay.

750
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,360
大家保持冷静
Everyone, remain calm. 

751
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:52,650
你们都是非常特别的人
We're all very special people.

752
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:55,490
别打了 住手
Stop it. Stop.

753
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:13,510
各位 拜托了 回家吧
Everybody, please, please go home!

754
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,930
我们可以战斗 但不能这样大打出手
We can fight but not like this!

755
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:18,050
安妮 去找人帮忙 安妮
Annie! Annie! Bitch!

756
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:21,600
嘿 别打她
Hey! Get off of her.

757
00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:24,560
操你妈 婴儿杀手 婊子

758
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:26,390
别打她
Get off of her! Get off of her.

759
00:50:27,310 --> 00:50:29,020
好啦 基拉
Kiara. 

760
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,780
基拉 天哪 救命
Kiara? Oh, God. Help! 

761
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:34,820
救命 来人啊 救命
Help, someone help.

762
00:50:36,490 --> 00:50:37,740
求你了 帮帮忙
Help, please.

763
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:39,410
基拉
Kiara.

764
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,870
- 星光跟他们是一起的 - 麻烦让让
Excuse me, pardon me.

765
00:50:47,870 --> 00:50:49,830
我亲眼看见的 是星光干的
I saw it myself. It was the Starlighters, man.

766
00:50:51,790 --> 00:50:53,920
我知道 另有他人...

767
00:50:58,130 --> 00:50:59,890
请回家去
Please return to your homes.

768
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:02,560
有序离开本场所
Please exit the facility in an orderly fashion.

769
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:07,940
有序离开本场所
Please exit the facility in an orderly fashion.

770
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:10,400
请回家去
Please return to your homes.

771
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,400
有序离开本场所

772
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:16,690
今天 陪审团对祖国人谋杀案 作出无罪的判决时
Justice prevailed today as the jury in Homelander's murder 

773
00:51:16,690 --> 00:51:18,570
正义得到了伸张
trial handed down a not-guilty verdict.

774
00:51:18,570 --> 00:51:19,490
祖国人无罪释放 星光支持者造反闹事

775
00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:22,580
但国民情绪被治愈的那一刻 却悲惨地被缩短了
But that moment of national healing was cut tragically short.

776
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:26,790
星光支持者的暴力袭击 导致三名无辜爱国者死亡
Violent attacks by Starlight supporters left three innocent patriots dead.

777
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:30,460
出于尊重 我们会等到所有家属都收到通知后
Out of respect, we are gonna wait until all families have been notified

778
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:32,630
再公布受害者的姓名
before we release the names of the victims.

779
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:35,130
但我们知道 他们都献出了自己的生命
But we know that each of them gave their lives

780
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:37,630
来行使其宪法权利 以支持...
exercising their constitutional right...

781
00:51:37,630 --> 00:51:39,010
别 让她睡吧
No, let her sleep.

782
00:51:40,050 --> 00:51:42,970
我早上就过去 我们一起告诉她
I'll come by first thing in the morning, we'll tell her together.

783
00:51:42,970 --> 00:51:44,140
好的
Yeah.

784
00:51:49,270 --> 00:51:52,690
你知道我永远不会对你们说谎 对美国来说 今天是黑暗的一天

785
00:51:52,690 --> 00:51:55,020
也许是我报道过的最黑暗的一天

786
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:59,650
唯一让我们感到的安慰是 祖国人将继续自由地保护我们所有人
Our only solace is that Homelander will remain free to protect us all.

787
00:51:59,650 --> 00:52:03,030
现在 这种无休止的 司法错误已成过去
Now that this endless miscarriage of justice is behind him,

788
00:52:03,030 --> 00:52:05,740
祖国人可以重新 将注意力集中在真正重要的事务上
Homelander can return his focus to what really matters--  standing up for the good guys. 

789
00:52:06,410 --> 00:52:07,790
你不想吃完吗
You gonna finish that?

790
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:12,080
拜托 儿子 我们不是在庆祝嘛
Oh, come on, buddy. We're supposed to be celebrating.

791
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:16,840
怎么了
What's wrong?

792
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:19,880
不 我...没什么
No, it... it's nothing.

793
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:22,550
拜托 我们...我们讨论过这件事
Come on, now. We-we talked about this.

794
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:26,640
我们必须跟彼此分享一切
We have to share everything with each other,

795
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:31,980
什么都一起做 直到我们几乎合而为一
do everything together, until we almost merge into one.

796
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:37,530
所以 跟我说说 儿子 说什么都没关系
So, you tell me, son. Whatever it is, it's-it's okay.

797
00:52:39,610 --> 00:52:41,860
我不想让布彻尔死
I don't want Butcher to die.

798
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,830
可他那样无情地抛弃了你呀
But even after he abandoned you like that?

799
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:55,540
那么做太残忍了
That was brutal.

800
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:57,590
他还说了那些伤害你的话
And all those things he said about you.

801
00:52:57,590 --> 00:53:00,420
那些话真让人听不下去
He said awful, awful things about you.

802
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:01,880
太难听了
Just horrible.

803
00:53:04,470 --> 00:53:05,680
我妈爱过他
My mom loved him.

804
00:53:19,150 --> 00:53:20,400
那你呢
But what about you?

805
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:42,300
玄色说得对 那么做太离谱了
Noir was right, that was so fucked-up.

806
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:46,340
你完全有权利感到难过 我为你感到难过
You have every right to be upset. I'm upset for you.

807
00:53:46,970 --> 00:53:48,890
我们直接走人不行吗
What if we just left?

808
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:53,730
我们可以永远地遁世于海浪之下
We could vanish under the waves forever.

809
00:53:54,890 --> 00:53:57,150
海里的每种生物都会爱着真实的你
Everyone there loves you for you.

810
00:53:57,650 --> 00:54:01,610
你是一个可爱 敏感 非常强壮的游泳健将
As the sweet, sensitive, really strong swimmer you are.

811
00:54:03,570 --> 00:54:04,820
看着我
Look at me.

812
00:54:07,530 --> 00:54:09,660
宝贝 看着我
Baby, look at me.

813
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:14,160
那时我们就不必再隐藏我们的爱了
We wouldn't have to hide our love anymore.

814
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:17,960
我们可以做自己
We could just be Kevin and Ambrosius.

815
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:30,740
爸

816
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:35,120
嘿 我刚刚读完《致命十字》
Hey, so, I just finished reading Deadly Cross.

817
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:37,750
帕特森怎么写得这么好
I mean, how does Patterson do it?

818
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:41,210
比《十字交叉》 《十字正义》 《双十字》
I liked it even more than Criss Cross, Cross Justice,

819
00:55:41,210 --> 00:55:43,380
《三十字》还好
Double Cross, Triple Cross,

820
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:47,590
比《穿越火线》 《穿越国家》 《穿越界限》 《穿越我心》还好
Cross Fire, Cross Country, Cross the Line, even Cross My Heart.

821
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:50,890
总之 要谈的多着呢
You know, so, anyway, lots to talk about. 

822
00:55:50,890 --> 00:55:53,100
给我打电话 我爱你 儿子
Uh, give me a call. I love you, son.

823
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:05,110
你会好起来的 好吗
You get better, okay?

824
00:56:06,150 --> 00:56:11,490
好起来吧 我会和你聊《致命十字》 聊上几个小时
You get better, and I will talk to you for hours about Deadly Cross.

825
00:56:11,490 --> 00:56:14,280
如果愿意的话 你可以把整本书都读给我听
You can read the whole fucking book to me if you want.

826
00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:17,580
说定了
Deal?

827
00:56:20,290 --> 00:56:22,040
我真的希望你能听到我说的话
I really hope you can hear me.

828
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:27,760
无论如何 我认为他听得到
For what it's worth, I think he can.

829
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:37,140
妈
Mom?

830
00:56:44,650 --> 00:56:45,730
比利
Billy.

831
00:56:48,610 --> 00:56:51,360
你答应过我你会照顾莱恩
You promised me you would take care of Ryan.

832
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:55,450
妈的 我不是正在想办法照顾他吗
Bloody hell, what'd you think I'm trying to do here?

833
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:59,580
我觉得你又要连累休伊了
I think you're about to fuck over Hughie, again.

834
00:57:00,410 --> 00:57:02,750
这样做会再次 让你搬起石头砸自己的脚
And it's going to blow up in your face, again.

835
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:05,840
听着 我在沃特塔时 救了那孩子 不是吗
I saved the kid, at the Tower, didn't I?

836
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:09,920
我本可以干掉祖国人的 一切准备就绪 就差最后一击了
I had a clean shot at Homelander, game, set and fucking match,

837
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:11,670
但我选择了救莱恩
but I chose to save him.

838
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:15,430
看看现在结果如何
And look where it got us.

839
00:57:16,930 --> 00:57:18,350
你答应过我
You promised me.

840
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:24,980
如果莱恩变得像祖国人一样 那就是世界末日了
If Ryan becomes like Homelander, that's the end of the world.

841
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,030
你以为我不知道吗
Don't you think I know that?

842
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:31,990
你必须找到更好的方法
You have to find a better way.

843
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:37,160
你到底想让我怎样 贝嘉
What the hell do you want from me, Becca?

844
00:57:43,290 --> 00:57:44,830
做回那个娶我的男人
Be the man that I married.

845
00:57:53,050 --> 00:57:55,130
那个人早就死了
That man died a long time ago.

846
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:57,640
太晚了
It's too late.

847
00:57:58,640 --> 00:57:59,850
我没时间了
I'm out of time...

848
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:24,710
发件人:布彻尔 主题:抵押品

849
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:26,870
休伊掌握的你的污点材料 查收吧

850
00:58:30,630 --> 00:58:31,920
真他妈的
Oh, for fuck's sake.

851
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:41,010
你现在开心了吧
Well, I hope you're happy now.

852
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:08,040
{\an9}? God save the queen ?

853
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:11,130
{\an9}? The fascist regime ?

854
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:14,710
{\an9}? It made you a moron ?

855
00:59:15,710 --> 00:59:17,470
{\an9}? Potential H-bomb ?

856
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:20,760
{\an9}? God save the queen ?

857
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:24,060
{\an9}? She ain't no human being ?

858
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:28,480
{\an9}? There is no future ?

859
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:31,730
{\an9}? In England's dreaming ?

860
00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:34,900
{\an9}? Don't be told what you want to want to ?

861
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:38,110
{\an9}? And don't be told what you want to need ?

862
00:59:38,110 --> 00:59:41,320
{\an9}? There's no future, no future ?

863
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:44,410
{\an9}? No future for you ?

864
00:59:44,410 --> 00:59:46,370
{\an9}? God save the queen ?

865
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:49,500
{\an9}? We mean it, man ?

866
00:59:50,830 --> 00:59:52,920
{\an9}? We love our queen ?

867
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:56,300
{\an9}? God saves ?

868
00:59:57,550 --> 00:59:59,300
{\an9}? God save the queen ?

869
01:00:00,550 --> 01:00:02,590
{\an9}? 'Cause tourists are money ?

870
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:05,930
{\an9}? And our figurehead ?

871
01:00:06,930 --> 01:00:09,230
{\an9}? Is not what she seems ?

872
01:00:10,350 --> 01:00:12,440
{\an9}? Oh, God save history ?

873
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:15,690
{\an9}? God save your mad parade ?

874
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:19,900
{\an9}? Oh, Lord, God have mercy ?

875
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:22,610
{\an9}? All crimes are paid ?

876
01:00:22,610 --> 01:00:26,290
{\an9}? When there's no future, how can there be sin? ?

877
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:29,660
{\an9}? We're the flowers in the dustbin ?

878
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:32,830
{\an9}? We're the poison in your human machine ?

879
01:00:32,830 --> 01:00:36,170
{\an9}? We're the future, your future ?

880
01:00:36,170 --> 01:00:38,170
{\an9}? God save the queen ?

881
01:00:39,170 --> 01:00:41,630
{\an9}? We mean it, man ?

882
01:00:42,630 --> 01:00:44,720
{\an9}? We love our queen ?

883
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:48,640
{\an9}? God saves ?

884
01:00:49,810 --> 01:00:52,020
{\an9}? No future ?

885
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:55,560
{\an9}? No future ?

886
01:00:55,560 --> 01:01:01,200
{\an9}? No future for me ?

887
01:01:02,530 --> 01:01:05,320
{\an9}? No future ?

888
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:08,540
{\an9}? No future ?

889
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:13,420
{\an9}? No future for you ?

890
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:17,670
{\an9}? No future ?
