1
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,420
Go on, son. Have a bump.

2
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,640
- Shit. - What the fuck?

3
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,180
- Homelander's gonna love this. - No, no, no, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

5
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:27,650
Homelander has agreed to donate to the Starlight House, which is...

6
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:29,980
- No. No. - I mean, giv... Come on, give it up.

7
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,860
- Give it up for this guy. - No, no, no.

8
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:35,700
I'm not just like the rest of you, I'm better.

9
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,950
Homelander is a fucking psychopath.

10
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,370
Homelander is protecting them.

11
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,410
You said you'd always looked out for me. You promised!

12
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,130
- Well, maybe I don't want to look at you. - I hate you.

13
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,130
This little guy here is my son.

14
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:49,500
Fuck you, fascist!

15
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:58,430
You help me out with one small favor, and I'll help you.

16
00:00:58,430 --> 00:00:59,510
Do you have it or not?

17
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:01,970
Original recipe, all 11 herbs and spices.

18
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:03,930
Just a pinch.

19
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:07,480
My name is Annie January, and I fucking quit.

20
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,230
I say you're one of the Boys.

21
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:14,150
You are like rabid little doggy, but loyal to whoever holds this chain.

22
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:15,110
Your brain's leaking.

23
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:17,110
Temp V is gonna kill you both.

24
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:18,200
How long I got? 

25
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,410
Months. 12 on the outside.

26
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:23,410
Homelander needs to die. That's it. Whatever it takes.

27
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:25,710
Soldier Boy's our weapon. He's how we kill Homelander.

28
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,580
Did you know? That Soldier Boy was my father?

29
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,130
- Get out of the building, now. - Butcher, stop!

30
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,640
The thing you wanted, he's right fucking there, 

31
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,640
and now you blink?

32
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,550
I made a promise.

33
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:41,220
You don't need me anymore.

34
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,260
I could jump.

35
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:43,890
You can fucking fly.

36
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:57,530
{\an9}? God save the queen ?

37
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:00,740
{\an9}? The fascist regime ?

38
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,490
{\an9}? They made you a moron ?

39
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,870
{\an9}? A potential H-bomb ?

40
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,330
{\an9}? God save the queen ?

41
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,500
{\an9}? She ain't no human being ?

42
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,590
{\an9}? And there's no future ?

43
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,140
{\an9}? God saves. ?

44
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,180
Good evening!

45
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,480
Now, look, I know it's a late night,

46
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,520
so I just wanted to come out and say thanks for your patience.

47
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,440
The bar remains open, and, uh...

48
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,860
Oh, yeah, Colorado and Nevada just went to Robert Singer!

49
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,700
So, stay tuned.

50
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:49,580
I feel like we're gonna be back very soon with some very good news.

51
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:52,590
Thank you, and God bless America!

52
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:07,100
Motherfucking Gruy��re puffs? What am I supposed to do with these?

53
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:10,770
She says you've been working too hard. You need to eat more.

54
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:13,730
We pull this off, I promise I'll grub all these motherfuckers.

55
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,780
Hughie, come on. I need eyes.

56
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,290
Yeah, yeah, just give me one... more second.

57
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:32,080
Sorry, sorry. There's, like, a million connectors in here, and I can't see shit.

58
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,170
Are you helping, or you just showing off?

59
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,510
Oh, for sure both.

60
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,760
Is that it?

61
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,180
All right, live and in living color.

62
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,060
Butcher, you copy?

63
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:51,190
Where the fuck is Butcher?

64
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,370
Oh, don't you fucking start. 

65
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,030
I'm fine.

66
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:08,120
Charcuter.

67
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,830
Who are you talking to?

68
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,040
I ain't said a word.

69
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,170
Geez.

70
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,710
All right. 

71
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:22,050
Come on, then.

72
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,930
Evening, cunts.

73
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,600
We're here to commit a bit of high treason.

74
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,240
Going up.

75
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,920
Hey, whoa, hey.

76
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:00,090
The plan is you wait here, cover our exit, no?

77
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:02,760
Oh, come off it. Watch a fucking door?

78
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,630
Kimiko, if Butcher steps one foot in that elevator, break his arm.

79
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,470
Please remove obstruction from doors.

80
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,230
Fuck me.

81
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,570
Okay, big man, let's do this.

82
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,580
There's a lot of people in there.

83
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,000
Come on, kiddo.

84
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:22,210
Would you be scared of a bunch of cockroaches? Huh?

85
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:23,840
Yeah. 

86
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,470
Then baby chicks or whatever.

87
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:31,640
Look, the-the point is, you have nothing to be nervous about.

88
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,390
Come on. We've talked about this.

89
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,310
They're only humans and...?

90
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,140
Toys for our amusement.

91
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,690
- That's right. - Yeah.

92
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:41,980
We got this.

93
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:58,790
Hold up, hold up. Okay, we got a problem.

94
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,840
W-Wait, what is... he doing here?

95
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,960
Homelander's in the building. If you see him, do not engage. 

96
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,010
I repeat, do not engage with Homelander.

97
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:10,930
That means you, Butcher, you copy?

98
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:14,260
My goodness, you look beautiful this evening. Especially you. 

99
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:17,640
- Zoe, uh, y-you remember my son, Ryan? - Yeah. Hi.

100
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,560
Hi.

101
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,850
Hey, Zo, you know what? 

102
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:21,900
I heard that this hotel makes its own ice cream.

103
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,980
Why don't you take Ryan and try and find some, huh?

104
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:26,020
What a great idea. Go for it, sport.

105
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:28,990
Just nobody come back pregnant.

106
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,280
Just kidding.

107
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,200
I'm kidding, I'm kidding. They're too young. Although,

108
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,580
Ryan could spew goo if he wanted to.

109
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,830
What the fuck are you doing here?

110
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:43,040
Oh, I've supported every new administration for the past 16 years.

111
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,880
I don't want your support. You're on trial for fucking murder.

112
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,920
Hi, Doug.

113
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:51,840
One, that's a formality, and two, that's a clear-cut case of self-defense.

114
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:54,800
That thug threw a projectile at my son.

115
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,390
It was a plastic bottle.

116
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,850
Could've had anthrax in it.

117
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:00,810
Not that that would've hurt us, but there was a principle at stake.

118
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:03,560
And, besides, when I took that monster down, 

119
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,730
- people applauded. - Your shareholders didn't.

120
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:10,740
Well, that's why you and me are gonna prove to them

121
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,530
that even with a "soft on crime" fucking libtard for a president...

122
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:17,910
...it's gonna be business as usual at Vought.

123
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:22,160
Any transaction you and I may or may not have had is ancient history.

124
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:31,300
Well, then let's make some new history.

125
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,340
Ladies and gentlemen, Victoria Neuman.

126
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:35,930
Let's give her a round. Huh?

127
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:39,770
Girls get it done in the White House.

128
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,140
God bless you.

129
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,290
Give us a minute here, would you, love?

130
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,470
Listen, Ryan, I've got a lot to say...

131
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,310
and fuck all time to say it.

132
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,890
I got a lorry out back. I can get you out of here.

133
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,180
What are you talking about?

134
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,140
I know you're angry at me, and you've got every right to be.

135
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:28,690
But you know how dangerous Homelander is.

136
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:29,770
He's my dad.

137
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:32,360
Right. H-He murdered some poor sod right in front of your eyes.

138
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,030
That guy was a pedophile.

139
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,820
It ain't true. He-He's lying to you.

140
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:40,410
Let me take you to Grace, all right? A-And then you don't got to see me no more.

141
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,210
Please, I'm... I'm begging you.

142
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,540
It's what your mom would want.

143
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,420
No means no, William.

144
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,760
This isn't the Neverland Ranch.

145
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,720
Don't worry. Nothing bad's gonna happen, 

146
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,760
right?

147
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,060
Seems it already has.

148
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,940
Look at that big black mass curdling around your brain.

149
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:14,860
What do you got, six months?

150
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,070
Less?

151
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,450
That's too bad. W-We're not gonna have that last dance together.

152
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:23,870
I'll miss us.

153
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:28,750
Bloody hell. You wank to your own voice, don't you?

154
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,170
That's the spirit, champ.

155
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,380
Son.

156
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:45,680
Come on. 

157
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,480
I do not want to miss Smash Mouth.

158
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,950
{\an9}? It ain't no joke ?

159
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:05,370
{\an9}? I'd like to buy the world a toke ?

160
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:07,750
{\an9}? And teach the world to sing in perfect harmony ?

161
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,420
{\an9}? And teach the world... ?

162
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,420
So many pantsuits.

163
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,210
{\an9}? And the liars, hey, I know ?

164
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:15,000
{\an9}? It's just a song, but it's spice ?

165
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,010
{\an9}? For the recipe, this is a love attack ?

166
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,340
{\an9}? I know it went out, but it's back ?

167
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,010
{\an9}? It's just like any fad ?

168
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:24,300
{\an9}? It retracts before impact ?

169
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,810
{\an9}? And just like fashion, it's a passion for the ?

170
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:28,770
{\an9}? With-it and hip, if you got the goods ?

171
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:30,230
{\an9}? They'll come and buy it...

172
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:31,140
Mom?

173
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,940
What are you doing in here?

174
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:37,400
Apologies, Miss Neuman,

175
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,440
- we're with your mother's detail. - Is that Zoe?

176
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,150
We'll be done in just a minute.

177
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,120
Why don't you wait outside.

178
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,250
- Frenchie, what's happening? - She's a fucking Supe.

179
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,250
She's a fucking Supe!

180
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,720
Yeah, I guess I'll just, uh...

181
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,090
...wait here.

182
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:09,850
It's okay.

183
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:11,560
We see nothing.

184
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:32,000
We need an exit, now!

185
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,170
There's a window on the south end of the hallway.

186
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,470
Uh... We're eight stories up.

187
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,390
Frenchie, trust me.

188
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,380
- No! - Frenchie!

189
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,800
Motherfucker.

190
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,060
Yes.

191
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,520
- Oh, shit. - Oh, mon Dieu.

192
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,440
Oh, God.

193
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,650
Oh, gross.

194
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,250
Thank Christ. Can we go now? Jesus.

195
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,290
- Hey, you. - Hey.

196
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:02,550
You got to teach Butcher the meaning of the word "covert." He just got made by a 12-year-old.

197
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,300
You mean Zoe, who just murdered two guys?

198
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:08,260
Vic, you-you shot your own daughter up with V? How could you do that to her?

199
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,180
- I needed to keep her safe. - Safe?

200
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,560
You turned her into a fucking monster. 

201
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,390
Like you.

202
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:15,850
I'm sorry. That sounds like the pot calling the kettle

203
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:18,650
a teleporting dude with his dick out.

204
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,270
Worst mistake I ever made.

205
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,110
Vic, you and me, we were...

206
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:27,950
We were like family. I mean...

207
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,950
was everything just... bullshit?

208
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:36,000
I almost told you once.

209
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,210
That night of the blackout, you remember?

210
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,840
You brought every bodega snack you could carry for Zoe.

211
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,210
We played Uno with her for hours until the lights came back on.

212
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:47,760
And I thought...

213
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,970
...you were one of my closest friends.

214
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:54,220
I mean, hell, you're dating a Supe.

215
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,640
If anyone would understand, it'd be you, right?

216
00:14:58,350 --> 00:14:59,770
Why didn't you tell me?

217
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:03,230
- I was scared. - Scared you'd have to pop my head.

218
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,770
I was scared to lose you.

219
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:12,410
I always cared about you, Hughie.

220
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,240
That part was real.

221
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,040
Hey, Vicky.

222
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,040
Fuck you!

223
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:29,800
Seriously?

224
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:34,760
I have to be on TV in, like, ten minutes, you fucking asshole.

225
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,640
We're gonna out you. We're gonna go to the press, tell them you blew up Congress.

226
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,480
- I still, I still got the Red River files. - Okay, okay, okay. Have you ever seen WarGames?

227
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,690
What am I saying, look at you, of course you've seen fucking WarGames.

228
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:45,360
- We're making jokes? - Mutually assured destruction.

229
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,740
I hurt you, you out me. You out me, I kill everyone you've ever loved.

230
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,660
The only thing that makes sense is a truce.

231
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:56,410
Or plan B.

232
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,580
Jesus fucking...

233
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,040
How is it you guys are actually getting worse at your jobs?

234
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:13,550
They just called Arizona.

235
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:16,680
Guess I better go change.

241
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,450
Nice of you to show up. Where the hell you been?

243
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,170
The bog. Trying to wash off the stench of failure from your cock-up last night.

244
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:47,960
Shut the fuck up, Butcher.

245
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,630
Grace.

246
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,800
- Not you. - Oh, come off it.

247
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,930
I washed my bollocks and all. M? 

248
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:02,180
There are people who,

249
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,600
because of ignorance or maybe insanity,

250
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,020
still believe you have something to contribute.

251
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,020
I'm not one of them.

252
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:12,070
I'll get the kid back, Grace.

253
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:13,450
I'll make it right.

254
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:23,580
Two agents from my detail are dead at the hands of a 12-year-old.

255
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:28,210
We had to tell their families they snorted fentanyl-laced cocaine at the after-party.

256
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:31,550
- Sir, our intel told us the acid would work on Neuman. - She's no idiot.

257
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,920
She'll know I was behind it.

258
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,680
Goddamn it! Everyone told me to pick Buttigieg instead.

259
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,890
You didn't know, sir. Marvin,

260
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:42,020
I vouched for you. The CIA is bankrolling you.

261
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,270
All due respect, ma'am,

262
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:46,520
you can always put Butcher back in charge. He's right outside.

263
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,480
- What about Starlight? - She goes by Annie now.

264
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,730
Can Annie burn out Neuman's fucking eyes, debilitate her?

265
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:54,860
If she can get close enough to her without getting her head popped off, who knows?

266
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,860
But we might have to accept the possibility 

267
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,870
that Neuman's... invulnerable.

268
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:01,830
Congress certifies the election January 6.

269
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:05,710
After that, a Supe is one heartbeat away from the presidency.

270
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,710
My fucking heartbeat.

271
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:11,290
Now, I can only keep my distance from her for so long.

272
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:15,090
- Eliminating her is top priority. - So do your fucking job.

273
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:16,420
Yes, ma'am.

274
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,220
Fuck.

276
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,270
Somewhere else you need to be?

277
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,230
No, sir.

279
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:33,190
Billy Butcher.

280
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,400
Joe Kessler. Fuck me. How long's it been?

281
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,990
Uh, I'd say 11 years, but, officially speaking, none of that shit show ever happened.

282
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:46,410
Then how come I remember you high on opium, rimming out the General's wife?

283
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:47,460
Well, fuck you.

284
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,840
Hey, let me buy you a bad cup of coffee.

285
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:57,800
Demoted from your own fucking team. What's your shitty code name again?

286
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,880
The Boys.

287
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,680
Oof. Who came up with that shit?

288
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:05,270
Why you putting up with it? Walk away.

289
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:08,180
No, my son, I've got plans and schemes.

290
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:11,100
I'll be back at the head of the table in no time.

291
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,150
Well, you better.

292
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,820
You know, a lot of the guys are thinking you got benched

293
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,030
at the worst possible time.

294
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:20,410
You know, Mallory's so focused on killing the VP-Elect

295
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:23,410
'cause that's what Singer wants, and half of goddamn Langley's on it.

296
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:24,580
Well, you know Grace, 

297
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,540
she's always been a bit of a political animal.

298
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,370
And what are you focused on?

299
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,250
Homelander.

300
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,380
He killed that poor cunt in broad daylight, 

301
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,750
and they fucking cheered.

302
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:37,710
I mean, what you think that taught him, eh?

303
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,760
No.

304
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,600
We're whistling away towards a fucking apocalypse,

305
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,890
and Grace's eye ain't on the ball.

306
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:48,730
You had a clean shot at him, right?

307
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,690
With Soldier Boy? 

308
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,100
You didn't take it.

309
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,980
Was your eye on the ball?

310
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:00,700
Why do I get the feeling we ain't just bumped into each other?

311
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,740
You remember the Panjshir Valley?

312
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:05,490
Yeah. 

313
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:08,040
Pretty hard to forget.

314
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,290
You dragged me out of there and dropped how many bodies to do it,

315
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:13,500
without giving it a second fucking thought.

316
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,840
And yet you still didn't name your son after me, eh?

317
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,090
We need someone like you, Billy. 

318
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,170
Right fucking now.

319
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:25,050
Before the Supes start rounding us up and dumping us off in camps.

320
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,980
- Hey. - A tie? You going to prom?

321
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,400
- What's up? - Janine.

322
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,370
She got into a fight at school.

323
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,330
Principal didn't say why, just that she KO'd a boy.

324
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:50,450
A boy?

325
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,410
Don't you dare be proud right now.

326
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:55,170
She's been slamming doors, Marvin.

327
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,420
She told me 

328
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,670
to "eat a dick."

329
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:00,300
Janine said that?

330
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,840
She's been having a hard time since Todd moved out.

331
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,430
You mean, since you kicked him out?

332
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,510
Let's dial down the glee in your voice, 

333
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:11,640
but, yes, since I kicked him out. But Janine still loves him.

334
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,690
- She's worried. - Worried about what?

335
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:17,940
Todd got so deep into all that weird Hometeamer shit.

336
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,230
He's not answering my calls. 

337
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:21,150
- I don't know where he is. - Okay, so...?

338
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:22,740
And you're good at finding people.

339
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,160
- Oh, come on. Monique-- - For your daughter, Marvin.

340
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,120
Well, I get what you saw in that guy. 

341
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,420
He was good to Janine.

342
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,040
'Cause it sure as shit wasn't the D.

343
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:46,050
Right?

344
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,890
You have to be good. 

345
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:52,560
You're my greatest failure.

346
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:54,980
It's your destiny.

349
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,280
It's because deep down there's a part 

350
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,200
of you that is still...human.

351
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,590
Don't get brazen with me.

352
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:23,340
You're not to refer to the deceased as the "victim."

353
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,840
It's a loaded term and for the jury to decide.

354
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,890
Sir, so I'm afraid we are behind on the Tower Reconstruction,

355
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:33,180
but I can 100% assure you that it is not my fault.

356
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:35,220
But it wasn't until Annie January stepped out

357
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,640
from Vought's shadow, and Homelander's,

359
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,650
that we saw the true extent of her power.

360
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,570
Vought and Homelander aren't above the law.

361
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:45,360
They can't just do whatever they want.

362
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:49,030
Deep, we got to talk about the octopus in the room.

364
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:52,280
Your ex, Cassandra, wrote a tell-all book--

365
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,240
I'm gonna have to stop you right there, Hailey.

366
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,750
You know, there were no relations with an octopus.

367
00:22:56,750 --> 00:23:01,000
It's, uh, it's just a racist rumor and a ridiculous lie perpetuated by a jilted and, uh... 

368
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,300
emotionally unstable hysterical woman,

369
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,050
who, let's be clear, pooped in my bed.

370
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:10,840
Deep, please tell me the fucking octopus is gone.

371
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,970
Yes, Ashley. She's...

372
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:16,430
It is taken care of. Okay?

373
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,310
Hey, Noir.

374
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:23,020
Sir, after that debacle at Godolkin-- thank you again for saving my life--

375
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:26,530
the board felt we should find new candidates for The Seven, ASAP.

376
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:30,320
The selection committee has narrowed it down to 25 choices.

377
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,790
Um, okay, great.

378
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,910
If we're going purely on socials, I might suggest Talon out of Redlands.

379
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:42,500
Pass. She's a butterface.

380
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,630
- Her body's on point, but her face... - Yeah, I get it.

381
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:47,880
Thank you so much for explaining.

382
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,470
Chauvinist prick.

384
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:52,340
Ugh, not that slutty cum rag.

386
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:56,260
- Hold up, I thought he ate a dog. - He ate out a dog.

387
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,850
It's a big difference.

388
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,940
Sister Sage? Hell no.

389
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:07,780
She was with me in Teenage Kix for, like, barely a year before they canned her ass. 

390
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,900
- What's her power? - She's the world's smartest person.

391
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:13,490
She's not smart enough to know when to shut her mouth.

392
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:15,910
- Wrangler. Isn't he a... - Texas nutjob. 

393
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:18,790
The San Antonio office had to cover up those migrant murders.

394
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,450
- I kind of like him. - Of course,

395
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:23,210
he bumps us with suburban women and white men over 50.

396
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:24,960
Amazing choice, sir.

397
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,170
Yeah, I totally agree. He's a mensch. Did I use that word right? Mensch?

398
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:29,550
You just said he was crazy.

399
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:33,260
What I meant was we would be crazy to, you know, not bring him in.

400
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:44,100
I am surrounded by sycophants and fucking imbeciles.

401
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,270
It's just that you make a lot of really great points, sir.

402
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,980
Deep, just...

403
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,030
Blow A-Train.

404
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:00,870
- What? - I'm not kidding. 

405
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:04,750
Go over there, pull out A-Train's cock and blow him.

406
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,920
Okay.

407
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,310
Get up.

408
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,920
Sex is just a spectrum, right, bro?

409
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,830
Get off your fucking knees.

410
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:53,340
This is exactly

411
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:57,130
what I'm talking about. Not one of you has the stomach to challenge anything I say.

412
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:59,100
Oh, my God.

413
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:02,850
I have got to carry this entire fucking company on my shoulders.

414
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:04,730
You're... right?

415
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:14,570
I wasn't gonna do it.

417
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:21,330
Homelander faces his toughest opponent yet, our corrupt legal system.

418
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,240
Smash that donate button, get a free tote--

419
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,910
Roland Keating attacked Homelander's son.

422
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:32,130
The magic of Vought on Ice, coming December 7 at VoughtCoin Arena.

423
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:35,170
Things grew heated between the Starlighter and Hometeamer movements outside 

424
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:36,590
the courthouse today.

425
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:41,140
This creep had photos of his quote-unquote "niece"

426
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,050
naked in the bathtub.

427
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:44,810
He's an antifa pedo who fucked around and found out.

428
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:47,560
And "an eye for an eye" might be in the Jew section of the Bible,

429
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,560
but it is still in the Bible.

430
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:03,120
Yes. Steady.

432
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,240
Good, good.

433
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,710
Yes. Annie, that was awesome. 

434
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:12,710
Look, look. It's a new record. 

435
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:14,590
33 seconds.

436
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:18,720
Oh, amazing. I can fly 100 feet away from all my cares.

437
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,720
And drain the power grid at the same time.

438
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,930
What would Greta say?

440
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,110
Six months of work, c'est merde!

441
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,320
So the acid didn't work.

442
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,370
We'll think of something else.

443
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:43,620
Like what? Yeah.

444
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,250
Hey, look, I-I-I totally agree with whatever you said.

445
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:52,330
No one wants Neuman gone more than me, and no one knows how dangerous she is for the country.

446
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:56,670
Yeah, we may never get another shot like that ever again...

447
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:58,960
- I am really bad at pep talks. - Oh, you think?

448
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,640
All right, I'm out of here.

449
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,640
Recycling bin, motherfucker.

451
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:10,940
What?

452
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:16,440
He blew our cover with Neuman. He almost got you killed again.

453
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:19,990
You're the only one that wants him here.

454
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,360
We should cut him loose.

455
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,860
We're not cutting him loose.

456
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,080
We're not cutting him loose.

460
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:43,380
Well, it's a fine time to fucking well bring that up, innit?

461
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:54,650
It's gonna be a lot harder to do a murder with them cunts around.

462
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,560
Them? Nah.

463
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,990
They're, uh, hand-picked, sort of secret-secret service, so...

464
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,610
I'm surprised you called.

465
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:05,490
I'm full of surprises, ain't I?

466
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:07,240
What do you want?

467
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:12,290
Well, I was thinking that, uh, you and I could scratch each other's backs.

468
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:15,620
Like when you shot me in the head?

469
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:18,500
I need a hand to get Ryan away from Homelander.

470
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,840
Is that all? 

471
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,960
Boy needs a father.

472
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,470
That cunt ain't no father.

473
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:23,470
And you are?

474
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:34,730
You're between a cock and a hard place.

475
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:37,440
I'm going to put you into that posh VP slot,

476
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,770
and he's gonna make sure you spend the next four years

477
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:43,900
- grabbing your ankles while he shoves it up your ass. - I think I can handle myself.

478
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,450
Oh, you mean that nasty little virus they cooked you up at Godolkin?

479
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,530
Yeah, I know about it,

480
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:54,410
and I know it ain't strong enough to kill Homelander yet.

481
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:57,170
And then there's the hard place.

482
00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:01,800
The full weight of the CIA and my Boys working 24/7 to top you.

483
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:04,550
You need me.

484
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:10,800
If I was even gonna think about this...

485
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,730
I'd want a show of good faith.

486
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,900
The material Hughie has on me from the Red River Group Home.

487
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,810
That don't stop him from going to the press.

488
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:21,940
Mm. Stops them from printing it.

489
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:26,610
Just a wild conspiracy theory from a disgruntled former staffer.

490
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:29,410
Those are my terms.

491
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:33,200
You know where to find me.

492
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:48,880
Motherfucker. I just logged in five minutes ago.

493
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,590
- What's happening? - This shit.

494
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,770
Oh, okay, yeah, you got to hit "Keep me logged in."

495
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:57,730
Sorry. Uh, yeah, "Keep me logged in."

496
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:00,650
But, uh, spoiler alert, that will not keep you logged in.

499
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:07,440
This message is for Hugh Campbell.

500
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,410
I'm calling again from New York Central Hospital.

502
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:12,320
- Your father was admitted... - Fuck. 

503
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:13,950
Fuck!

504
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,370
Kid?

505
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:21,250
Sorry.

506
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:23,540
Dad? I'm...

508
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:35,680
The Starlight House, a so-called "home for at-risk teens."

509
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:38,850
Sure. And Jeff Epstein killed himself.

510
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:41,850
No, the only thing these teens are at risk of is being groomed

511
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:46,730
and thrown into Starlight's LGBTerror-dungeon.

512
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:48,740
Child Lives Matter, folks...

513
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,990
It'd be a lot easier to get media coverage if you were there.

514
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:56,080
Homelander's verdict will 1,000% be innocent,

515
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,450
and I'm not showing up to even dignify that shit.

516
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:01,920
Annie, I'm happy to organize the protest and-and make the speech,

517
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,630
but no one wants to hear it

518
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:06,380
'cause it's the Starlighter Movement and I'm not Starlight.

519
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,630
Well, neither am I.

520
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:08,920
Then, tell that to her.

521
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:14,300
The whole reason I quit was to get away from her.

522
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:17,770
Now, you're killing it with the Starlighters. You don't need me.

523
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:20,730
If-- just if-- you were Starlight,

524
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:23,730
then maybe we'd drum up some real donations.

525
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:28,230
I want to help, of course, but as Annie January.

526
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:31,490
No one's donating to the Annie House. It sounds like we sell raisin cookies.

528
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:37,370
Hey. So, Colin is annoying as hell,

529
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:40,500
but he has saved my ass more than a few times

530
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,910
over the past few months, 

531
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:44,500
so thank you for the rec. He's a champ.

532
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:49,090
Oh, je t'en prie. You know, I can tell this even from our first group meeting.

533
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:53,180
Anonymous meetings. Right there in the name.

534
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:18,120
I should not have brought up our meetings.

535
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:21,450
It's okay. I love my boss knowing I'm an ex-junkie.

541
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:57,220
I am almost never surprised.

542
00:34:58,590 --> 00:34:59,640
May I come in?

543
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:07,390
Sister Sage.

544
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:08,600
Just Sage.

545
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,600
Right.

546
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:13,320
Vought added the "Sister" part.

547
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,530
Can't have one of us without a racial qualifier.

548
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:19,740
Never seen you without the suit. Why incognito?

549
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:23,660
You know, I would've thought the smartest woman on Earth would have a nicer place.

550
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:24,950
Smartest person,

551
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:28,210
and that person's too smart to give a fuck about Pottery Barn.

552
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:31,670
Okay. Preach, sister. Well, um...

553
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,300
You're so smart.

554
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:37,010
Show me.

555
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:40,090
Show me.

556
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,890
Based on your public appearances,

557
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:48,560
your stylist is dying your hair more often.

558
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,890
Used to be every month, now it's every 2.4 weeks.

559
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:53,560
Did she tell you you're going gray, or is she hiding it?

560
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:56,230
So between that and your enlarged prostate...

561
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:57,190
My fucking what?

562
00:35:57,190 --> 00:36:00,280
Look at your hands. You've been washing them more often,

563
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:03,030
so likely you've been peeing more often, which makes sense.

564
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:05,950
You got a lot of power, but you do age.

565
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:11,330
Plus, there's that small matter your own father almost killed you.

566
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:12,460
Wow.

567
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:16,210
Any mouth breather could see 

568
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:18,920
you're going through some existential midlife...

569
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,260
whatever.

570
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:24,300
Pretty ballsy for someone whose power is a party trick.

571
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,470
You are welcome to laser me,

572
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:29,270
but I'm guessing you need me and my party trick for something.

573
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,100
I need advice.

574
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,270
From someone on my level.

575
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:42,360
Of course, if you breathe a word of this, I'll pull you apart bit by bit.

576
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,450
Naturally.

577
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:48,290
God, I've spent my life scaling to the peak of-of Vought.

578
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:52,540
It's all I ever wanted. And-and... now that I have it--

579
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,960
You're still not happy?

580
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:59,050
I save people, they cheer. 

581
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,260
I fucking kill people, they cheer.

582
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,630
It's-it's meaningless.

583
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:08,890
Humans are nothing. They're, they're less than nothing.

584
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:12,430
They're just toys for my amusement.

585
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:14,230
And yet they control everything.

586
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:15,650
It's unnatural.

587
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:19,320
What kind of legacy am-am I gonna leave to my son?

588
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:23,070
A shithole country in a shithole world? Or something better?

589
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:24,320
Something... 

590
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:28,370
pure and cleansed. Like... 

591
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:31,120
marble.

592
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:35,000
You do realize that probably won't make you happy, either.

593
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,590
Still. Tell me how you'd go about it.

594
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,550
Hypothetically.

595
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:46,590
Well... Greece,

596
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:51,430
all democracies, they fail because people are fucking stupid.

597
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:57,730
You don't need an army of Supermen like Nazi bae wanted-- so German.

598
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:03,940
If you crush the masses, who builds your monuments?

599
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:05,740
Who tongues your taint?

600
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:10,450
No. The people will tear it apart themselves,

601
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:12,870
just got to nudge 'em a little.

602
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:17,080
Then you get to swoop in, be the one saving it.

603
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:21,670
Like Caesar.

604
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:24,760
Statistically, it's inevitable.

605
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:39,400
- I'd like you to join the Seven. - No fucking way.

606
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,480
Why not?

607
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,570
Because I'm not wearing some vaguely racist super suit in front 

608
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:45,440
of a bunch of clapping seals.

609
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:49,360
Plus, I'm a Black woman who is a thousand times smarter than you.

610
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,780
Your ego can't handle it.

611
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,990
I'm pretty smart myself. 

612
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:55,870
- See what I mean? - Smart enough to listen.

613
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:00,250
I mean really listen to you.

614
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:05,670
You can stay here, reeking of Taco Bell and loneliness,

615
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,840
or we can put some of your theories into practice on a global scale.

616
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:15,100
When's the last time you got a chance like that?

617
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:27,320
- Butcher, what are you doing here? - Couldn't sleep.

618
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:32,030
What about you?

619
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,620
Um, my dad, he, uh, he had a stroke.

620
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:38,000
Oh, fuck. I'm sorry to hear that, mate.

621
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,330
Just gonna grab a few things before I get back to him.

622
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:43,670
- Is he, uh... - I-I don't know.

623
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,510
He-he called me right before it happened, 

624
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,430
and, um... 

625
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:53,220
I didn't pick up.

626
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:56,520
Why didn't I pick up?

627
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,680
I mean, maybe I could've seen it coming. I could-- I could've... 

628
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:01,020
No, no, no. Hughie. Don't beat yourself up about it. 

629
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,560
There's nothing you could've done.

630
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:06,530
All he ever wants is to chat about some stupid fucking James Patterson book

631
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:08,650
that he's reading, and I couldn't even give him that.

632
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:11,070
And now they're saying that even if he lives...

633
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,450
God.

634
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:16,990
Yeah, well, I know what I'd want.

635
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:20,080
Quick lights out. Better than the alternative.

636
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:23,290
Sitting there, stewing in your mistakes...

637
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,670
...as you wait out the inevitable.

638
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,610
I hope your old man pulls through.

639
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:51,110
Thank you. I-- 

640
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:57,410
Hughie? - Hey.

641
00:40:57,410 --> 00:40:59,330
I'm so sorry.

642
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:02,910
I got here as soon as I could. I'm sorry.

643
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,500
I'm okay.

645
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:25,850
- Turn here. - Right here? 

646
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:30,280
Yes. So, what does the CIA think of you wasting their vast resources,

647
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,570
all to hunt down the phone of Todd?

648
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:36,820
I didn't ask. Just like I didn't ask you to come, either.

649
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:39,370
We are here for you always, mon ami.

651
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:49,920
Colin?

652
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:53,760
Why do you ask?

653
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,760
You've been spending a lot of time...

654
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,050
...together in the bathroom...

655
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:02,520
Sorry, I should've said something.

656
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,980
But it's complicated.

657
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,940
To be clear

658
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:14,490
I love you.

659
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:18,450
But you and I...

660
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:20,450
Are not happening.

661
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:21,790
I know.

662
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:25,580
So if Colin makes you happy...

663
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:28,790
Go be happy.

664
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:32,340
Yo, white boy spotted.

665
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:49,150
How's it going, Nick? 

666
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:50,690
- Here for the meet-up? - Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

667
00:42:50,690 --> 00:42:51,770
Cool.

668
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,990
- That's a good question. - What's that? 

669
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:02,450
She wonders, uh... how a man such as this win the love of a woman

670
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:05,120
like Monique, you know?

671
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,080
Oh, he's, uh, he's nice to my daughter.

672
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,620
Come on, there is only one reason.

673
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:12,460
Todd must be packing some serious heat between his legs.

674
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:14,750
Seriously, Frenchie, you did not have to come.

675
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:16,050
Okay, I'm only saying,

676
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:20,390
the man has some serious Pete Davidson energy over there, no?

677
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:26,930
You recognize her?

678
00:43:26,930 --> 00:43:28,140
Not sure.

679
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:30,940
Hi, fellas. Thanks for making it on such short notice.

680
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:34,230
He's here, right? Like, in the building here?

681
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:37,740
This is the best day of my life.

682
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:40,410
Yeah.

683
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:47,700
Well, you know, Dirk, I'm not actually holding my breath underwater.

684
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,460
I'm technically breathing underwater.

685
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,370
So it's more impressive.

686
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:54,750
A-Train, try these buffalo ranch bacon blasters. They're juicy.

687
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:55,840
Sage.

688
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:58,420
It's good to see you again.

689
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:00,010
What the fuck are you doing here?

690
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:03,220
Homelander's tired of being surrounded by morons.

691
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,390
Hello, everyone. 

692
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:10,020
Homelander! I just want to say, it's a huge honor to be here with you.

693
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:11,640
Right. Now, I can't stay long,

694
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:15,400
but I heard that you are some of my biggest fans,

695
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,860
supporting me when others turned their backs.

696
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:19,780
I just wanted to personally say...

697
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:23,160
thank you for your devotion 

698
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:25,660
and your sacrifice.

699
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:30,620
W-- Well, really, it's you who gives so much to--

700
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:33,790
You people are more than just fans.

701
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:37,710
You're martyrs to the greatest cause on Earth.

702
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:38,630
Open it.

703
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:39,760
You got it.

704
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:44,840
Whoa. Bats.

705
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:46,640
Yeah.

706
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:50,480
I want you to take these bats

707
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:53,060
and beat these gentlemen to death.

708
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:04,910
You're funny.

709
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:08,280
Oh, it's like one of your tests. You want us to say no.

710
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:11,700
No, Deep. This is not a test.

711
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:18,460
I want you to beat these gentlemen to death... 

712
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:20,960
now.

713
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:27,850
I think maybe we should go.

714
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:30,560
Oh, Jesus!

715
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:34,440
Oh, shit.

716
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:41,570
Jesus!

717
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:53,200
Stay here.

718
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:56,460
Wait for further instructions.

719
00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:10,680
Yo, what the fuck? That was so fucked-up, you guys.

720
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,560
What the fuck is he doing here?

721
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:20,020
He should be at his trial, no?

722
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:22,150
Shit.

723
00:46:25,990 --> 00:46:29,910
This exclusive live footage of Homelander arriving at the courthouse just now.

724
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:31,830
The verdict will be read any moment.

725
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:34,200
So stay with us after these important messages.

726
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:37,540
Are you ready to stop reusing your catheter and start living your life?

733
00:46:51,390 --> 00:46:52,640
The verdict's coming.

734
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:56,020
Jurors are seated. Any second.

735
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:10,950
Not guilty!

736
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:21,630
Fuck you, fascist!

737
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:50,660
From outside the courthouse

738
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:53,950
where the jury has returned a verdict.

739
00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:55,490
- Homelander is not guilty of murder. - Go.

740
00:47:55,490 --> 00:47:59,500
The scene outside the courthouse is chaotic. 

741
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:01,580
You got this.

742
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,090
- Go. Go. - Okay, okay.

743
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:19,230
Colin...

744
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:25,650
Colin!

745
00:48:30,110 --> 00:48:31,110
You all right?

746
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:37,200
Colin. Colin. 

747
00:48:37,910 --> 00:48:39,830
- No, no! It's me. - It's me. Come on.

748
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:44,330
I'm-I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay.

749
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:47,670
Sorry, I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay.

750
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,360
Everyone, remain calm. 

751
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:52,650
We're all very special people.

752
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:55,490
Stop it. Stop.

753
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:13,510
Everybody, please, please go home!

754
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,930
We can fight but not like this!

755
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:18,050
Annie! Annie! Bitch!

756
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:21,600
Hey! Get off of her.

758
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:26,390
Get off of her! Get off of her.

759
00:50:27,310 --> 00:50:29,020
Kiara. 

760
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,780
Kiara? Oh, God. Help! 

761
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:34,820
Help, someone help.

762
00:50:36,490 --> 00:50:37,740
Help, please.

763
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:39,410
Kiara.

764
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,870
Excuse me, pardon me.

765
00:50:47,870 --> 00:50:49,830
I saw it myself. It was the Starlighters, man.

767
00:50:58,130 --> 00:50:59,890
Please return to your homes.

768
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:02,560
Please exit the facility in an orderly fashion.

769
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:07,940
Please exit the facility in an orderly fashion.

770
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:10,400
Please return to your homes.

772
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:16,690
Justice prevailed today as the jury in Homelander's murder 

773
00:51:16,690 --> 00:51:18,570
trial handed down a not-guilty verdict.

775
00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:22,580
But that moment of national healing was cut tragically short.

776
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:26,790
Violent attacks by Starlight supporters left three innocent patriots dead.

777
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:30,460
Out of respect, we are gonna wait until all families have been notified

778
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:32,630
before we release the names of the victims.

779
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:35,130
But we know that each of them gave their lives

780
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:37,630
exercising their constitutional right...

781
00:51:37,630 --> 00:51:39,010
No, let her sleep.

782
00:51:40,050 --> 00:51:42,970
I'll come by first thing in the morning, we'll tell her together.

783
00:51:42,970 --> 00:51:44,140
Yeah.

786
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:59,650
Our only solace is that Homelander will remain free to protect us all.

787
00:51:59,650 --> 00:52:03,030
Now that this endless miscarriage of justice is behind him,

788
00:52:03,030 --> 00:52:05,740
Homelander can return his focus to what really matters--  standing up for the good guys. 

789
00:52:06,410 --> 00:52:07,790
You gonna finish that?

790
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:12,080
Oh, come on, buddy. We're supposed to be celebrating.

791
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:16,840
What's wrong?

792
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:19,880
No, it... it's nothing.

793
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:22,550
Come on, now. We-we talked about this.

794
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:26,640
We have to share everything with each other,

795
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:31,980
do everything together, until we almost merge into one.

796
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:37,530
So, you tell me, son. Whatever it is, it's-it's okay.

797
00:52:39,610 --> 00:52:41,860
I don't want Butcher to die.

798
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,830
But even after he abandoned you like that?

799
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:55,540
That was brutal.

800
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:57,590
And all those things he said about you.

801
00:52:57,590 --> 00:53:00,420
He said awful, awful things about you.

802
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:01,880
Just horrible.

803
00:53:04,470 --> 00:53:05,680
My mom loved him.

804
00:53:19,150 --> 00:53:20,400
But what about you?

805
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:42,300
Noir was right, that was so fucked-up.

806
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:46,340
You have every right to be upset. I'm upset for you.

807
00:53:46,970 --> 00:53:48,890
What if we just left?

808
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:53,730
We could vanish under the waves forever.

809
00:53:54,890 --> 00:53:57,150
Everyone there loves you for you.

810
00:53:57,650 --> 00:54:01,610
As the sweet, sensitive, really strong swimmer you are.

811
00:54:03,570 --> 00:54:04,820
Look at me.

812
00:54:07,530 --> 00:54:09,660
Baby, look at me.

813
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:14,160
We wouldn't have to hide our love anymore.

814
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:17,960
We could just be Kevin and Ambrosius.

816
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:35,120
Hey, so, I just finished reading Deadly Cross.

817
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:37,750
I mean, how does Patterson do it?

818
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:41,210
I liked it even more than Criss Cross, Cross Justice,

819
00:55:41,210 --> 00:55:43,380
Double Cross, Triple Cross,

820
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:47,590
Cross Fire, Cross Country, Cross the Line, even Cross My Heart.

821
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:50,890
You know, so, anyway, lots to talk about. 

822
00:55:50,890 --> 00:55:53,100
Uh, give me a call. I love you, son.

823
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:05,110
You get better, okay?

824
00:56:06,150 --> 00:56:11,490
You get better, and I will talk to you for hours about Deadly Cross.

825
00:56:11,490 --> 00:56:14,280
You can read the whole fucking book to me if you want.

826
00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:17,580
Deal?

827
00:56:20,290 --> 00:56:22,040
I really hope you can hear me.

828
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:27,760
For what it's worth, I think he can.

829
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:37,140
Mom?

830
00:56:44,650 --> 00:56:45,730
Billy.

831
00:56:48,610 --> 00:56:51,360
You promised me you would take care of Ryan.

832
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:55,450
Bloody hell, what'd you think I'm trying to do here?

833
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:59,580
I think you're about to fuck over Hughie, again.

834
00:57:00,410 --> 00:57:02,750
And it's going to blow up in your face, again.

835
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:05,840
I saved the kid, at the Tower, didn't I?

836
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:09,920
I had a clean shot at Homelander, game, set and fucking match,

837
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:11,670
but I chose to save him.

838
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:15,430
And look where it got us.

839
00:57:16,930 --> 00:57:18,350
You promised me.

840
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:24,980
If Ryan becomes like Homelander, that's the end of the world.

841
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,030
Don't you think I know that?

842
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:31,990
You have to find a better way.

843
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:37,160
What the hell do you want from me, Becca?

844
00:57:43,290 --> 00:57:44,830
Be the man that I married.

845
00:57:53,050 --> 00:57:55,130
That man died a long time ago.

846
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:57,640
It's too late.

847
00:57:58,640 --> 00:57:59,850
I'm out of time...

850
00:58:30,630 --> 00:58:31,920
Oh, for fuck's sake.

851
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:41,010
Well, I hope you're happy now.

852
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:08,040
{\an9}? God save the queen ?

853
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:11,130
