地球由我和我的伙伴们保护，

- 现在安装零件 - 武器失效

00:00:39,865 --> 00:00:41,600
- 零件已经装好了，博士! - 快离开这里!

9
00:01:09,265 --> 00:01:10,833

15
00:01:25,624 --> 00:01:28,545
话说，它安全吗?
Whatever that is, is it safe?

00:01:30,142 --> 00:01:32,451
尽快送过去就行
Just get it there quick as you can.

我想应该是提供早餐的地方
I presumed it would be somewhere that served breakfast.

00:04:18,404 --> 00:04:20,440
- Jo Patterson. - Leo Rugazzi.

Rugazzi技术的CEO

33
00:04:22,507 --> 00:04:24,533
我18个月前收购了Leo的公司

34
00:04:24,618 --> 00:04:27,235
我看到你现在买了很多公司
I see you buying a lot of companies right now.

35
00:04:27,516 --> 00:04:30,282
他们叫你美国人迈克·阿什利
They're calling you the American Mike Ashley.

36
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:34,447
现在市场上有很多值钱的东西

37
00:04:34,532 --> 00:04:36,400
你的政治野心被毁了
Having your political ambitions ruined

38
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:38,376
因为那件小小的有毒废物丑闻
by that little toxic waste scandal

39
00:04:38,461 --> 00:04:40,813
塞翁失马焉知非福
seems to have been a blessing in disguise.

40
00:04:40,898 --> 00:04:43,446
这对我来说是个非常敏感的话题
That's a very sensitive subject for me.

41
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,986
我只想说我超兴奋的
I just wanted to say that I am super-psyched

42
00:04:46,071 --> 00:04:49,664
终于有个合适的技术秘书了
about having a proper Technology Secretary at last.

43
00:04:49,797 --> 00:04:51,696
我也非常兴奋，
I was super-psyched too,

44
00:04:51,781 --> 00:04:54,398
直到他们告诉我，我的预算是2.7英镑
until they told me that my budget was £2.70.

45
00:04:54,789 --> 00:04:57,226
如果有人能成功的话，那就是你了，Jo

50
00:05:12,358 --> 00:05:15,648
我们都知道当今世界面临的问题

51
00:05:15,781 --> 00:05:19,430
对我们领导人的信任处于历史最低水平
Trust in our leaders is at an all-time low.

52
00:05:20,023 --> 00:05:22,281
国内动乱正在加剧
Civil unrest is growing.

53
00:05:22,393 --> 00:05:25,757
安全预算正在下降
Security budgets are falling.

54

00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,396
天啊，我希望没人会受伤

56
00:05:35,582 --> 00:05:37,590
问题是显而易见的

57
00:05:37,675 --> 00:05:39,406

60
00:06:16,359 --> 00:06:18,593
实际并没有用催泪瓦斯
We're not using actual CS gas.

61
00:06:18,742 --> 00:06:21,070
我还是觉得这样挺好的
I still think it would have been fine.

62
00:06:30,912 --> 00:06:33,172

Sonic deterrent!

63

完全的机器人与人工智能界面程序

对于每一个可能发生的事,
for every eventuality,

65
00:06:43,632 --> 00:06:46,945
多亏了广泛的真实场景测试

00:06:47,045 --> 00:06:50,906
呃,太阳能…太阳能能源等级为a级

00:06:51,015 --> 00:06:52,304
你自己建的?
You built this yourself?

68
00:06:52,344 --> 00:06:53,711
哦,差不多嗯,
Oh, pretty much. Um,

69
00:06:53,796 --> 00:06:55,837
一旦罗伯逊介入此事，
once Mr Robertson became involved,

70
00:06:55,922 --> 00:06:58,079
他真的帮助我们推动了整个项目
he really helped us turbo-boost the whole project.

71
00:06:58,164 --> 00:06:59,891
实际上,谈论…

00:06:59,976 --> 00:07:03,031
-她知道了，Leo- 这很好

73
00:07:03,124 --> 00:07:05,194
Jo，这是一个转折点
This is a game-changer, Jo.

74
00:07:06,929 --> 00:07:09,843
它的安全性相当于iPhone
It's the security equivalent of the iPhone.

75
00:07:15,153 --> 00:07:17,061
我们私下谈谈好吗?
Shall we talk in private?

76
00:07:19,554 --> 00:07:22,594
我想让他们在我的选区里建造和测试
I want them built and beta tested in my constituency.

77
00:07:22,679 --> 00:07:24,391
是的，是的，正如讨论过的
Yes, yes, as discussed.

78
00:07:24,476 --> 00:07:26,147
当那些汽车公司抛弃你的时候
When those car firms deserted you,

79
00:07:26,232 --> 00:07:27,913
我买下了所有的植物
I bought up all the plants.

80
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,353
我现在拥有它们所以我们可以重新部署
I own them now. So we repurpose

81
00:07:31,647 --> 00:07:34,561
新的基础设施，新的就业机会

82
00:07:34,741 --> 00:07:37,187
这对你来说将是一场大胜利，Jo
This is going to be a big win for you, Jo.

83
00:07:37,272 --> 00:07:42,475
这是我们充满活力的新技术秘书制定的旗舰政策
A flagship policy from our dynamic new Technology Secretary

84
00:07:42,559 --> 00:07:44,335
它看起来，呃，

85
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,288
你们党很快就需要一个新领袖了
your party's going to need a new leader soon.

86
00:07:48,663 --> 00:07:51,250
他知道什么，小Leo?
What does he know, young Leo?

87
00:07:51,335 --> 00:07:53,795
我只知道零件是从某个未知的来源得来的
Only that I got the parts from some unknown source.

88
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:56,148
如果我给你通风报信的事被人知道
If it ever gets out that I tipped you off

89
00:07:56,233 --> 00:07:59,625
关于先进技术从GCHQ传送过来…

90
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:01,275
它不会
It won't.

92
00:08:03,718 --> 00:08:05,275
这是个很好的安排，Jo
This is a good arrangement, Jo.

93
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:08,601
你只是在促成收购
You're simply facilitating an acquisition

94
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:10,795
我也会把IP给你
and I'm cutting you in on the IP.

95
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,115
没有人知道
Nobody knows.

96
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:13,998
每个人都赢了
Everybody wins.

97
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:15,810
要花多长时间?
How long will it take?

98

大概一年吧
Er, a year, give or take.

99
00:09:02,259 --> 00:09:03,607

00:10:07,459 --> 00:10:10,953
相信我，你不能逃出去，我试过了
You can't eat the cage. Believe me, I've tried.

107
00:10:29,906 --> 00:10:31,601
睡前故事,博士?
Bedtime story, Doctor?

108
00:10:32,218 --> 00:10:33,828
是的,请,博士
Yes, please, Doctor.

109
00:10:34,382 --> 00:10:35,389
经典名著之一?
One of the classics?

110
00:10:35,474 --> 00:10:37,695
哦,是的,请
Ooh, yes, please.

111
00:10:39,304 --> 00:10:40,945
安定下来
Settle down, then.

112
00:10:43,921 --> 00:10:47,829
家住女贞路4号的德思礼夫妇自豪地说
"Mr and Mrs Dursley, of number four Privet Drive, were proud to say

113
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:50,234
“他们完全正常……”
"that they were perfectly normal..."

114
00:10:51,267 --> 00:10:52,562
什么?
What?

115
00:11:00,817 --> 00:11:02,273
那里是谁?
Who's there?

116
00:11:12,524 --> 00:11:13,891
保持强劲
Stay strong.

117
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,078
人们在等你
People are waiting for you.

118
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:52,196
我一直在思考她就在这里待了几分钟
I keep thinking. She was barely in here for a couple of minutes

119
00:11:52,281 --> 00:11:54,360
但她却把我们的DNA编码进了门锁，
and yet she coded the entry lock to our DNA,

120
00:11:54,445 --> 00:11:56,093
就像在她自己的塔迪斯
just like on her own TARDIS.

121
00:11:57,578 --> 00:11:58,696
也许,
Maybe,

122
00:11:58,781 --> 00:12:01,218
那是因为她希望我们能跟踪她，
that's cos she wanted us to be able to follow her,

123
00:12:01,413 --> 00:12:02,798
找到她,
to find her,

124
00:12:02,882 --> 00:12:04,595
因为她需要我们
cos she needed us.

125
00:12:04,882 --> 00:12:06,429
我要把它算出来
I'm going to work it out.

126
00:12:07,094 --> 00:12:09,265
我一定能解决这个问题
I must be able to work it out.

127
00:12:09,648 --> 00:12:11,254
新年快乐，Yaz
Happy New Year, Yaz.

128
00:12:14,062 --> 00:12:15,635
新年是什么时候?
When was it New Year?

129
00:12:16,281 --> 00:12:18,039
你睡在这里?
You been sleeping in here?

130
00:12:18,202 --> 00:12:19,482
也许吧
Maybe.

131
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:24,039
Yaz
Yaz,

132
00:12:24,124 --> 00:12:26,194
你不能一直待在这里
you can't keep being here all the time.

133
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:27,629
博士，你知道的，她去做了
The Doc, you know, she went to do

134
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:29,063
她知道的事可能会要了她的命
something she knew might kill her.

135
00:12:29,147 --> 00:12:30,741
我们只能假设她没能活下来
We've just got to assume she didn't make it.

136
00:12:30,825 --> 00:12:31,874
为什么?
Why?

137
00:12:33,421 --> 00:12:34,960
我们为什么要这样假设呢?
Why do we have to assume that?

138
00:12:35,049 --> 00:12:36,864
伙计，我们已经回来十个月了
Mate, we've been back ten months.

139
00:12:37,531 --> 00:12:38,960
我们得继续我们的生活
We have to get on with our lives.

140
00:12:39,147 --> 00:12:41,420
这是她告诉我们的这就是她想要的
That's what she told us. That's what she wanted for us.

141
00:12:42,226 --> 00:12:43,578
但如果她需要我们呢?
But what if she needs us?

142
00:12:43,663 --> 00:12:44,673
她救过我们多少次了?
How many times has she saved us?

143
00:12:44,757 --> 00:12:47,024
Yaz，面对现实吧，我们不知道怎么找到她
Yaz, face up to it, we don't know how to find her.

144
00:12:47,109 --> 00:12:48,275
好吧?
All right?

145
00:12:48,648 --> 00:12:50,218
还有一件事
And there's something else.

146
00:12:51,101 --> 00:12:52,718
-格雷厄姆，给她看看-嗯嗯
- Graham, show her. - Mm-hm.

147
00:12:55,085 --> 00:12:56,356
博士会很希望我们的
The Doc would really want us

148
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,085
监视这个星球，对吧?
to keep an eye on the planet, right?

149
00:12:58,241 --> 00:13:01,359
听着，这是泄露到网上的录像
Look, this is leaked online footage

150
00:13:01,445 --> 00:13:04,195
他们所谓的安全无人机原型
of what they're calling a prototype security drone.

151
00:13:04,452 --> 00:13:07,796
显然，这是一年前拍的只是看
Apparently, this was taken over a year ago. Just watch.

152
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:12,812
-那是戴立克-嗯嗯
- That's a Dalek. - Mm-hm.

153
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,843
但这怎么可能呢?
But how's that possible?

154
00:13:17,124 --> 00:13:19,413
不知道手表
No idea. Watch.

155
00:13:22,256 --> 00:13:23,585
杰克罗伯逊
Jack Robertson.

156
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:25,395
- 蜘蛛人毫米
- Spider guy. - Mm.

157
00:13:25,851 --> 00:13:27,281
他和戴立克是一伙的?
He's in league with a Dalek?

158
00:13:27,366 --> 00:13:29,062
这就是我们要查清楚的
That's what we're going to find out.

159
00:13:29,147 --> 00:13:31,710
如果她在这里，博士也会这么做，所以…
And that's what the Doc would do if she was here, so...

160
00:13:32,944 --> 00:13:34,710
. .你明白我们的意思吗?
..are you with us?

161
00:13:38,886 --> 00:13:41,638
这是我的荣幸
Well, it's an honour

162
00:13:41,723 --> 00:13:44,215
等待被首相召见
to be summoned by the Prime Minister in waiting...

163
00:13:45,372 --> 00:13:48,275
. .即使它有点，呃，乡野气息
..even if it is a bit, er, rural.

164
00:13:48,636 --> 00:13:50,714
离投票结果还有多少小时?
How many hours till we get the results from the ballots?

165
00:13:50,798 --> 00:13:52,674
数据都在我这边
The numbers are on my side.

166
00:13:53,122 --> 00:13:54,357
所以我才想跟你谈谈
That's why I wanted to talk.

167
00:13:54,442 --> 00:13:56,522
你不会对我们的协议有疑问吧?
You're not having doubts about our agreement, are you?

168
00:13:56,606 --> 00:13:58,044
恰恰相反
Quite the opposite.

169
00:13:58,637 --> 00:14:00,515
我想加快我们的项目
I want to expedite our project.

170
00:14:00,754 --> 00:14:03,677
英语中最甜蜜的六个字
Six of the sweetest words in the English language.

171
00:14:03,762 --> 00:14:07,154
我要你们立即在全国范围内部署无人机
I want an immediate national roll-out of security drones.

172
00:14:07,239 --> 00:14:08,512
国家吗?
National?

173
00:14:08,887 --> 00:14:11,974
但我们才刚刚开始区域测试
But we've only just started regional beta testing.

174
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,911
我希望英国纳税人不为此付出任何代价
And I want it at no cost to the British taxpayer.

175
00:14:16,003 --> 00:14:20,138
Jo，这听起来有点像勒索
Why, Jo, this is starting to sound like a shakedown.

176
00:14:20,223 --> 00:14:23,926
这个国家可以成为你全球销售的橱窗
This country can be your shop window for global sales.

177
00:14:24,801 --> 00:14:27,326
当然，除非你想让财政部看看
Unless, of course, you'd like the Treasury to take a look

178
00:14:27,411 --> 00:14:30,854
你们这里的公司要交多少税?

179
00:14:32,392 --> 00:14:36,911
啊好了……
Ah. Well played...

Leo?我在外面

三分钟
Three minutes.

184
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,430
哟还记得我们吗?
Yo. Remember us?

185
00:14:50,684 --> 00:14:53,715
把车!离开我的脸
Take the car! Just leave my face.

186
00:14:53,842 --> 00:14:55,122
什么?
What?

187
00:14:57,418 --> 00:14:59,301
哦,不!
Oh, no!

188
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:01,137
不是你们!
Not you guys!

189
00:15:01,231 --> 00:15:04,872
对，我们，因为我们知道你和戴立克的事
Yeah, us, cos we know all about you and that Dalek.

190
00:15:04,965 --> 00:15:07,115
什么?戴立克
The what? The Dalek.

191
00:15:07,356 --> 00:15:08,943
宇宙中最致命的生物
The most deadly creature in the universe.

192
00:15:09,027 --> 00:15:10,223
我们看见你拿着它
We saw you with it.

193
00:15:10,308 --> 00:15:12,084
你一直用的是什么词?
What is this word that you keep using?

194
00:15:12,169 --> 00:15:14,529
噢，别装无辜了!戴立克
Oh, don't play innocent! Dalek.

195
00:15:14,614 --> 00:15:16,482
不管你用它做什么，我们都会阻止你的
Whatever you're doing with it, we're going to stop you.

196
00:15:16,566 --> 00:15:19,176
举起手来!离车远点!
Hands in the air! Step away from the car!

197
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:21,529
怎么，你以为我不会加强安保吗
What, you didn't think I'd increase my security

198
00:15:21,614 --> 00:15:23,145
自从我们上次见面后?
since the last time we met?

199
00:15:24,277 --> 00:15:26,817
你们没死在地上算你们走运了
You're lucky you're not all dead on the ground.

200
00:15:27,989 --> 00:15:29,989
除掉他们，伙计们
Get rid of 'em, boys.

201
00:15:33,239 --> 00:15:35,754
跟计划的不太一样，对吧?
Well, that didn't go exactly to plan, did it?

202
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:37,421
我喜欢这句"不管你在做什么，
I like that whole "whatever you're doing,

203
00:15:37,505 --> 00:15:38,560
"我们会阻止你"的感觉
"we're going to stop you" vibe.

204
00:15:38,644 --> 00:15:40,731
- 非常Doctory-我这么做的时候没用
- Very Doctory. - Doesn't work when I do it.

205
00:15:40,816 --> 00:15:42,887
我们没有从他那里得到任何解释
We didn't get anywhere near an explanation from him.

206
00:15:43,093 --> 00:15:45,146
如果我们有博士的通灵纸
If we had the Doctor's psychic paper

207
00:15:45,231 --> 00:15:46,942
或者我们知道怎么对付塔迪斯，
or we knew how to work that TARDIS,

208
00:15:47,027 --> 00:15:49,301
我们可以去他办公室看看发生了什么事
we could get into his office and see what's going on.

209
00:15:50,698 --> 00:15:52,055
是啊，但我们不知道，所以我们要去
Yeah, but we don't, so we're going

210
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:53,373
还得想别的办法
to have to try and figure out another way.

211
00:15:53,457 --> 00:15:55,465
是的这很难，不是吗?
Yeah. This is hard, innit?

212
00:16:09,165 --> 00:16:10,794
早上好,相机38
Morning, camera 38.

213
00:16:25,239 --> 00:16:27,426
哦，我忘了你在这儿
Oh, I forgot you were here.

214
00:16:27,785 --> 00:16:29,223
这张脸怎么样?
What about this face?

215
00:16:31,158 --> 00:16:32,669
还记得这个吗?
Remember this?

216
00:16:34,605 --> 00:16:35,863
杰克?
Jack?

217
00:16:37,192 --> 00:16:38,223
杰克!
Jack!

218
00:16:38,308 --> 00:16:40,997
我就知道你穿这些颜色会比我好看
I knew you would look better in these colours than me.

219
00:16:41,211 --> 00:16:42,637
你好,博士
Hello, Doctor.

220
00:16:43,064 --> 00:16:44,184
你在这里做什么?
What are you doing here?

221
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:46,387
不然你以为我在这里干什么?打破你
What do you think I'm doing here? Breaking you out.

222
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,887
时间冻结门户去阻泡吸引人的,对吧?
Temporal-freezing gateway disinhibitor bubble. Catchy, right?

223
00:16:50,223 --> 00:16:53,176
换做是我，我会称之为突击手
If it were me, I'd have called it a breakout ball.

224
00:16:53,431 --> 00:16:55,965
暂时冻结时间，打破墙壁
Freezes time temporarily, breaks through walls.

225
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:57,473
唯一的问题是……
Only problem is...

226
00:16:57,793 --> 00:16:59,825
. .不会持续太久的
..it doesn't last long.

227
00:17:04,129 --> 00:17:05,958
- 你好!-你做过手术吗?
- Hi! - Have you had work done?

228
00:17:06,043 --> 00:17:07,399
你可以说话!
You can talk!

229
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:09,176
现在闭嘴跑吧
Now shut up and run.

230
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:14,385
我听说你在这里，所以我犯了几次罪
I heard a rumour you were in here, so I committed a few crimes.

231
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:16,987
也许是很多犯罪也许比我应该的要多
Well, maybe a lot of crimes. Maybe more than I should have.

232
00:17:17,072 --> 00:17:18,348
什么样的罪行?
What sort of crimes?

233
00:17:18,433 --> 00:17:19,469
- 左拐- 哦!
- Left turn. - Oh!

234
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:21,363
你要在我面前占据道德高地
You're going to take the moral high ground with me

235
00:17:21,447 --> 00:17:23,096
当我帮你越狱的时候?
when I'm breaking you out of prison?

236
00:17:23,181 --> 00:17:25,237
- 感恩!- 前门!
- Be grateful! - Front door!

237
00:17:25,322 --> 00:17:28,417
-这东西还剩多久?- 11秒后到期!
- How long has this thing got left? - 11 seconds till expiry!

238
00:17:30,165 --> 00:17:31,538
走吧!
Go!

239
00:17:34,835 --> 00:17:35,881
唷!
Phew!

240
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:38,566
花了19年才进到你旁边的牢房
Took 19 years to get to the cell next to you.

241
00:17:38,719 --> 00:17:40,343
希望你脑子里有足够的东西
Hope you had enough to occupy your mind.

242
00:17:40,428 --> 00:17:41,436
太多了
Too much.

243
00:17:41,521 --> 00:17:45,096
我们开始吧一个秘密藏起来的旋涡操纵器
Here we go. One secretly stashed vortex manipulator.

244
00:17:46,385 --> 00:17:49,726
不知道这需要多长时间我们得走了
Wondered how long that would take. We need to go now.

245
00:17:49,811 --> 00:17:51,671
你是怎么把它偷偷带进来的?
How did you manage to smuggle that in here?

246
00:17:51,756 --> 00:17:53,771
你真想让我回答吗?
You really want me to answer that?

247
00:17:54,358 --> 00:17:57,053
哦，我好想你……非常感谢
Oh, I've missed you... very much.

248
00:17:58,956 --> 00:18:00,396

运营、物流和生产都已纳入

每个人都被告知最大容量，最大速度，
Everyone has been told maximum capacity, maximum speed,

251
00:18:09,202 --> 00:18:11,413
而我们的贝塔搭档则通宵工作，
and our beta partners are working through the night,

252
00:18:11,498 --> 00:18:13,577
培训员工，在我们的主管-

253
00:18:13,662 --> 00:18:17,100
都是保密协议下的…当然可以

254
00:18:17,257 --> 00:18:19,301
我们认为我们可能有足够的……

255
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,726
. .嗯，为了赶上最后期限

256
00:18:21,861 --> 00:18:22,976
太好了
Great.

257
00:18:23,744 --> 00:18:26,513
伟大的工作,Leo这对我们有好处
Great job, Leo. This is going to be good for us.

258
00:18:26,676 --> 00:18:28,685
我忍不住有点…
I-I can't help but feel a little...

259
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:31,997
. .你知道的，我有点担心这事的进展速度
..well, you know, a little worried about the speed of this.

260
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:37,880
每个人都担心,Leo
Everybody's worried, Leo.

261
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:43,536
我们生活在一个不确定的时代你想赢吗?
We live in uncertain times. Do you want to win?

262
00:18:44,098 --> 00:18:45,982
拥抱不确定

00:18:46,185 --> 00:18:48,310
生活在忧虑中
Live in the worry.

264

00:18:51,379 --> 00:18:55,873
所以…有些事我想跟你说
So... there's-there's just something I-I needed to share

266
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:57,354
在这个项目中
on this project.

267
00:18:57,447 --> 00:18:59,583
我刚开始研究弹壳的时候，
When I first started working on that casing,

268
00:18:59,668 --> 00:19:02,064
我把它分解成最小的部分
I broke it down into the tiniest components.

269
00:19:02,149 --> 00:19:05,106
我的任务就是，了解它的一切
I made it my mission to, well, to understand everything about it.

270
00:19:05,191 --> 00:19:06,567
是的，你做得很好
Yes, and you did a great job.

271
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:08,473
这些机器将会改变
These machines are going to change

272
00:19:08,582 --> 00:19:10,723
- 世界-我说的不是机器
- the world. - I'm not talking about the machines.

273
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:14,304
我说的是原始藏物里面的东西
I'm talking about what was inside the original artefact.

274
00:19:14,428 --> 00:19:16,316
里面什么都没有，Leo
There's nothing inside, Leo.

275
00:19:16,401 --> 00:19:17,519
那是一个烧坏了的壳
It was a burnt-out shell.

276
00:19:17,604 --> 00:19:19,400
这就是我想告诉你的
Well, that's what I'm trying to tell you.

277
00:19:19,493 --> 00:19:21,690
我一直在做的细致调查，我…
This granular investigation I've been doing, I...

278
00:19:22,226 --> 00:19:25,062
. .我发现了更多的东西
..well, I found something more -

279
00:19:25,545 --> 00:19:28,381
机器内部的有机残留物，
organic remnants inside the machine,

280
00:19:28,465 --> 00:19:31,982
微小的细胞痕迹散布在弹壳上
tiny cellular traces scattered across the casing.

281
00:19:32,105 --> 00:19:33,941
你想说什么，Leo?
Where are you going with this, Leo?

282
00:19:34,025 --> 00:19:35,221
嗯…
Well...

283
00:19:35,305 --> 00:19:37,520
看,我居……我来演示给你们看
Look, I'll ju... I'll just show you.

284
00:19:42,678 --> 00:19:43,682
看
Look.

285
00:19:43,918 --> 00:19:45,409
就在这里,看到了吗?
Just here, see?

286
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,667
我查了手机信号，我…
I-I took the cellular traces and I...

287
00:19:49,448 --> 00:19:50,724
. .然后我克隆了它们
..and I cloned them.

288
00:19:50,838 --> 00:19:52,112
了他们
Grew them.

289
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:55,346
我培育了一个生物
I grew a creature.

290
00:19:58,362 --> 00:20:00,823
哦,我的上帝!
Oh, my God!

291
00:20:01,156 --> 00:20:03,552
-很漂亮，不是吗?- 不!
- It's beautiful, isn't it? - No!

292
00:20:04,363 --> 00:20:05,909
你疯了吗? !
Are you insane?!

293
00:20:06,225 --> 00:20:08,701
这是我这辈子见过的最恶心的事
That's the most disgusting thing I've ever seen in my life.

294
00:20:08,785 --> 00:20:10,261
你在想什么?
What were you thinking?

295
00:20:10,345 --> 00:20:12,128
什么?这是聪明的
What? It's intelligent.

296
00:20:12,213 --> 00:20:13,969
我把它接入了内部神经网络
I hooked it into the intra-neural network

297
00:20:14,187 --> 00:20:15,983
和…还有一些活动
and... and there were flickers of activity.

298
00:20:16,075 --> 00:20:17,589
它能立即理解我们的系统
It understood our systems immediately.

299
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:18,776
你做了什么? !
You did what?!

300
00:20:18,861 --> 00:20:20,464
好吧没有另一个词
All right. Not another word.

301
00:20:21,076 --> 00:20:22,753
你不自量力,Leo
You've overreached, Leo.

302
00:20:22,838 --> 00:20:25,794
我要你马上把它烧掉什么? !
I want this incinerated immediately. What?!

303
00:20:25,879 --> 00:20:27,195
没有理由!
No argument!

304
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,396
噢!
Ow!

305
00:20:28,985 --> 00:20:30,659
我不想看到任何痕迹
I don't want to see a trace of this.

306
00:20:30,744 --> 00:20:33,215
这从没发生过，你从没给我看过，
This never happened, you never showed it to me,

307
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,706
这东西根本不存在你明白吗?
this thing never existed. Do you understand?

308
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:37,307
好吧,好吧
OK, OK.

309
00:20:39,527 --> 00:20:41,443
你知道你的问题在哪吗，Leo?
You know what your problem is, Leo?

310
00:20:41,676 --> 00:20:43,050
你太聪明了
You're too clever.

311
00:20:43,945 --> 00:20:46,292
这就是为什么人们不喜欢专家
This is why people don't like experts.

312
00:21:24,505 --> 00:21:25,807
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

313
00:21:49,009 --> 00:21:50,049

317
00:22:03,081 --> 00:22:04,433

Stand.

324
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,597
良好的傀儡
Good puppet.

325
00:22:42,249 --> 00:22:43,683
我们出去
We're out.

326
00:22:48,143 --> 00:22:49,339
我回来了
I'm back.

327
00:22:53,445 --> 00:22:55,089
我自己的TARDIS
My own TARDIS.

328
00:23:00,322 --> 00:23:03,853
杰克·哈克尼斯船长，救援金星勋章

329
00:23:03,947 --> 00:23:06,385
我告诉过你的朋友如果你需要帮助，我会在你身边
Told your friends if you ever need help, I'd be there.

330
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:08,713
哇
Wow.

331
00:23:09,174 --> 00:23:11,072
这里升级得不错
Nice upgrade in here.

332
00:23:12,483 --> 00:23:13,759
我的房间往哪边走?
Which way's my room?

333
00:23:13,844 --> 00:23:15,986
你没有房间你从来没有过房间
You don't have a room. You've never had a room.

334
00:23:16,071 --> 00:23:19,471
我有一间带鸡尾酒会的套房
I had a suite with its own cocktail lounge.

335
00:23:20,635 --> 00:23:23,791
他们把我的信息告诉你了，关于那个孤独的赛博人?
They gave you my message, about the lone Cyberman?

336
00:23:23,876 --> 00:23:25,552
你没有给它网络空间?
You didn't give it the Cyberium?

337
00:23:25,644 --> 00:23:27,775
-说来话长我固定它- 什么?
- It's a long story. I fixed it. - What?

338
00:23:27,931 --> 00:23:29,096
最终
Eventually.

339
00:23:29,181 --> 00:23:30,947
差不多排序的
Just about. Sort of.

340
00:23:31,032 --> 00:23:32,846
你一开始为什么要进监狱?
Why were you in prison in the first place?

341
00:23:32,931 --> 00:23:35,267
逃避Judoon一次两次
Evading the Judoon. Twice at once.

342
00:23:35,377 --> 00:23:39,144
当我被录取后，他们又考虑了7000项其他罪行
Then once I was in, they took 7,000 other offences into consideration.

343
00:23:39,229 --> 00:23:41,056
他们7点就停了?
They stopped at seven?

344
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,762
我因为做我自己而进了监狱……
I was in prison for being me...

345
00:23:45,817 --> 00:23:48,611
. .就在我不确定那是什么意思的时候
..right at the point when I wasn't sure what that meant.

346
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:52,103
这几十年真是难熬啊
Ah, it's been a tough few decades.

347
00:23:52,204 --> 00:23:53,971
你现在没事了，是吗?
You're OK now, yeah?

348
00:23:55,531 --> 00:23:57,226
我想我们会知道的
Oh, I guess we'll find out.

349
00:23:58,222 --> 00:23:59,557
Wakey-wakey
Wakey-wakey.

350
00:24:00,771 --> 00:24:02,221
嘿!
Hey!

351
00:24:03,343 --> 00:24:04,799
好睡吗?
Nice nap?

352
00:24:05,853 --> 00:24:07,275
谢谢你的等待
Thanks for waiting.

353
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:10,396
我在那里有很多事要考虑
I had a lot to think about in there.

354
00:24:10,669 --> 00:24:12,842
还有三个我想念的特别的人
And three very special people I've missed.

355
00:24:12,927 --> 00:24:15,092
-其中一个就是我，对吧?-你从不改变
- One of them was me, right? - You never change.

356
00:24:15,177 --> 00:24:16,842
真希望我也能这么说
Wish I could say the same.

357
00:24:16,927 --> 00:24:18,326
正确的
Right.

358
00:24:18,639 --> 00:24:20,201
帮我找我的家人
Find me my fam.

359
00:24:21,688 --> 00:24:23,099
这是我目前得到的
This is what I've got so far.

360
00:24:23,584 --> 00:24:25,991
我们在GCHQ对抗的戴立克的残余

361
00:24:26,076 --> 00:24:28,066
无罪释放但后来被偷了
were cleared but then stolen.

362
00:24:28,629 --> 00:24:31,106
司机失踪了，估计已经死亡
The driver is missing, presumed dead.

363
00:24:31,192 --> 00:24:32,589
现在罗伯逊已经下手了
Now Robertson's got his hands on it.

364
00:24:32,673 --> 00:24:33,789
他不可能，
Well, he can't have,

365
00:24:33,961 --> 00:24:37,279
因为是你把里面的那个怪物送去的
because you sent that creature thing that was inside it

366
00:24:37,443 --> 00:24:38,905
变成超新星，所以…
into a supernova, so...

367
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:40,865
也许地球上还有更多
Maybe there's more of them here on Earth.

368
00:24:41,124 --> 00:24:43,099
其中一个控制了罗伯逊
And one's got Robertson under their control.

369
00:24:43,184 --> 00:24:45,154
瑞安,嘘!
Ryan, shh!

370
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,810
请
Please.

371
00:24:56,128 --> 00:24:57,503
请她
Please be her.

372
00:25:17,872 --> 00:25:19,528
这就跟你问声好！我在太空监狱
Hi! I was in space jail.

373
00:25:19,613 --> 00:25:20,842
你什么?
You what?

374
00:25:21,364 --> 00:25:22,800
猜猜是谁把她救出来的?
Guess who got her out?

375
00:25:22,885 --> 00:25:24,092
你们都见过杰克吧?
You all met Jack, right?

376
00:25:24,177 --> 00:25:25,670
嘿,银狐!
Hey, silver fox!

377
00:25:27,183 --> 00:25:28,310
你好
Hello.

378
00:25:29,178 --> 00:25:31,154
我们很担心你!
We were worried about you!

379
00:25:32,719 --> 00:25:34,357
什么?有多久了?
What? How long's it been?

380
00:25:35,616 --> 00:25:36,696
一个星期?
A week?

381
00:25:37,258 --> 00:25:38,568
两个星期吗?
Two weeks?

382
00:25:39,308 --> 00:25:40,623
十个月
Ten months.

383
00:25:42,896 --> 00:25:44,193
呃,哦!
Er, whoops!

384
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:45,349
不，不可能
No, it can't be.

385
00:25:45,433 --> 00:25:46,968
我设置了相同的时间坐标
I set identical temporal coordinates

386
00:25:47,053 --> 00:25:48,116
我送你回去的时候
to when I sent you back.

387
00:25:48,201 --> 00:25:49,804
是啊，但你的时间机器不是最好的
Yeah, but your time machine ain't the best

388
00:25:49,888 --> 00:25:51,435
在跑时间，是吗，博士?
at running to time, is it, Doc?

389
00:25:58,011 --> 00:25:59,291
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

390
00:26:00,834 --> 00:26:02,670
好吧，现在都结束了，所以…
Yeah, well, it's done now, so...

391
00:26:04,413 --> 00:26:05,493
是的
Yeah.

392
00:26:08,813 --> 00:26:09,849
所以…
So...

393
00:26:10,778 --> 00:26:12,358
. .地球上有什么新鲜事吗?
..what's new on planet Earth?

394
00:26:12,443 --> 00:26:13,928
戴立克
Dalek.

395
00:26:52,084 --> 00:26:53,646
前进
Forward.

396
00:26:53,849 --> 00:26:56,489
进一步进一步
Further. Further.

397
00:26:56,574 --> 00:26:58,045
这是什么地方?
What is this place?

398
00:26:59,776 --> 00:27:01,529
你做了什么?
What have you done?

399
00:27:06,582 --> 00:27:10,701
这是我的项目
This is my project.

400
00:27:11,652 --> 00:27:17,413
这是我建造的
This is what I have built.

401
00:27:17,685 --> 00:27:20,670
看起来像戴立克，但不可能是戴立克…
So, it looks like a Dalek, but it can't be a Dalek...

402
00:27:20,756 --> 00:27:22,241
. .除非他是戴立克!
..unless it is a Dalek!

403
00:27:22,326 --> 00:27:23,951
相信我们我们看过录像了
Trust us. We've seen the footage.

404
00:27:24,497 --> 00:27:26,779
如果你在地球上扫描戴立克的DNA
If you scan for Dalek DNA trace across the planet...

405
00:27:26,864 --> 00:27:29,060
-哦，她很好-是的，我们都是
- Oh, she's good. - Yeah, we all are.

406
00:27:29,631 --> 00:27:31,534
这么说，你也和戴立克打过交道?
So, you've had dealings with Daleks as well, then?

407
00:27:31,618 --> 00:27:34,506
是的，他们杀过我一次很久以前了，没什么大不了的
Yeah, they killed me once. Long time ago, no big deal.

408
00:27:34,591 --> 00:27:37,428
-作为一具尸体你看起来很健康-我知道，对吧?
- You look pretty healthy for a corpse. - I know, right?

409
00:27:37,592 --> 00:27:39,648
我可以被杀死，但我很快就会复活
I can be killed but I come back to life pretty quick.

410
00:27:39,732 --> 00:27:43,490
一部分是她的错，一部分是她在地球上的朋友罗斯
Partially her fault, partially a friend of hers on Earth called Rose.

411
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:46,060
但她现在被困在一个平行宇宙里了
But she's trapped in a parallel universe now.

412
00:27:46,162 --> 00:27:47,454
她是什么?
She's what?

413
00:27:47,622 --> 00:27:49,374
戴立克DNA追踪-日本
Dalek DNA trace - Japan.

414
00:27:49,638 --> 00:27:53,787
大阪嗯,有点不是完全匹配
Osaka. Well, sort of. Not an exact match.

415
00:27:54,004 --> 00:27:55,680
哦,它是损坏的
Oh, it's corrupted.

416
00:27:56,028 --> 00:27:58,419
我不太明白这是什么意思
I can't quite make sense of it.

417
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:01,076
我可以去看看有人要来吗?
I can check it out. Anyone want to come?

418
00:28:01,201 --> 00:28:02,414
我要!
I will!

419
00:28:02,693 --> 00:28:05,202
-我要和罗伯逊导演谈谈-我也是
- I want a word with Robertson direct. - Yeah, me too.

420
00:28:05,287 --> 00:28:07,574
看来他最近在大阪开了一家机构
Looks like he's recently opened a facility in Osaka.

421
00:28:07,658 --> 00:28:10,560
我们可以去看看，顺便送你过去
We could check it out, drop you on the way.

422
00:28:14,513 --> 00:28:16,670
每个人都在最大限度地工作
Everyone working at maximum capacity.

423
00:28:20,458 --> 00:28:22,380
呃…我回头打给你
Er... Let me call you back.

424
00:28:29,997 --> 00:28:33,224
如果你要对付戴立克，那你就太不自量力了
If you're dealing with Daleks, you are way out of your depth.

425
00:28:33,842 --> 00:28:35,038
那是什么东西?
What is that thing?

426
00:28:35,138 --> 00:28:36,974
我想知道你现在在干什么，
I want to know what you're doing right now,

427
00:28:37,058 --> 00:28:39,990
别打给保安，我刚把你的电话线给屏蔽了
and don't try calling security, cos I just blocked your phone lines.

428
00:28:40,075 --> 00:28:42,302
你们这些人到底怎么了?嗯?
What is the matter with you people? Hmm?

429
00:28:42,685 --> 00:28:45,422
你想知道我在干什么吗?我亲自给你看
Do you want to know what I'm doing? I'll show you myself.

430
00:28:53,032 --> 00:28:55,201
欢迎来到生产线
Welcome to the production line.

431
00:29:08,853 --> 00:29:10,568
你做戴立克
You're making Daleks.

432
00:29:15,549 --> 00:29:19,240
我们是3d打印安全无人机
We're 3D-printing security drones.

433
00:29:19,685 --> 00:29:23,125
-里面的东西呢?-里面什么都没有
- What about what's inside? - There's nothing inside.

434
00:29:23,218 --> 00:29:25,857
它是由人工智能运行的
It's run by artificial intelligence.

435
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:27,668
- 什么?- 看
- What? - Watch.

436
00:29:28,269 --> 00:29:29,385
看到了吗?
See?

437
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:31,060
他们的机器
They're machines.

438
00:29:31,633 --> 00:29:34,154
这是远程信号装置
There's the remote signal unit.

439
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:38,083
- 他们是空的-嗯嗯
- They're empty. - Mm-hm.

440
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:44,693
你在搅乱你不懂的东西
You're messing with things you don't understand.

441
00:29:44,778 --> 00:29:46,574
这些作品所模仿的生物
The creature these are modelled on

442
00:29:46,732 --> 00:29:49,951
是宇宙中最邪恶的杀人机器
is the most evil killing machine in the universe.

443
00:29:50,154 --> 00:29:55,014
你对一堆3d打印的形状太兴奋了
You're getting much too excited about a bunch of 3D-printed shapes.

444
00:29:55,138 --> 00:29:56,975
你在大阪的工厂里做什么?
So what are you doing at your facility in Osaka?

445
00:29:57,059 --> 00:29:58,815
(我们在大阪没有工厂)
We don't have a facility in Osaka.

446
00:29:58,932 --> 00:30:01,808
-是的，你知道-不，我们不知道!
- Yeah, you do. - No, we don't!

447
00:30:02,294 --> 00:30:03,639
我想知道
I would know.

448
00:30:03,724 --> 00:30:05,534
上面说这是一个农业园区
It says this is an agricultural park.

449
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,186
我猜这就是未来
Guess this is the future.

450
00:30:07,271 --> 00:30:09,454
- 嗯- 垂直农场都在里面
- Hmm. - Vertical farms. All inside.

451
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:12,107
在我那个年代，有很多像这样的农业行星，
In my time, there are whole agri-planets that look like this,

452
00:30:12,192 --> 00:30:14,548
把食物运送到星系的各个角落
shipping food all over galaxies.

453
00:30:14,757 --> 00:30:16,919
你的时间?第51个世纪
Your time? 51st century.

454
00:30:17,364 --> 00:30:18,560
滚开!
Get lost!

455
00:30:18,645 --> 00:30:20,641
认真对待Boeshane半岛
Seriously. Boeshane Peninsula.

456
00:30:20,731 --> 00:30:22,708
也许有一天我会带你去
Maybe one day I'll take you there.

457
00:30:24,515 --> 00:30:26,622
-他们都像你一样吗?- 没有
- Are they all like you there? - No.

458
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:28,599
我很特别
I'm pretty special.

459
00:30:31,154 --> 00:30:32,654
过得很艰难，是吗?
Had a rough time, then?

460
00:30:34,872 --> 00:30:36,734
没有看博士吗?
Without the Doctor?

461
00:30:37,138 --> 00:30:38,552
(我不明白你的意思)
I don't know what you mean.

462
00:30:40,068 --> 00:30:41,630
我看到你推她的样子了
I saw the way you shoved her.

463
00:30:44,047 --> 00:30:46,462
你以为她不会回来了，对吗?
You thought she wasn't coming back, right?

464
00:30:47,738 --> 00:30:49,534
你一推就猜了很多
You're guessing a lot from a shove.

465
00:30:50,395 --> 00:30:52,763
我自己也有跟博士打交道的经历
I have my own experience with the Doctor.

466
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:02,490
我刚好错过了她
I just missed her.

467
00:31:04,083 --> 00:31:06,490
-我从没想过…-嗨
- I never stopped to think... - Hey.

468
00:31:06,662 --> 00:31:08,387
我和博士在一起的时候，我看到
When I was with the Doctor, I-I saw

469
00:31:08,471 --> 00:31:10,473
比我想象的还要多
more than I could have ever dreamed.

470
00:31:11,808 --> 00:31:12,951
然后……
And then...

471
00:31:14,708 --> 00:31:16,264
. .我们失去了彼此
..we lost each other.

472
00:31:16,662 --> 00:31:18,208
我不知道他出了什么事
I didn't know what happened to him.

473
00:31:19,048 --> 00:31:20,743
如果他还活着或者…
If he was alive or...

474
00:31:23,888 --> 00:31:25,638
. .如果我还能再见到他
..if I was ever going to see him again.

475
00:31:29,622 --> 00:31:31,091
生活很艰难
Hard way to live.

476
00:31:34,751 --> 00:31:37,646
和博士在一起，你不能选择什么时候停止…
Being with the Doctor, you don't get to choose when it stops...

477
00:31:38,865 --> 00:31:40,708
. .你是要离开她还是…
..whether you leave her or...

478
00:31:41,948 --> 00:31:43,344
. .她离开你
..she leaves you.

479
00:31:44,021 --> 00:31:45,287
感觉残忍……
It felt cruel...

480
00:31:46,732 --> 00:31:49,271
. .让我看到我不能再拥有的东西
..to be shown something I couldn't have any more.

481
00:31:51,669 --> 00:31:54,974
我觉得，我还是不知道的好
Felt like, um, I'd rather not have known.

482
00:31:55,294 --> 00:31:58,412
我宁愿没有遇见她，因为遇见她之后…
I'd rather not have met her, cos having met her and then...

483
00:31:59,258 --> 00:32:01,255
. .没有她，那更糟
..being without her, that's worse.

484
00:32:02,685 --> 00:32:04,054
你是怎么处理的?
How do you deal with that?

485
00:32:04,419 --> 00:32:07,414
宇宙中有多少人能见到博士，
How many people in the universe get to meet the Doctor,

486
00:32:07,747 --> 00:32:09,349
更别说和她一起旅行了?
let alone travel with her?

487
00:32:10,818 --> 00:32:12,693
我们很幸运，Yaz
We're the lucky ones, Yaz.

488
00:32:15,106 --> 00:32:17,734
享受你的旅程
Enjoy the journey while you're on it.

489
00:32:20,665 --> 00:32:22,263
因为快乐……
Cos the joy...

490
00:32:25,378 --> 00:32:27,083
. .都是值得的
..is worth the pain.

491
00:32:38,195 --> 00:32:39,583
锁着的门
Locked door.

492
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,300
谢谢
Thanks.

493
00:32:51,896 --> 00:32:53,334
“谢谢”吗?
"Thanks"?

494
00:32:53,691 --> 00:32:54,891
就这些吗?
That's it?

495
00:32:56,115 --> 00:32:57,724
你是否感到没有安全感?
Are you feeling insecure?

496
00:32:58,029 --> 00:32:59,990
因为你似乎需要很多赞美
Cos you seem to need a lot of praise.

497
00:33:03,254 --> 00:33:04,310
我做了什么?
Do I?

498
00:33:05,449 --> 00:33:06,529
通过这里
Through here.

499
00:33:16,932 --> 00:33:18,283
这些事情
Those things.

500
00:33:18,658 --> 00:33:20,974
那是我们遇到的戴立克体内的东西
They were what was inside the Dalek we met.

501
00:33:21,331 --> 00:33:22,807
在每个戴立克
Inside every Dalek.

502
00:33:26,612 --> 00:33:28,214
这是一个克隆农场
This is a clone farm.

503
00:33:28,682 --> 00:33:30,753
他们不在这里种植食物，他们…
They're not growing food here, they're...

504
00:33:33,325 --> 00:33:35,002
. .他们培育戴立克
..they're growing Daleks.

505
00:33:42,618 --> 00:33:46,814
作为你们的新首相，我看到了巨大的机遇
As your new Prime Minister, I can see great opportunities ahead

506
00:33:46,898 --> 00:33:48,424
对这个国家
for this country.

507
00:33:49,377 --> 00:33:52,414
在英国，我们从未害怕过未来，
We here in Britain, we've never been afraid of the future,

508
00:33:52,627 --> 00:33:58,313
但我理解我们现在渴望的，是安全感
but I do understand that what we all crave right now, is security.

509
00:33:59,298 --> 00:34:01,734
我们的政治安全，
Security in our politics,

510
00:34:01,994 --> 00:34:03,854
我们工作的保障，
security in our jobs,

511
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:07,127
我们家庭的安全
security for our families.

512
00:34:08,578 --> 00:34:13,652
我保证，会带来稳定和安全
I pledge, to bring stability and security

513
00:34:13,737 --> 00:34:16,948
我们国民生活的方方面面
to every aspect of our national life.

514
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:23,268
我们一起努力，就能使这个时代成为安全的时代
Together, we can make this the age of security.

515
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:25,533
这里发生了什么?
What's happening here?

516
00:34:26,533 --> 00:34:27,980
我们到底在做什么?
What are we actually doing?

517
00:34:28,065 --> 00:34:29,534
去大阪-快!
Going to Osaka - fast!

518
00:34:30,243 --> 00:34:31,361
怎么样?
What about...?

519
00:34:31,446 --> 00:34:33,433
这个蓝色的盒子怎么样?
What about this blue box?

520
00:34:33,518 --> 00:34:36,455
-怎么了?- 这是一个……这是一个门?
- What is it? - It's a... It's a doorway?

521
00:34:37,298 --> 00:34:38,580
这不可能
It can't be.

522
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,456
那是我的走廊
That was my hallway.

523
00:34:40,541 --> 00:34:41,682
我不明白你的意思
I don't understand.

524
00:34:41,767 --> 00:34:43,057
我们要不要跟他解释一下?
Should we explain it to him?

525
00:34:43,142 --> 00:34:45,066
不，看他挣扎更有趣
No, it's more fun watching him struggle.

526
00:34:45,151 --> 00:34:47,614
虽然你很难理解，但这不是你的事
As hard as it is for you to understand, this isn't about you.

527
00:34:47,698 --> 00:34:48,814
这是为了戴立克
This is about Daleks.

528
00:34:48,898 --> 00:34:51,612
请不要再用那个词了它没有任何意义
Please stop using that word. It has no meaning.

529
00:34:51,948 --> 00:34:53,654
是的,确实
Yes, it does.

530
00:34:53,971 --> 00:34:57,014
对数十亿人来说，戴立克意味着仇恨
To billions of people, Dalek means hate.

531
00:34:57,385 --> 00:35:00,190
戴立克是充满仇恨和攻击性的生物
Daleks are creatures of hate and aggression.

532
00:35:00,323 --> 00:35:03,294
戴立克阴险无情又聪明
Daleks are insidious, relentless and clever,

533
00:35:03,378 --> 00:35:06,374
而且，就像仇恨一样，如果不加以制止，它们就会扩散
and, like hate, they will spread if they're not stopped.

534
00:35:06,526 --> 00:35:08,924
永远不要低估戴立克
Never underestimate a Dalek.

535
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:12,487
所以我今天才要揭牌吗
Which is why I am unveiling today

536
00:35:12,705 --> 00:35:17,627
这是一个非常令人兴奋的老问题的新解决方案

537
00:35:18,088 --> 00:35:24,901
我们将利用技术革命来提高您的安全

538
00:35:25,578 --> 00:35:29,774
我们会减轻警察和保安人员的压力
We will alleviate pressure on police and security staff

539
00:35:30,033 --> 00:35:33,313
这一切都没有掏空公众的钱包
and all without draining the public purse.

540
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,432
Oi !
Oi!

541
00:35:46,745 --> 00:35:49,433
你能快点帮我吗?
Can you hurry up and help me with this?

542
00:35:49,518 --> 00:35:51,294
我需要提取液体的样本
I need to take a sample of the liquid.

543
00:35:51,494 --> 00:35:53,487
我想知道它吃的是什么
I want to know what it's being fed on.

544
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,331
也许能给我们一些阻止他们的线索
Might give us a clue on how to stop 'em.

545
00:35:55,416 --> 00:35:57,658
嗯我们要把他们炸了，孩子
Huh. We're going to blow 'em up, kid.

546
00:35:58,572 --> 00:36:00,213
这样才能阻止他们
That's how we stop 'em.

547
00:36:30,124 --> 00:36:31,324
杰克!
Jack!

548
00:36:46,191 --> 00:36:47,387
把它拿开!
Get it off me!

549
00:36:47,733 --> 00:36:50,514
站着不动!,别动!
Stand still! Yaz, don't move!

550
00:36:57,638 --> 00:36:58,709
漂亮的照片
Nice shot.

551
00:36:58,794 --> 00:37:03,156
到现在为止，你会看到新的防御无人机在工作
As of now, you will see new defence drones at work

552
00:37:03,241 --> 00:37:05,073
英国的街道上……
on Britain's streets...

553
00:37:06,272 --> 00:37:09,538
. .在我们的机构里，在我们的边界…
..in our institutions, at our borders...

554
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:12,663

555
00:37:13,194 --> 00:37:17,050
这些技术革新是既定的

556
00:37:17,581 --> 00:37:20,722
让英国更安全
to make Britain more secure.

557
00:37:38,779 --> 00:37:40,323
你确实喜欢无檐帽
You do love a beanie.

558
00:37:42,156 --> 00:37:43,276
我也是
Me too.

559
00:37:44,831 --> 00:37:47,374
我们相遇那晚，我注意到你的第一件事
One of the first things I noticed about you that night we met.

560
00:37:47,886 --> 00:37:50,094
我想，不是每个人都能拿着黄色的无檐帽
I thought, "Not everyone can carry off a yellow beanie.

561
00:37:50,178 --> 00:37:52,026
“有个小伙子可以依靠”
"There's a lad to rely on."

562
00:37:56,526 --> 00:37:58,214
4分钟到大阪

563
00:37:58,448 --> 00:37:59,898

566
00:38:13,618 --> 00:38:15,995
我的遗憾无以言表
More sorry than I can ever really say.

567
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:25,901
这个东西,不是吗?你从来没有真正掌握它的窍门
This thing, innit? You never really quite got the hang of it.

568
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:29,519
我想念你们……
I missed you all...

569
00:38:31,218 --> 00:38:32,972

是的，他又回石油钻塔去了

在地球上有很多工作要做

00:39:14,822 --> 00:39:17,058
听起来你很享受回来的感觉
Well, it sounds like you enjoyed being back.

586
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:21,839
它的家
It's home.

587
00:39:25,105 --> 00:39:26,465
是的
Yeah.

588
00:39:28,112 --> 00:39:29,364
你的家怎么了?
What's happening with your home?

589
00:39:29,448 --> 00:39:32,050
你在伽里弗雷上发生了什么?
You know, what happened to you on Gallifrey?

590
00:39:34,065 --> 00:39:35,753
那里所有的生命都被毁灭了
All life there destroyed.

591
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:39,769
多亏了死亡粒子和柯·沙莫斯
Thanks to the death particle and Ko Sharmus.

592
00:39:40,178 --> 00:39:42,449
和主吗?他找你干什么?
And the Master? What did he want with you?

593
00:39:42,534 --> 00:39:44,785
现在都不重要了不,不,不
It doesn't even matter now. No, no, no.

594
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:47,614
别跟我胡扯对吧?我知道你在做什么
Don't give me that. Right? I see what you're doing.

595
00:39:47,698 --> 00:39:49,454
你在试图回避这个话题
You're trying to avoid the subject.

596
00:39:49,894 --> 00:39:51,294
我们已经认识够久了
We've known each other long enough now.

597

我知道什么时候发生了变化
I know when something's changed.

598
00:39:54,786 --> 00:39:56,073
我也是
Me too.

599
00:40:05,465 --> 00:40:07,581
我不是我以为的那个人，莱恩
I'm not who I thought I was, Ryan.

600
00:40:09,138 --> 00:40:12,987
我一直知道的我生命的故事…
What I always knew to be the story of my life...

601
00:40:14,019 --> 00:40:15,594
. .不是真实的
..isn't true.

602
00:40:16,816 --> 00:40:18,414
我不是在伽里弗雷出生的
I wasn't born on Gallifrey.

603
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,824
我的家乡，我的生活，
Where I'm from, all the lives I've lived,

604
00:40:21,909 --> 00:40:25,550
有些事一直瞒着我，我甚至不知道到底有多少
some of that has been hidden from me, and I don't even know how much.

605
00:40:26,026 --> 00:40:27,230
严重吗?
Seriously?

606
00:40:28,886 --> 00:40:30,644
你对此有何感想?
And how do you feel about that?

607
00:40:32,143 --> 00:40:33,423
主要是…
Mostly...

608
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:36,814
. .生气
..angry.

609
00:40:37,308 --> 00:40:41,300
当我被关起来的时候，我一直在想…
While I was locked away, all I kept thinking, was...

610
00:40:43,542 --> 00:40:47,223
“如果我不是我想的那样，那我是谁?”
"If I'm not who I thought I was, then who am I?"

611
00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:48,745
你是博士
You're the Doctor.

612
00:40:48,925 --> 00:40:51,089
一如既往，一如既往
Same as before, same as always.

613
00:40:51,598 --> 00:40:53,314
正确的
Right.

614
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:56,071
同样的博士，同样的瑞恩
Same Doctor, same Ryan.

615
00:40:57,605 --> 00:40:59,094
什么都没有改变
Nothing's changed.

616
00:40:59,448 --> 00:41:00,854
不不
No. No.

617
00:41:01,081 --> 00:41:02,673
我没那么说，对吧?
I didn't say that, did I?

618
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:09,347
事情一直在变化，
Things change all the time,

619
00:41:09,542 --> 00:41:11,683
他们应该这么做，因为他们必须这么做
and they should, cos they have to.

620
00:41:11,933 --> 00:41:13,550
与人相同
Same with people.

621
00:41:14,065 --> 00:41:18,840
有时候我们会有点害怕，因为新来的人会有点害怕，对吧?
Sometimes we get a bit scared, cos new can be a bit scary, right?

622
00:41:21,218 --> 00:41:23,519
新东西会很吓人
New can be very scary.

623
00:41:24,316 --> 00:41:26,362
等我们解决了戴立克的问题，
So, when we're done with this Dalek problem,

624
00:41:26,978 --> 00:41:28,917
你发现了自己的生活
you find out about your own life.

625
00:41:30,578 --> 00:41:32,855
面对新事物或旧事物
Confront the new, or the old.

626
00:41:34,109 --> 00:41:36,808
然后一切都会好起来的
And then everything will be all right.

627
00:41:38,618 --> 00:41:40,868
- MWill吗?- 毫无疑问
- MWill it? - No doubt.

628
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,933
什么?
What?

629
00:41:47,018 --> 00:41:48,508
谢谢你,瑞恩……
Thank you, Ryan...

630
00:41:50,465 --> 00:41:52,280
. .感谢你做我的朋友
..for being my friend.

631
00:41:54,164 --> 00:41:55,797
谢谢你成为我的人
Thank you for being mine.

632
00:41:56,759 --> 00:41:57,999
总是这样
Always.

633
00:42:03,418 --> 00:42:04,766
大阪
Osaka.

634
00:42:09,647 --> 00:42:13,686
Oh-ho-ho !我错过了那个声音
Oh-ho-ho! I've missed that sound.

635
00:42:20,182 --> 00:42:21,382
哇!
Whoa!

636
00:42:22,458 --> 00:42:24,254
等等，刚才发生了什么?
Wait, what just happened?

637
00:42:24,405 --> 00:42:26,294
还是不告诉他?不
Still not telling him? No.

638
00:42:26,491 --> 00:42:27,854
我在哪儿?
Where am I?

639
00:42:27,938 --> 00:42:29,663
你一定要带他来吗?
Did you really have to bring him?

640
00:42:29,748 --> 00:42:31,241
- Yaz !- 格雷厄姆
- Yaz! - Graham.

641
00:42:32,155 --> 00:42:34,585
哦，那些是什么东西?
Oh, what are those things?

642
00:42:34,732 --> 00:42:36,647
住在戴立克体内的生物
The creatures that live inside Daleks.

643
00:42:36,733 --> 00:42:38,334
但这一切是谁建造的?
But who built all this?!

644
00:42:38,418 --> 00:42:40,085
我有
I have.

645
00:42:42,749 --> 00:42:45,171
Leo?别靠得太近!
Leo? Don't get too close!

646
00:42:45,328 --> 00:42:47,210
我警告过你的
I warned you about that thing.

647
00:42:47,298 --> 00:42:48,764
你做了什么，Leo?
What have you done, Leo?

648
00:42:49,058 --> 00:42:52,874
克隆出最小的有机物质，
Cloned the smallest trace of organic material,

649
00:42:53,077 --> 00:42:55,336
不理解戴立克的意识
not understanding that Dalek consciousness

650
00:42:55,421 --> 00:42:58,084
能活在他们DNA中最微小的片段里
can live within the tiniest fragment of their DNA.

651
00:42:58,194 --> 00:42:59,414
你不知道
You weren't to know.

652
00:42:59,514 --> 00:43:01,195
你是安全的我们为你而来
You're safe. We're here for you.

653
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,688
我们会把你活着救出去的
We're going to get you out of here alive.

654
00:43:02,772 --> 00:43:05,062
你给了这具尸体错误的希望
You give this body false hope.

655
00:43:05,147 --> 00:43:08,343
好吧，戴立克，不管你是谁，
All right, then, Dalek, or whatever you are,

656
00:43:09,218 --> 00:43:10,600
告诉我这一切是怎么来的
tell me how you've built all this.

657
00:43:10,685 --> 00:43:13,952
我把自己接入了神经网络
I connected myself into the neural network.

658
00:43:14,178 --> 00:43:18,901
我融入了这个组织，融入了每一个网络
I inserted myself into the organisation, into every network.

659
00:43:19,289 --> 00:43:22,335
我找到了这个地方，创造了它
I located this place, created it.

660
00:43:22,892 --> 00:43:27,358
每一件设备，背后的每一个想法…
Every piece of equipment, every idea behind it...

661
00:43:28,898 --> 00:43:30,494
. .我这么做
..I did that.

662
00:43:30,655 --> 00:43:32,574
等一下首先，这不可能
Wait a minute. First of all, that's not possible.

663
00:43:32,658 --> 00:43:35,174
你从哪里得到采购订单号的?
Where did you get the purchase order numbers in the first place?

664
00:43:35,258 --> 00:43:37,454
真的吗，你现在最烦的就是这个吗?
Really, that's what's bugging you most right now?

665
00:43:37,538 --> 00:43:41,654
我用你们的系统买了这栋楼，订购了设备，
I used your systems to buy this building, to order equipment,

666
00:43:41,738 --> 00:43:46,226
付钱给人类建造并继续克隆人的工作
to pay humans to construct and to continue the clone work.

667
00:43:46,311 --> 00:43:51,718
我用你们的系统建立了一支以我为原型的军队
I used your systems to build an army all in my image.

668
00:43:51,818 --> 00:43:53,408
但是工人在哪里呢?
But where are the workers?

669
00:43:53,877 --> 00:43:55,853
做克隆的人在哪里?
Where are the people who did all the cloning?

670
00:43:55,938 --> 00:43:59,873
一旦实验成功，它们就变成了……
Once the experiments were working, they became...

671
00:44:01,182 --> 00:44:02,837
不必要的
..unnecessary.

672
00:44:03,618 --> 00:44:06,057
我们发现了它们的另一个用途
We found them another use.

673
00:44:09,319 --> 00:44:13,518
怎么，你在喂克隆人戴立克吗?
What, you're feeding cloned Dalek creatures liquidised humans?

674
00:44:14,578 --> 00:44:15,814
正确的
Correct.

675
00:44:15,898 --> 00:44:17,614
这是公关灾难
This is a PR disaster.

676
00:44:18,314 --> 00:44:20,236
但还有一件事困扰着我
But there's something else that's bugging me.

677
00:44:20,767 --> 00:44:22,518
它是什么?是因为灯光吗?
What is it? Is it the light?

678
00:44:22,603 --> 00:44:25,174
自从我们来到这里，光线就一直变化得很慢
The light's been changing really slowly ever since we've been here.

679
00:44:25,258 --> 00:44:27,517
-是的谢谢,Yaz-我想你，Yaz
- Yes, it is. Thanks, Yaz. - I missed you, Yaz.

680
00:44:27,705 --> 00:44:29,439
为什么这很重要?
Right, why is that important?

681
00:44:29,564 --> 00:44:31,705
-发生的事太多了-我说到哪儿了?
- Oh, there's too much going on. - Where was I?

682
00:44:32,067 --> 00:44:34,189
是的你打算怎么离开这个星球?
Yes. How are you going to get off this planet?

683
00:44:34,274 --> 00:44:35,697
我们不会
We will not.

684
00:44:35,782 --> 00:44:36,818
我很抱歉?
I'm sorry?

685
00:44:36,903 --> 00:44:40,166
地球是我们的它将被转换
The planet is ours. It will be converted.

686
00:44:40,258 --> 00:44:41,753
转换成什么?
Converted into what?

687
00:44:41,838 --> 00:44:43,713
我们要把这个星球当作基地
We shall use this planet as a base

688
00:44:43,798 --> 00:44:47,002
以此来征服宇宙的这一部分
from which to conquer this sector of the universe.

689
00:44:47,178 --> 00:44:49,574
蹲在日本的实验室里还有很长的路要走
There's a long way between squatting in a Japanese lab

690
00:44:49,658 --> 00:44:50,894
人类和征服
and subjugating humanity.

691
00:44:50,978 --> 00:44:52,414
我是说，你连身体都没有
I mean, you don't even have bodies.

692
00:44:52,498 --> 00:44:54,673
你打算做什么？从你的坦克里命令人?
What are you going to do? Order people from your tanks?

693
00:44:54,851 --> 00:44:58,283
即使你在下面找到了那些炮弹，你也做不到
Even if you made it to those shells down there, which you can't.

694
00:45:00,361 --> 00:45:01,486
你不能
You can't.

695
00:45:01,571 --> 00:45:03,978
我是说，你绝对不能…
I mean, you definitely can't. The...

696
00:45:04,925 --> 00:45:08,165
这些炮弹甚至都不是武器他们不是真正的戴立克
Those shells aren't even weaponised. They're not proper Daleks.

697
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:10,545
-是他造的-博士…
- He built them. - Doctor...

698
00:45:11,447 --> 00:45:12,934
. .有什么事吗?
..what's the matter?

699
00:45:13,314 --> 00:45:14,947
光
The light.

700
00:45:15,431 --> 00:45:17,854
这些炮弹是在他的工厂里制造的
The shells were built in his factories.

701
00:45:18,009 --> 00:45:21,026
你以为我没有扩充那些设计吗?
Do you think I've not augmented those designs also?

702
00:45:21,111 --> 00:45:23,414
光在哪里?我们得把灯关掉!
Where's the light? We have to turn off the light!

703
00:45:23,498 --> 00:45:24,534
为什么,博士?
Why, Doctor?

704
00:45:24,618 --> 00:45:25,774
紫外线
Ultraviolet light.

705
00:45:25,858 --> 00:45:28,220
侦察戴立克用它重新团结起来
The Recon Dalek used it to come back together.

706
00:45:28,305 --> 00:45:29,785
激活!
Activate!

707
00:45:31,667 --> 00:45:34,291
我的计划将会完成
My project shall be complete.

708
00:45:40,713 --> 00:45:44,689
新的戴立克军队只有一个目的
The New Dalek Army shall have but one purpose.

709
00:45:50,829 --> 00:45:52,990
消灭!
Exterminate!

710
00:46:00,370 --> 00:46:02,611
消灭!
Exterminate!

711
00:46:25,275 --> 00:46:27,853
看起来是有一些初期的问题
It appears that there are some teething issues with

712
00:46:27,938 --> 00:46:29,334
…无人机,
the... with the drones,

713
00:46:29,418 --> 00:46:32,509
所以我呼吁大家保持冷静
so I appeal to everybody to keep calm.

714
00:46:32,822 --> 00:46:34,956
无人机完全在我们的控制之下，
The drones are completely under our control,

715
00:46:35,041 --> 00:46:37,316
-所以我们在努力关闭它们…- 领土领袖
- so we're working to shut them down... - Territorial leader

716
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:38,893
识别
identified.

717
00:46:38,978 --> 00:46:41,390
戴立克不会被关闭的
Daleks will not be shut down.

718
00:46:41,475 --> 00:46:43,268
戴立克是最高的
Daleks are supreme.

719
00:46:43,353 --> 00:46:44,519
这一定是在开玩笑
This must be some sort of a joke.

720
00:46:44,603 --> 00:46:46,614
戴立克可不会开玩笑
Daleks do not joke.

721
00:46:46,705 --> 00:46:49,773
-我不会投降- 消灭!
- And I do not surrender. - Exterminate!

722
00:46:49,898 --> 00:46:53,877
这片土地属于戴立克
This territory is the property of the Daleks.

723
00:46:53,962 --> 00:46:56,079
戴立克控制了一切
Daleks are in control.

724
00:46:56,164 --> 00:47:00,087
所有的人类都将被消灭
All humanity will be exterminated.

725
00:47:00,594 --> 00:47:02,744
-你造了多少戴立克?-我也不知道
- How many Daleks did you build? - Look, I don't know.

726
00:47:02,829 --> 00:47:04,165
- 有多少?- 成千上万!
- How many?! - Thousands!

727
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:05,490
停止
Stop.

728
00:47:07,738 --> 00:47:09,054
你没必要杀他
You don't have to kill him.

729
00:47:09,138 --> 00:47:10,374
正确的
Correct.

730
00:47:10,458 --> 00:47:13,993
我不需要，但是…
I do not have to, and yet...

731
00:47:23,256 --> 00:47:24,576
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

732
00:47:28,726 --> 00:47:30,366
哦,Leo!
Oh, Leo!

733
00:47:31,789 --> 00:47:34,954
没有武器没时间想了
No weapons. No time to think.

734
00:47:35,991 --> 00:47:39,758
在牢房里待了那么久，想知道我是谁
All that time in a cell wondering who I am.

735
00:47:41,138 --> 00:47:42,618
我是博士
I'm the Doctor.

736
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:44,954
我是阻止戴立克的人
I'm the one who stops the Daleks.

737
00:47:45,852 --> 00:47:48,618
所有人，去塔迪斯!
All of you, to the TARDIS now!

738
00:47:48,978 --> 00:47:51,969
我只能想到一件事核选项
Only one thing I can think of. Nuclear option.

739
00:47:54,618 --> 00:47:58,166
核选项可能会适得其反
Nuclear option that might backfire.

740
00:47:58,251 --> 00:47:59,775
如果我觉得你是这么想的，
If it's what I think you're thinking,

741
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:01,822
你现在最好别再想了
you'd better stop thinking it right now.

742
00:48:01,907 --> 00:48:03,414
这风险太大了
Way too big a risk.

743
00:48:03,498 --> 00:48:05,414
-风险有多大?- Planet-threatening
- How big a risk? - Planet-threatening.

744
00:48:05,498 --> 00:48:07,718
有更好的主意吗?因为现在是你的时刻
Got any better ideas? Cos now is your moment.

745
00:48:07,803 --> 00:48:09,458
我洗耳恭听
I'm all ears.

746
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,314
- 嗯- 到底!
- Mmm. - Exactly!

747
00:48:12,399 --> 00:48:13,844
那你打算怎么做?
So, what is it you're going to do?

748
00:48:13,929 --> 00:48:16,704
它们是由最初的侦察戴立克建造的
They're built from the original Reconnaissance Dalek.

749
00:48:17,938 --> 00:48:20,438
我要把他们想要的给他们
I'm going to give them what they wanted in the first place.

750
00:48:24,313 --> 00:48:27,393
-她在干什么?-你永远不想做的事
- What's she doing? - Something you never want to do.

751
00:48:42,393 --> 00:48:43,651
博士，你做了什么?
Doc, what have you done?

752
00:48:43,778 --> 00:48:46,254
通过时间线向漩涡发送了一条信息，
Sent a message through the timelines into the vortex,

753
00:48:46,722 --> 00:48:49,928
因为我知道它们在里面，就像水里的鲨鱼
cos I know they're in there, like sharks in water.

754
00:48:51,185 --> 00:48:53,925
总是确定范围，总是准备好
Always scoping, always ready.

755
00:49:04,135 --> 00:49:07,439
探测到来袭的侦察信号
Incoming reconnaissance signal detected.

756
00:49:07,617 --> 00:49:09,166
Strategise !
Strategise!

757
00:49:09,370 --> 00:49:11,774
“地球目的地”计划
Programme destination for Earth.

758
00:49:11,873 --> 00:49:15,078
预料会有抵抗!
Resistance must be expected!

760
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:21,894
谁在那里?
Who's in there?

761
00:49:21,978 --> 00:49:24,458
你永远不想看到的飞船到达了你的星球
The ship you never want to see arriving on your planet.

762
00:49:24,543 --> 00:49:26,637
-里面有什么?-敢死队戴立克
- What's on it? - Death Squad Daleks.

763
00:49:26,722 --> 00:49:28,681
就当他们是戴立克的特种空勤团

764
00:49:28,766 --> 00:49:31,613
-只会更残忍-现在他们是我们最大的希望

765
00:49:31,698 --> 00:49:33,214
但他们会杀更多的人类

766
00:49:33,298 --> 00:49:34,950
他们不关心人类

767
00:49:35,094 --> 00:49:37,413
他们是戴立克种族的执行者
They're the enforcers of the Dalek race.

768
00:49:37,498 --> 00:49:39,543
为了对抗戴立克，你带来了更多戴立克?
To combat Daleks, you've brought more Daleks?

769
00:49:39,639 --> 00:49:42,279
是的，但他们不知道我在后面，
Yes, but they don't know that I'm behind the transmission,

770
00:49:42,364 --> 00:49:44,973
让他们不知道我在这里，这很重要
and it's quite important that they don't realise I'm here.

771
00:49:45,161 --> 00:49:46,894
我们有之前我们不是最好的朋友
We've got previous. We're not best mates.

772

好吧，如果你的计划成功了
All right, look, so if your plan works

773
00:49:49,301 --> 00:49:51,254
而这群戴立克杀死了他的同类…

774
00:49:51,338 --> 00:49:53,240
-这不是我的命-谢谢
- It's not my lot. - Thank you.

775
00:49:53,325 --> 00:49:54,694
. .我们要怎么摆脱新的?

00:49:54,778 --> 00:49:56,974
这是计划的第二阶段就靠我们了
That's phase two of the plan. It'll be down to us.

00:49:57,058 --> 00:49:59,701
虚弱的人类，不要跑!
Feeble humans, do not run!

778
00:49:59,786 --> 00:50:02,629
你们的身体对戴立克来说太慢了!
Your bodies are too slow for Daleks!

779
00:50:02,864 --> 00:50:05,951
戴立克控制了这片领土!

00:50:16,863 --> 00:50:22,311
没有什么能阻止新戴立克军队的霸权!

停止呆在那儿别动!

793
00:51:06,094 --> 00:51:08,534
-现在是戴立克在控制!- 控制!

794
00:51:08,619 --> 00:51:10,224
在控制!

795
00:51:10,309 --> 00:51:13,042
戴立克已经掌控了一切

确定!
Identify!

797
00:51:15,049 --> 00:51:16,113
戴立克!
Dalek!

798
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:19,588
不正确的扫描检测异常

戴立克的DNA和人类的痕迹融合了

800

我们为了生存而变异

805
00:51:45,414 --> 00:51:46,850
这就是戴立克的特点
That's the thing about Daleks.

806
00:51:46,934 --> 00:51:50,250
作为一个由基因突变而来的种族，他们对纯洁性非常着迷

807
00:51:50,334 --> 00:51:51,916
所有的产品

808
00:51:52,118 --> 00:51:54,470

是的
Yes.

823
00:52:40,138 --> 00:52:42,014
我是你最好的盟友
And I'm your best ally here.

824
00:52:42,099 --> 00:52:44,908
戴立克不需要盟友
Daleks do not need allies.

825
00:52:44,993 --> 00:52:47,449
我知道地球是怎么运转的
I know how the Earth works.

826
00:52:47,612 --> 00:52:49,166
我有信息

827

戴立克不需要人类的指导
Daleks have no need of guidance from humans.

00:52:56,177 --> 00:52:58,013
你是不重要的
You are unimportant.

830
00:52:58,098 --> 00:53:03,546
我知道你会这么想，但是，我不是普通人
I can see how you might think that, but, er, I'm no ordinary human.

831
00:53:03,631 --> 00:53:07,387
我们要摧毁戴立克的杂质!
We shall destroy Dalek impurities!

832
00:53:07,504 --> 00:53:09,100
当然可以
Of course.

833
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:10,967
但当你做完这些，
But when you're done with that,

834
00:53:11,052 --> 00:53:13,155
你也会想要这个星球的，对吧?
you're going to want the planet too, right?

835
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:17,695
你不觉得你的戴立克同伴会接受吗?
Don't you think that would go down well with your fellow Daleks?

836
00:53:21,647 --> 00:53:24,546
你要背叛自己的种族?
You would betray your own race?

837
00:53:24,777 --> 00:53:27,702
你要背叛人类?
You would betray humanity?

838
00:53:27,787 --> 00:53:29,030
确定

解释!
Explain!

842
00:53:35,841 --> 00:53:38,694
首先，我想认识一下这里的负责人
First, I want to meet who's in charge here.

843
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:43,694
换句话说，带我去见你们的领袖
In other words, take me to your leader.

844
00:53:44,562 --> 00:53:46,758
计划的第一阶段正在进行

戴立克摧毁其他戴立克

846
00:53:49,146 --> 00:53:50,444

现在,第二阶段

杰克，你想登上SAS戴立克的飞船吗?

849
00:53:55,334 --> 00:53:56,796
-我能把它吹起来吗?- 是的,请
- Can I blow it up? - Yes, please.

850
00:53:56,881 --> 00:53:58,413
我的计划
My kind of plan.

851
00:53:58,498 --> 00:54:00,454
-我有戴立克的问题- 真的吗?
- I have Dalek issues. - No kidding?

852
00:54:00,539 --> 00:54:02,077
你永远不会忘记你的第一次死亡
You never forget your first death.

853
00:54:02,162 --> 00:54:03,958
我和格雷厄姆跟你一起去
Me and Graham are coming with you.

854
00:54:04,128 --> 00:54:06,531
我们是- - - ?-戴立克的飞船，只有一个人

855
00:54:06,616 --> 00:54:08,866
如果我们不帮忙，人类就会灭亡
If we don't help, the human race is going down.

856

是的，是的，他说得对我们和你一起去
Yeah, yeah, he's right. We're coming with you.

857
00:54:12,177 --> 00:54:13,967
哇，哇，你不介意吧?
Whoa, whoa, are you OK with this?

858
00:54:17,847 --> 00:54:20,092
就算我想，也阻止不了他们
I couldn't stop them even if I wanted to.

859
00:54:20,312 --> 00:54:22,014
在我们确定之前不能爆炸
No detonation until we're sure

860
00:54:22,099 --> 00:54:25,108
特种空勤团戴立克摧毁了罗伯逊所有的创造物
that the SAS Daleks have destroyed all of Robertson's creations.

861
00:54:25,193 --> 00:54:28,702
显然在你们离开戴立克的飞船之前
And before you're all clear of the Dalek ship, obviously.

862
00:54:28,943 --> 00:54:32,421
很明显我们走了这么远不是为了被消灭
Obviously. We didn't come this far just to get exterminated.

863
00:54:34,226 --> 00:54:36,499
好吧,男孩抓住
OK, boys. Hold tight.

864

指挥中心在那边
OK, command centre is down that way.

867
00:54:48,244 --> 00:54:50,796
不要走那条路大多数戴立克都会在那里
Do not go that way. That's where most of the Daleks will be.

868
00:54:50,894 --> 00:54:52,383
-你知道该怎么做吗?-是的
- Are you clear on what to do? - Yeah.

869

把这些东西摊开，别送命
Spread these things out and don't get killed.

870
00:54:54,622 --> 00:54:57,237
- 就是这样祝你好运- 嗯-哦…
- That's it. Good luck. - Uh. - Oh...

871

就是这样,不是吗?瑞安，看，这是我们的专长
That's it, eh? Ryan, see, this is our area of expertise.

872
00:55:06,888 --> 00:55:09,089
先是网络男，现在是戴立克

873
00:55:09,174 --> 00:55:11,780
没有一艘外星飞船能躲过我们两个坏小子
no alien ship is safe from us two bad boys.

874
00:55:15,694 --> 00:55:17,085
什么?
What?

875
00:55:17,188 --> 00:55:19,350
别这么奇怪了，格雷厄姆
Stop talking weird, Graham.

876
00:55:22,914 --> 00:55:24,233
对不起
Sorry.

877
00:55:27,854 --> 00:55:30,570
警报!船舶内部传感器报告
Alert! Internal ship sensors report

878
00:55:30,662 --> 00:55:32,749
船上有非戴立克生命!

879
00:55:32,903 --> 00:55:38,163
寻找，定位并消灭所有非戴立克生物!

880
00:55:51,296 --> 00:55:54,330
好的!这里谁负责?
OK! Who's in charge here?

881
00:55:54,474 --> 00:55:56,876
我只想和老板说话
I only want to talk to the boss.

882
00:55:57,172 --> 00:55:58,692
说!
Speak!

883
00:56:00,119 --> 00:56:04,788
首先，你得知道我是站在你这边的
Well, first of all, you need to know that I'm on your side.

884
00:56:04,873 --> 00:56:08,309
为了证明这一点，我可以告诉你
Now, to prove that, I can tell you this -

885
00:56:08,754 --> 00:56:11,209
你们正走向一个陷阱
you're all headed into a trap.

886
00:56:12,781 --> 00:56:16,617
叫你来的那个人，她叫你博士
The person who summoned you, she's called the Doctor.

887
00:56:16,702 --> 00:56:20,264
博士是戴立克种族的敌人!
The Doctor is an enemy of the Dalek race!

888
00:56:20,453 --> 00:56:23,280
我知道所以，事情是这样的
I know. So, here's the deal.

889
00:56:23,574 --> 00:56:26,671
你放我一命，我帮你找到她
You let me live, I help you find her.

890
00:56:26,756 --> 00:56:28,792

紧急空间转移!消灭!
Incoming emergency spatial shift! Exterminate!

892
00:56:32,888 --> 00:56:36,561
不消灭我是戴立克停止!

我们清除了所有的杂质!

00:56:57,099 --> 00:57:00,175
我试图通知舰队

900
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:04,976
我为戴立克的事业鞠躬尽瘁

啊!杰克，炸药都放好了好了
Argh! Jack, explosives all laid. Good to go.

907
00:57:29,552 --> 00:57:31,228
- 的-什么意思?
- Sort of. - What do you mean?

908
00:57:31,493 --> 00:57:33,577
博士，我有好消息和坏消息
Doctor, I've got some good news and some bad news.

909
00:57:33,662 --> 00:57:35,138
好消息是
The good news is

910
00:57:35,237 --> 00:57:37,809
罗伯逊最后一个戴立克已经被摧毁了
the last of Robertson's Daleks has been destroyed.

911
00:57:37,894 --> 00:57:39,547
我们能不能停一下，假装没有坏消息?
Can we stop there and pretend there's no bad news?

912
00:57:39,631 --> 00:57:42,382
坏消息是罗伯逊正在和戴立克谈判
The bad news is Robertson is negotiating with the Daleks

913
00:57:42,467 --> 00:57:43,423
却出卖了你
and has sold you out.

914
00:57:43,508 --> 00:57:46,694
戴立克知道是你把他们带到这里的，把他们当做陷阱
The Daleks know it was you who brought them here, as a trap.

915
00:57:47,512 --> 00:57:49,447
我就知道我不喜欢这个坏消息
I knew I wouldn't like the bad news.

916
00:57:50,537 --> 00:57:51,693
我们该怎么办?
What do we do?

917
00:57:51,778 --> 00:57:53,993
好吧，我只是看一遍选项…
Right, just running through the options...

918
00:57:54,566 --> 00:57:55,842
. .这没花多长时间
..which hasn't taken long.

919
00:57:55,927 --> 00:57:57,139
即使我们把船炸了，
Even if we blow up the ship,

920
00:57:57,224 --> 00:57:59,859
SAS戴立克还在地球上空肆虐，
there's still SAS Daleks marauding through Earth's skies,

921
00:57:59,944 --> 00:58:01,757
现在他们知道我在这里!
and now they know I'm here!

922
00:58:02,191 --> 00:58:03,947
所以我们得让你远离他们
So we have to keep you out their way.

923
00:58:04,454 --> 00:58:05,686
还是……
Or...

924
00:58:05,771 --> 00:58:06,807
还是别的什么?
Or what?

925
00:58:06,892 --> 00:58:09,897
嘘工作博士,告诉我
Shh. Working. Doctor, tell me.

926
00:58:10,077 --> 00:58:11,922
这件事上你得相信我，Yaz
You're going to have to trust me on this, Yaz.

927
00:58:12,007 --> 00:58:14,007
我什么时候让你失望过?
When have I ever let you down before?

928
00:58:20,014 --> 00:58:21,674
我不会再消失了
I won't disappear again.

929
00:58:21,953 --> 00:58:24,168
是的,你会的
Yeah, you will.

930
00:58:24,738 --> 00:58:26,335
总有一天，你会的
One day, you will.

931
00:58:31,921 --> 00:58:33,053
我们在哪里?
Where are we?

932
00:58:33,138 --> 00:58:35,254
好的，过来监视这个计时器
Right, come here and monitor this timer.

933
00:58:35,424 --> 00:58:38,221
杰克，我需要你准备好让所有人离开那艘飞船然后引爆
Jack, I need you to be ready to get everyone off that ship and detonate.

934
00:58:38,305 --> 00:58:39,720
Yaz会告诉你什么时候
Yaz will tell you when.

935
00:58:39,805 --> 00:58:41,353
那其他戴立克呢?
What about the other Daleks?

936
00:58:41,438 --> 00:58:43,220
我正在对付他们!
I'm dealing with them!

937
00:58:46,666 --> 00:58:47,704
嘿
Hey.

938
00:58:48,092 --> 00:58:52,009
-我有点迷路了警报,警报!
- I'm a bit lost. - Alert, alert!

939
00:58:52,094 --> 00:58:54,090
没有听起来不错你要去接电话吗?
Didn't sound good. Do you want to get that?

940
00:58:54,174 --> 00:58:55,455
留在这里
Remain here.

941
00:58:55,540 --> 00:58:59,209
所有戴立克单位，到中央控制中心报到
All Dalek units, report to central control.

942
00:58:59,294 --> 00:59:01,252
博士被发现了!

943
00:59:01,337 --> 00:59:04,087

给我们一个要救你的理由
Give us one good reason why we should save your life.

946
00:59:09,282 --> 00:59:10,438
钱吗?
Money?

947
00:59:10,523 --> 00:59:12,799
-我还是认为我们应该把他留在这里-是的
- I still say we should leave him here. - Yeah.

948
00:59:12,884 --> 00:59:14,280
消灭!
Exterminate!

949
00:59:14,365 --> 00:59:15,548
走吧!
Go!

950
00:59:15,633 --> 00:59:20,310
博士的塔迪斯已经找到了围绕着TARDIS !
The Doctor's TARDIS is located. Surround the TARDIS!

951
00:59:21,668 --> 00:59:23,607
嘿!戴立克!
Hey! Daleks!

952
00:59:23,793 --> 00:59:26,173
- 在这里!- 是博士!
- Over here! - It is the Doctor!

953
00:59:26,305 --> 00:59:28,923
博士是戴立克的敌人!
The Doctor is an enemy of the Daleks!

954
00:59:29,008 --> 00:59:31,642
是的,它是是的，我是

我叫你来，你来了，就像听话的小宠物
I called you here and you came, like obedient little pets.

956
00:59:35,641 --> 00:59:36,916
谢谢你解决了我的问题
Thanks for solving my problem.

957
00:59:37,001 --> 00:59:39,597
戴立克不是博士的宠物!
Daleks are not pets of the Doctor!

958
00:59:39,682 --> 00:59:41,719
是的,你是为什么?你打算怎么做?
Yes, you are. Why? What are you going to do about it?

959
00:59:41,803 --> 00:59:43,759
因为我就站在这里，在我的塔迪斯里
Cos I'm just standing here, in my TARDIS.

960
00:59:43,844 --> 00:59:47,099
攻击TARDIS !消灭博士!
Attack the TARDIS! Exterminate the Doctor!

961
00:59:50,335 --> 00:59:52,131
你确定这条路对吗?
You're sure this is the right way?

962
00:59:52,216 --> 00:59:54,461
-到处都是戴立克!-我们得赶紧离开这里
- There's Daleks everywhere! - We've got to get us out of here.

963
00:59:54,545 --> 00:59:55,701
你是入侵者!
You are intruders!

964
00:59:55,786 --> 00:59:57,563
这是一次可怕的营救!
This is a terrible rescue!

965
00:59:57,653 --> 01:00:00,478
入侵者的位置!生命形式确认!

966
01:00:00,563 --> 01:00:01,422
我们包围!
We're surrounded!

01:00:01,507 --> 01:00:03,914
-别动!-别动!

968
01:00:03,999 --> 01:00:06,086
嘿，准备好了吗?我引爆吗?
Hey, are we ready? Do I detonate?

969
01:00:06,171 --> 01:00:07,985
几乎抓住
Almost. Grab hold.

970
01:00:08,070 --> 01:00:10,094
现在,杰克!下船!
Now, Jack! Get off the ship!

971
01:00:10,179 --> 01:00:12,696
入侵者,确定!
Intruders, identify!

972
01:00:12,781 --> 01:00:16,571
我是杰克·哈克尼斯船长我是不朽的哈!
I'm Captain Jack Harkness. And I'm immortal. Ha!

973
01:00:16,844 --> 01:00:19,179
消灭!
Exterminate!

974
01:00:25,457 --> 01:00:28,016
戴立克工艺摧毁!
Dalek craft destroyed!

975
01:00:28,101 --> 01:00:30,218
博士在哪里?!
Where is the Doctor?!

976
01:00:30,303 --> 01:00:33,419
搜索TARDIS !消灭博士!
Search the TARDIS! Exterminate the Doctor!

977
01:00:33,574 --> 01:00:37,530
哦,伙伴!你上当了
Oh, mate! You fell for the old switcheroo.

978
01:00:37,614 --> 01:00:40,113
- 尴尬-那不是我的塔迪斯
- Awkward. - That's not my TARDIS.

979
01:00:40,198 --> 01:00:41,914
我有一个备用的，
I had a spare one lying around,

980
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:44,239
所以我用变色龙的电路让它看起来像我的，
so I used the chameleon circuit to make it look like mine,

981
01:00:44,323 --> 01:00:45,517
猜猜谁上当了?
and guess who fell for it?

982
01:00:45,602 --> 01:00:46,638
你们
You guys.

983
01:00:46,723 --> 01:00:48,339
我们会找到你的!
We shall find you!

984
01:00:48,424 --> 01:00:51,020
我们控制了塔迪斯!
We have control of a TARDIS!

985
01:00:51,494 --> 01:00:54,530
不你不对不起
No. You don't. Sorry.

986
01:00:54,614 --> 01:00:58,300
更多的坏消息我给它编了个程序，让它自己折叠
More bad news. I've programmed it to fold in on itself

987
01:00:58,385 --> 01:01:00,980
把自己送到虚空之心，
and send itself to the heart of the Void,

988
01:01:01,065 --> 01:01:05,421
这当然会使它分裂，并在这个过程中摧毁你
which will of course break it apart and destroy you in the process.

989
01:01:05,642 --> 01:01:06,998
谢谢你今天的帮助
Thanks for helping today.

990
01:01:07,224 --> 01:01:08,433
一会儿见不到你了
Won't be seeing you later.

991
01:01:08,518 --> 01:01:11,249
不你逃不掉的，博士!
No. You will not escape us, Doctor!

992
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:14,238
是的,我会的每一次
Yes, I will. Every time.

993
01:01:27,574 --> 01:01:29,652
哦，太可怕了我感觉不舒服
Oh, that was horrible. I feel sick.

994
01:01:29,814 --> 01:01:31,066
我这是怎么了?
What just happened to me?

995
01:01:31,151 --> 01:01:32,402
我们成功了吗?
Did we do it?

996
01:01:32,494 --> 01:01:34,250
我们做到了!
We did it!

997
01:01:34,441 --> 01:01:36,011
戴立克流亡
Daleks all exiled.

998
01:01:36,096 --> 01:01:38,527
现在，你要做很多解释
Now, you have got a lot of explaining to do.

999
01:01:41,227 --> 01:01:43,980
我故意充当诱饵
I was deliberately acting as a decoy.

1000
01:01:47,073 --> 01:01:49,472
他们称他为人类的救世主，
They're calling him the saviour of humanity,

1001
01:01:49,557 --> 01:01:52,792
那个为我们所有人勇敢抵抗侵略者的人
the man who stood up to the invaders on behalf of us all.

1002
01:01:52,877 --> 01:01:54,649
现在，谣言四起
Now, as rumours intensify

1003
01:01:54,734 --> 01:01:57,570
他可能会被授予荣誉爵士头衔，
that he may be in line for an honorary knighthood,

1004
01:01:57,654 --> 01:02:01,472
杰克·罗伯逊在他美国的家中与我进行了交谈
Jack Robertson spoke to me from his home in the United States.

1005
01:02:01,587 --> 01:02:04,558
艾米丽，我做了任何男人-
Emily, I did what any man -

1006
01:02:05,386 --> 01:02:07,644
人，人的人-
person, human person -

1007
01:02:08,116 --> 01:02:10,534
在那种情况下是可以的
would do in those circumstances.

1008
01:02:11,064 --> 01:02:14,691
甚至有传言说你会重新竞选总统
There's even talk of a revived presidential run for you.

1009
01:02:14,957 --> 01:02:18,222
我不能回答这个问题
Well, I can't really answer to that.

1010
01:02:19,969 --> 01:02:23,136
-你能相信吗?-是的，我可以
- Can you believe that? - Yeah, I can.

1011
01:02:25,463 --> 01:02:27,152
我们应该去见见博士
We should go and meet the Doc.

1012
01:02:37,090 --> 01:02:38,450
是的
Yeah.

1013
01:02:41,575 --> 01:02:43,089
抱歉，忘了时间了
Sorry, lost track of time.

1014
01:02:43,174 --> 01:02:44,934
对了，格温·库珀向你问好
Gwen Cooper sends her love, by the way.

1015
01:02:45,019 --> 01:02:48,181
说她拿了戴立克的摩托车和她儿子的拳击手套
Says she took out a Dalek with a moped and her son's boxing gloves.

1016
01:02:48,266 --> 01:02:49,262
一个!
Hoo-hoo!

1017
01:02:49,347 --> 01:02:52,097
不管怎样，我要留在地球上追上她
Anyway, I'm going to stick around on Earth and catch up with her.

1018
01:02:52,182 --> 01:02:53,138
我会打电话给你
I'll call ya.

1019
01:02:53,223 --> 01:02:56,339
代我向格温问好好吧,再见!
Send my love to Gwen. OK, bye!

1020
01:02:56,424 --> 01:02:57,683
对了,家人,
Right, fam,

1021
01:02:57,768 --> 01:03:00,995
我想我们可以试试蛋白糖霜星系
I thought we could try the Meringue Galaxy.

1022
01:03:01,087 --> 01:03:03,489
这不是地方，这是餐厅
It's not a place, it's a restaurant

1023
01:03:03,574 --> 01:03:05,970
每一道菜都是蛋白霜
where every course is meringue.

1024
01:03:06,054 --> 01:03:07,409
和家具
And the furniture.

1025
01:03:08,014 --> 01:03:10,888
加上服务员!爱它!
Plus the waiters! Love it!

1026
01:03:11,453 --> 01:03:14,468
- 都准备好了吗?- 准备好了- 是的
- All set? - Ready. - Yep.

1027
01:03:17,454 --> 01:03:18,763
不
Nah.

1028
01:03:22,571 --> 01:03:24,709
我想我还是留在这里吧
I think I'm going to stay here.

1029
01:03:30,374 --> 01:03:32,006
是的
Yeah.

1030
01:03:33,629 --> 01:03:35,256
我的朋友需要我
Me mates need me.

1031
01:03:36,696 --> 01:03:38,812
我知道这听起来很蠢，但是…
And I know this sounds stupid, but...

1032
01:03:39,098 --> 01:03:41,342
. .我觉得我的星球需要我
..I feel like my planet needs me.

1033
01:03:43,404 --> 01:03:45,349
你得为之奋斗，对吧?
You've got to fight for it, right?

1034
01:03:46,415 --> 01:03:47,731
看,博士,之前…
Look, Doctor, before...

1035
01:03:47,816 --> 01:03:50,456
. .在我遇到你之前，我不知道我这辈子想做什么
..before I met you, I didn't know what I wanted to do with me life.

1036
01:03:51,316 --> 01:03:52,518
和…
And...

1037
01:03:53,678 --> 01:03:55,260
而现在……现在，我知道了
And now... And now, I know.

1038
01:04:02,281 --> 01:04:03,737
十个月
Ten months.

1039
01:04:05,778 --> 01:04:07,260
我回来得太晚了
I made it back too late.

1040
01:04:08,745 --> 01:04:10,456
错过了和你在一起的时光
Missed my time with you.

1041
01:04:12,432 --> 01:04:14,159
那么，我们是要拥抱还是? ?
So, are we hugging, or...?

1042
01:04:26,940 --> 01:04:29,698
你们两个呢?你打算……吗?
What about you two? Are you going to...?

1043
01:04:29,783 --> 01:04:31,456
留下来吗?是的,当然
Stay? Yeah, definitely.

1044
01:04:32,376 --> 01:04:33,885
是的!

1045
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:37,549
我还没准备好让你走
I'm not ready to let you go yet.

1046
01:04:38,359 --> 01:04:40,034
很好，不是吗?
That's all right, isn't it?

1047
01:04:40,951 --> 01:04:42,573
你已经说过了，所以…
You've said it now, so...

1048
01:04:44,948 --> 01:04:47,401
当然可以她需要你
Of course it's all right. She needs you.

1049
01:04:48,929 --> 01:04:50,799
- Yaz万岁! - 嗨
- Yes for Yaz! - Hey.

1050
01:04:50,891 --> 01:04:52,792
我走得够快了，你也忘了
You're getting over me leaving quick enough.

1051

两颗心
Two hearts.

1052
01:04:55,923 --> 01:04:57,104
一个快乐…

1053
01:04:58,894 --> 01:05:00,049
