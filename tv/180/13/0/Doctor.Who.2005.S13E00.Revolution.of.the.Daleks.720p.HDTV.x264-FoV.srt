1
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,840
Exterminate!

2
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,120
The Doctor must be destroyed!

3
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,520
Earth is protected by me and my
mates, this year and every other.

4
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,000
Here we go!

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,600
Exterminate!

6
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,600
Now attach the parts.
Weapon failure.

7
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,200
The parts are on, Doctor!
Get clear!

8
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,560
Is everyone all right in there?

9
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,800
We had an accident.

10
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,520
People got hurt.

11
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,840
The issue's been dealt with.

12
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:21,160
There'll be someone waiting
at Depository 23.

13
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,280
Long time since we opened that one.

14
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,400
Whatever that is, is it safe?

15
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,120
Just get it there quick as you can.

16
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,360
Am I allowed to stop for a cuppa?

17
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,240
Oh, only cos it's you.

18
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,520
How's your mum, by the way?

19
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,920
Yeah, you know...
Must be hard.

20
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,520
Yeah. Best get on the road.

21
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,640
Hi. Hi.

22
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,440
Can I get a cup of tea in there,
please? Thank you.

23
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,480
There you go, love.
Cheers.

24
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,680
Have a good day.
Thanks very much. Have a good one.

25
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,640
When you said breakfast meeting,

26
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,440
I presumed it would be somewhere
that served breakfast.

27
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,560
Jo Patterson.
Leo Rugazzi.

28
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,640
CEO, Rugazzi Technologies.

29
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,520
I acquired Leo's company
18 months ago.

30
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,560
I see you buying a lot of companies
right now.

31
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,800
They're calling you
the American Mike Ashley.

32
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,440
There's a lot of value
in the market today.

33
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,520
Having your political ambitions
ruined

34
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,320
by that little toxic waste scandal

35
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,160
seems to have been a blessing
in disguise.

36
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,440
That's a very sensitive subject
for me.

37
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,000
I just wanted to say
that I am super-psyched

38
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,880
about having a proper
Technology Secretary at last.

39
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:54,280
I was super-psyched too, until they
told me that my budget was £2.70.

40
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,080
Well, if anybody can make it work,
it's you, Jo.

41
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,880
Show me why we're here.

42
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,480
Leo has something...

43
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,760
..revolutionary to show you.

44
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,480
Just a small role-play.

45
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,720
We all know the problems facing
the world today.

46
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,320
Trust in our leaders
is at an all-time low.

47
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,640
Civil unrest is growing.

48
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,680
Security budgets are falling.

49
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,880
Our police forces are
under pressure.

50
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,720
Goodness, I hope no-one's going
to get hurt.

51
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,840
The problem is obvious.
Here's the solution.

52
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,560
Built-in water cannon.

53
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,800
And CS gas.

54
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,640
We're not using actual CS gas.

55
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,920
I still think it
would have been fine.

56
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,280
SHOUTS: Sonic deterrent!

57
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,200
Entirely robotic with
an AI interface programme

58
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,600
for every eventuality,

59
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,160
thanks to extensive
real-world scenario testing.

60
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,920
Er, solar...solar powered
with A-grade energy rating.

61
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,520
You built this yourself?

62
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,960
Oh, pretty much. Um, once
Mr Robertson became involved,

63
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,120
he really helped us
turbo-boost the whole project.

64
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,880
Actually, talking about...

65
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,720
Er, she gets the picture, Leo.
That's fine.

66
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,160
This is a game-changer, Jo.

67
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,280
It's the security equivalent
of the iPhone.

68
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,600
Shall we talk in private?

69
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,560
I want them built
and beta tested in my constituency.

70
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,360
Yes, yes, as discussed.

71
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,960
When those car firms deserted you,
I bought up all the plants.

72
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:34,480
I own them now. So we repurpose -
new infrastructure, new jobs.

73
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,840
This is going to be a big win for
you, Jo.

74
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:42,640
A flagship policy from
our dynamic new Technology Secretary

75
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:47,240
and it looks like, er, your party's
going to need a new leader soon.

76
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,040
What does he know, young Leo?

77
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,960
Only that I got the parts from
some unknown source.

78
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,160
If it ever gets out that I tipped
you off

79
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,640
about advanced technology
being transported from GCHQ...

80
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,440
It won't.

81
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,520
We trust each other.

82
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,440
This is a good arrangement, Jo.

83
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,320
You're simply facilitating
an acquisition

84
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,960
and I'm cutting you in on the IP.

85
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,280
Nobody knows.

86
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,280
Everybody wins.

87
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,520
How long will it take?

88
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,600
Er, a year, give or take.

89
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,440
Ugh...

90
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,560
Morning, camera 37.

91
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,080
Morning, camera 38.

92
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,120
Morning, Angela.

93
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,800
All right, Bonnie and Clyde?

94
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,320
Tiny!

95
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,400
How many times?

96
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,880
You can't eat the cage.
Believe me, I've tried.

97
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,240
Bedtime story, Doctor?

98
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,840
Yes, please, Doctor.

99
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,360
One of the classics?

100
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,360
Ooh, yes, please.

101
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,840
Settle down, then.

102
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,720
"Mr and Mrs Dursley, of number four
Privet Drive, were proud to say

103
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,200
"that they were perfectly normal..."

104
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,360
What?

105
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,800
Who's there?

106
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,720
Stay strong.

107
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,400
People are waiting for you.

108
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,800
I keep thinking - she was barely in
here for a couple of minutes

109
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,160
and yet she coded the entry lock
to our DNA,

110
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,040
just like on her own TARDIS.

111
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:02,280
Maybe that's cos she wanted us to be
able to follow her, to find her,

112
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,760
cos she needed us.

113
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,160
I'm going to work it out.

114
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,840
I must be able to work it out.

115
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,080
Happy New Year, Yaz.

116
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,800
When was it New Year?

117
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,760
You been sleeping in here?

118
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,040
Maybe.

119
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,360
Yaz, you can't keep being here
all the time.

120
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,320
The Doc, you know, she went to do
something she knew might kill her.

121
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,520
We've just got to assume she
didn't make it. Why?

122
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,880
Why do we have to assume that?

123
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,440
Mate, we've been back ten months.

124
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,840
We have to get on with our lives.

125
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,320
That's what she told us.
That's what she wanted for us.

126
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,320
But what if she needs us?

127
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,680
How many times has she saved us?

128
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,880
Yaz, face up to it,
we don't know how to find her.

129
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,440
All right?

130
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,920
And there's something else.

131
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,080
Graham, show her. Mm-hm.

132
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,960
The Doc would really want us
to keep an eye on the planet, right?

133
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:01,160
Look, this is leaked online footage

134
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:04,360
of what they're calling
a prototype security drone.

135
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,320
Apparently, this was taken
over a year ago. Just watch.

136
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,640
That's a Dalek. Mm-hm.

137
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,040
But how's that possible?

138
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,320
No idea. Watch.

139
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,640
Jack Robertson.

140
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,560
Spider guy. Mm.

141
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,240
He's in league with a Dalek?

142
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,440
That's what we're going
to find out.

143
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,240
And that's what the Doc would do
if she was here, so...

144
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,880
..are you with us?

145
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,240
Well, it's an honour

146
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,920
to be summoned by
the Prime Minister in waiting...

147
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,440
..even if it is a bit, er, rural.

148
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,880
How many hours till we get
the results from the ballots?

149
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,840
The numbers are on my side.

150
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,280
That's why I wanted to talk.

151
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,560
You're not having doubts
about our agreement, are you?

152
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,440
Quite the opposite.

153
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,680
I want to expedite our project.

154
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,720
Six of the sweetest words in
the English language.

155
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,880
I want an immediate national
roll-out of security drones.

156
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,800
National?

157
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,000
But we've only just started
regional beta testing.

158
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,800
And I want it at no cost to
the British taxpayer.

159
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,120
Why, Jo, this is starting to sound
like a shakedown.

160
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,800
This country can be your shop window
for global sales.

161
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,160
Unless, of course, you'd like
the Treasury to take a look

162
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,680
at how much tax all your companies
pay over here?

163
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:36,280
Ah. Well played...

164
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,360
..Prime Minister.

165
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,000
Well played.

166
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,720
Leo? I'm outside.

167
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,400
Three minutes.

168
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,280
Yo. Remember us?

169
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,720
Take the car! Just leave my face.

170
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,000
What?

171
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:01,120
Oh, no! Not you guys!

172
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,920
Yeah, us, cos we know all about you
and that Dalek.

173
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,280
The what? The Dalek.

174
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,720
The most deadly creature in
the universe. We saw you with it.

175
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,760
What is this word that you keep
using?

176
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,240
Oh, don't play innocent! Dalek.

177
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,680
Whatever you're doing with it,
we're going to stop you.

178
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,400
MAN, IN DISTANCE: Hands in the air!
Step away from the car!

179
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,400
What, you didn't think
I'd increase my security

180
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,040
since the last time we met?

181
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,320
You're lucky
you're not all dead on the ground.

182
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,560
Get rid of 'em, boys.

183
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,280
Well, that didn't go exactly
to plan, did it?

184
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,040
I like that whole
"whatever you're doing,

185
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,400
"we're going to stop you" vibe.

186
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,600
Very Doctory.

187
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,760
Doesn't work when I do it.

188
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,120
We didn't get anywhere near
an explanation from him.

189
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,760
If we had the Doctor's psychic paper
or we knew how to work that TARDIS,

190
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,040
we could get into his office
and see what's going on.

191
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,120
Yeah, but we don't, so we're going

192
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,880
to have to try and figure out
another way.

193
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,320
Yeah. This is hard, innit?

194
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,560
Morning, camera 38.

195
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,320
Oh, I forgot you were here.

196
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,120
JACK: What about this face?

197
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,040
Remember this?

198
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,360
Jack?

199
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,520
Jack!

200
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,160
I knew you would look better
in these colours than me.

201
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,880
Hello, Doctor.

202
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,280
What are you doing here?

203
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,400
What do you think I'm doing here?
Breaking you out.

204
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:50,160
Temporal-freezing gateway
disinhibitor bubble. Catchy, right?

205
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,240
If it were me,
I'd have called it a breakout ball.

206
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,080
Freezes time temporarily,
breaks through walls.

207
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,680
Only problem is...

208
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,600
..it doesn't last long.

209
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,960
Hi!
Have you had work done?

210
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,400
You can talk!

211
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,880
Now shut up and run.

212
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,520
I heard a rumour you were in here,
so I committed a few crimes.

213
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,000
Well, maybe a lot of crimes.
Maybe more than I should have.

214
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,360
What sort of crimes?

215
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,480
Left turn. Oh!

216
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,640
You're going to take
the moral high ground with me

217
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,280
when I'm breaking you out of prison?

218
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,240
Be grateful! Front door!

219
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,080
How long has this thing got left?
11 seconds till expiry!

220
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,000
Go!

221
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,000
Phew!

222
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,560
Took 19 years to get to the cell
next to you.

223
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,360
Hope you had enough to occupy your
mind. Too much.

224
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,680
Here we go. One secretly stashed
vortex manipulator.

225
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:49,440
Wondered how long that would take.
We need to go now.

226
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,560
How did you manage
to smuggle that in here?

227
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,320
You really want me to answer that?

228
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,880
Oh, I've missed you...very much.

229
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,400
Let's go.

230
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,080
LEO: Operation, logistics and
production have all been called in.

231
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,440
Everyone has been told
maximum capacity, maximum speed,

232
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,160
and our beta partners are working
through the night,

233
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,560
training staff,
under our supervisors -

234
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,720
all under NDAs, of...of course.

235
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,920
We think we might have enough
in place to...

236
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,600
..well, to make the deadline.

237
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,280
Great.

238
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,720
Great job, Leo.
This is going to be good for us.

239
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,160
I-I can't help but feel a little...

240
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,120
..well, you know, a little worried
about the speed of this.

241
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,920
Everybody's worried, Leo.

242
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,000
We live in uncertain times.
Do you want to win?

243
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,720
Embrace the uncertainty.

244
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,840
Live in the worry.

245
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,280
O-OK. Um, so...

246
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,920
So...there's-there's just something
I-I needed to share

247
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,400
on this project.

248
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,880
When I first started working
on that casing,

249
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,360
I broke it down
into the tiniest components.

250
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:05,120
I made it my mission to, well,
to understand everything about it.

251
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,640
Yes, and you did a great job.

252
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,000
These machines are going
to change the world.

253
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,800
I'm not talking about the machines.

254
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,080
I'm talking about what was inside
the original artefact.

255
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,240
There's nothing inside, Leo.
It was a burnt-out shell.

256
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,120
Well, that's what
I'm trying to tell you.

257
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,160
This granular investigation
I've been doing, I...

258
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,080
..well, I found something more -

259
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,000
organic remnants inside the machine,

260
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,640
tiny cellular traces
scattered across the casing.

261
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,560
Where are you going with this, Leo?

262
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,840
Well...

263
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,800
Look, I'll ju... I'll just show you.

264
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,960
Look.

265
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,640
Just here, see?

266
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,040
I-I took the cellular traces
and I...

267
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,640
..and I cloned them.

268
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,400
Grew them.

269
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,360
I grew a creature.

270
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,280
Oh, my God!

271
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,960
It's beautiful, isn't it? No!

272
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,760
Are you insane?!

273
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,320
That's the most disgusting thing
I've ever seen in my life.

274
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,880
What were you thinking?

275
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,960
What? It's intelligent.

276
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,800
I hooked it into
the intra-neural network

277
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,680
and...and there were flickers of
activity.

278
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,440
It understood
our systems immediately.

279
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,880
You did what?!

280
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,760
All right. Not another word.

281
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,880
You've overreached, Leo.

282
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,920
I want this incinerated immediately.
What?!

283
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,320
No argument!

284
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,520
Ow!

285
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,880
I don't want to see a trace of this.

286
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,360
This never happened,
you never showed it to me,

287
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,760
this thing never existed.
Do you understand?

288
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,760
OK, OK.

289
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,640
You know what your problem is, Leo?

290
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,480
You're too clever.

291
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,240
This is why people don't
like experts.

292
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,680
I'm sorry.

293
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,920
Hi, love.

294
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,360
It... It's me.

295
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,240
I-I have to go on
an urgent business trip tonight.

296
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,240
Give the kids a kiss from me.

297
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,680
Er...

298
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,400
..I'll call you when I can.

299
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,840
Love you.

300
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,520
Bye.

301
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,880
DALEK: Love you.

302
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,320
Bye.

303
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,200
Stand.

304
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,040
DALEK: Good puppet.

305
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,520
We're out.

306
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,680
I'm back.

307
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,240
My own TARDIS.

308
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,880
Captain Jack Harkness,
gold star for rescuing.

309
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,120
Told your friends if you ever need
help, I'd be there.

310
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:09,240
Wow.

311
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,680
Nice upgrade in here.

312
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,840
Which way's my room?

313
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,360
You don't have a room.
You've never had a room.

314
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,760
I had a suite
with its own cocktail lounge.

315
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:24,120
They gave you my message,
about the lone Cyberman?

316
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,640
You didn't give it the Cyberium?

317
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,920
It's a long story. What?
I fixed it. Eventually.

318
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,040
Just about. Sort of.

319
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,160
Why were you in prison
in the first place?

320
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,320
Evading the Judoon. Twice at once.

321
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:38,960
Then once I was in, they took 7,000
other offences into consideration.

322
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,800
They stopped at seven?

323
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,480
I was in prison for being me...

324
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,440
..right at the point
when I wasn't sure what that meant.

325
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,280
Ah, it's been a tough few decades.

326
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,160
You're OK now, yeah?

327
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,280
Oh, I guess we'll find out.

328
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,360
Wakey-wakey.

329
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,120
Hey!

330
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,440
Nice nap?

331
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,160
Thanks for waiting.

332
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,360
I had a lot to think about in there.

333
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,800
And three very special people
I've missed.

334
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,200
One of them was me, right?
You never change.

335
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,760
Wish I could say the same.

336
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,480
Right.

337
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,960
Find me my fam.

338
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,880
This is what I've got so far.

339
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:27,960
Remnants of the Dalek we fought at
GCHQ were cleared but then stolen.

340
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,200
The driver is missing,
presumed dead.

341
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,680
Now Robertson's got his hands on it.

342
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,880
Well, he can't have,

343
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,800
because you sent that creature thing
that was inside it

344
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,520
into a supernova, so...

345
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,840
Maybe there's more of them here
on Earth.

346
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,320
And one's got Robertson
under their control.

347
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,800
Ryan, shh!

348
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,000
Please.

349
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,160
Please be her.

350
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,720
Hi! I was in space jail.

351
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,080
You what?

352
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,600
Guess who got her out?

353
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,240
You all met Jack, right?

354
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,680
Hey, silver fox!

355
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,040
Hello.

356
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,960
We were worried about you!

357
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,000
What? How long's it been?

358
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,280
A week?

359
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,280
Two weeks?

360
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,800
Ten months.

361
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,400
Er, whoops!

362
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,680
No, it can't be. I set identical
temporal coordinates

363
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,080
to when I sent you back.

364
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,000
Yeah, but your time machine ain't
the best

365
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,400
at running to time, is it, Doc?

366
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,000
I'm sorry.

367
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,960
Yeah, well, it's done now, so...

368
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,320
Yeah.

369
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,440
So...

370
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,280
..what's new on planet Earth?

371
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,440
ALL: Dalek.

372
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,520
DALEK: Forward.

373
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,080
Further. Further.

374
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,640
LEO: What is this place?

375
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,080
What have you done?

376
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:10,280
This is my project.

377
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:17,480
This is what I have built.

378
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:20,520
So, it looks like a Dalek,
but it can't be a Dalek...

379
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,040
..unless it is a Dalek!

380
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,480
Trust us. We've seen the footage.

381
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,960
If you scan for Dalek DNA trace
across the planet...

382
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,240
Oh, she's good.
Yeah, we all are.

383
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,600
So, you've had dealings
with Daleks as well, then?

384
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,320
Yeah, they killed me once.
Long time ago, no big deal.

385
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,320
You look pretty healthy for
a corpse. I know, right?

386
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,600
I can be killed but I come back to
life pretty quick.

387
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,320
Partially her fault, partially a
friend of hers on Earth called Rose.

388
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,800
But she's trapped
in a parallel universe now.

389
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,520
She's what?

390
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,440
Dalek DNA trace - Japan.

391
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,200
Osaka. Well, sort of.
Not an exact match.

392
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,880
Oh, it's corrupted.

393
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,400
I can't quite make sense of it.

394
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,840
I can check it out.
Anyone want to come?

395
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,480
I will!

396
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,040
I want a word with Robertson direct.
GRAHAM: Yeah, me too.

397
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,640
Looks like he's recently opened
a facility in Osaka.

398
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:10,000
We could check it out,
drop you on the way.

399
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,480
ROBERTSON: Everyone working at
maximum capacity.

400
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,240
VWORP-VWORP!

401
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,720
Er... Let me call you back.

402
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:33,840
If you're dealing with Daleks,
you are way out of your depth.

403
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,120
What is that thing?

404
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,040
I want to know
what you're doing right now,

405
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:40,200
and don't try calling security,
cos I just blocked your phone lines.

406
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,200
What is the matter with you people?
Hmm?

407
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,160
Do you want to know what I'm doing?
I'll show you myself.

408
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,920
Welcome to the production line.

409
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,560
You're making Daleks.

410
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:19,320
We're 3D-printing security drones.

411
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:23,200
What about what's inside?
There's nothing inside.

412
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,200
It's run by artificial intelligence.

413
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,120
What? Watch.

414
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,320
See?

415
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,360
They're machines.

416
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,520
There's the remote signal unit.

417
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,640
They're empty. Mm-hm.

418
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,760
You're messing with things
you don't understand.

419
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,640
The creature these are modelled on

420
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,720
is the most evil killing machine
in the universe.

421
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:55,080
You're getting much too excited
about a bunch of 3D-printed shapes.

422
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,160
So what are you doing
at your facility in Osaka?

423
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,000
We don't have a facility in Osaka.

424
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,960
Yeah, you do.
No, we don't!

425
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,320
I would know.

426
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,600
YAZ: It says this
is an agricultural park.

427
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,120
Guess this is the future.

428
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,520
Hmm.
Vertical farms. All inside.

429
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,440
In my time, there are whole
agri-planets that look like this,

430
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,880
shipping food all over galaxies.

431
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,440
Your time? 51st century.

432
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,720
Get lost!

433
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,800
Seriously. Boeshane Peninsula.

434
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,720
Maybe one day I'll take you there.

435
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,320
Are they all like you there?
No.

436
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,760
I'm pretty special.

437
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,400
Had a rough time, then?

438
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,800
Without the Doctor?

439
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,160
I don't know what you mean.

440
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,800
I saw the way you shoved her.

441
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,080
You thought she wasn't coming back,
right?

442
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,600
You're guessing a lot from a shove.

443
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,160
I have my own experience with
the Doctor.

444
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,320
I just missed her.

445
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,360
I never stopped to think...
Hey.

446
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:10,200
When I was with the Doctor, I saw
more than I could have ever dreamed.

447
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,160
And then...

448
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,440
..we lost each other.

449
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,200
I didn't know what happened to him.

450
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,760
If he was alive or...

451
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,760
..if I was ever going
to see him again.

452
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,040
Hard way to live.

453
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,520
Being with the Doctor, you don't get
to choose when it stops...

454
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,360
..whether you leave her or...

455
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,520
..she leaves you.

456
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,880
It felt cruel...

457
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,920
..to be shown something
I couldn't have any more.

458
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:55,160
Felt like, um,
I'd rather not have known.

459
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:58,080
I'd rather not have met her,
cos having met her and then...

460
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,080
..being without her, that's worse.

461
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,120
How do you deal with that?

462
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:07,480
How many people in the universe
get to meet the Doctor,

463
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,160
let alone travel with her?

464
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,520
We're the lucky ones, Yaz.

465
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,360
Enjoy the journey
while you're on it.

466
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,240
Cos the joy...

467
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,960
..is worth the pain.

468
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,160
Locked door.

469
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,040
Thanks.

470
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,400
"Thanks"?

471
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,600
That's it?

472
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,680
Are you feeling insecure?

473
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,720
Cos you seem to need
a lot of praise.

474
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,040
Do I?

475
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,640
Through here.

476
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,640
Those things.

477
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,040
They were what was inside
the Dalek we met.

478
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,640
Inside every Dalek.

479
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,280
This is a clone farm.

480
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,480
They're not growing food here,
they're...

481
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,680
..they're growing Daleks.

482
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,880
As your new Prime Minister,
I can see great opportunities ahead

483
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,200
for this country.

484
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,480
We here in Britain, we've never been
afraid of the future,

485
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:58,040
but I do understand that what we all
crave right now is security.

486
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,800
Security in our politics,

487
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,920
security in our jobs,

488
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,680
security for our families.

489
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:13,560
I pledge to bring stability
and security

490
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,400
to every aspect
of our national life.

491
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:23,960
Together, we can make this
the age of security.

492
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,440
ROBERTSON: What's happening here?

493
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,800
What are we actually doing?

494
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,600
Going to Osaka - fast!

495
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,760
VWORP-VWORP!
What about...?

496
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,160
What about this blue box?

497
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:36,000
What is it?
It's a... It's a doorway?

498
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,720
It can't be.

499
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,160
That was my hallway.

500
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,960
I don't understand.

501
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,200
Should we explain it to him?

502
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,120
No, it's more fun watching him
struggle.

503
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,680
As hard as it is for you to
understand, this isn't about you.

504
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,880
This is about Daleks.

505
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,600
Please stop using that word.
It has no meaning.

506
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,720
Yes, it does.

507
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:57,080
To billions of people,
Dalek means hate.

508
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:00,200
Daleks are creatures
of hate and aggression.

509
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:03,360
Daleks are insidious,
relentless and clever,

510
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:06,440
and, like hate, they will spread
if they're not stopped.

511
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,840
Never underestimate a Dalek.

512
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:12,640
Which is why I am unveiling today

513
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:17,880
a very exciting, new solution
to an age-old problem.

514
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:24,080
We will harness the technological
revolution to enhance your safety.

515
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:29,840
We will alleviate pressure on police
and security staff

516
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:33,040
and all without draining
the public purse.

517
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:49,360
JACK: Oi! Can you hurry up
and help me with this?

518
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,360
I need to take a sample of
the liquid.

519
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,280
I want to know
what it's being fed on.

520
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,280
Might give us a clue on
how to stop 'em.

521
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,320
Huh. We're going to blow 'em up,
kid.

522
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,240
That's how we stop 'em.

523
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,040
Jack!

524
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,680
Get it off me!

525
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,600
Stand still! Yaz, don't move!

526
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,200
Nice shot.

527
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,920
As of now, you will see
new defence drones at work

528
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,800
on Britain's streets...

529
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:09,520
..in our institutions,
at our borders...

530
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,400
..and national monuments.

531
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,760
These technological innovations
are set

532
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:20,320
to make Britain more secure.

533
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,000
You do love a beanie.

534
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,040
Me too.

535
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,440
One of the first things I noticed
about you that night we met.

536
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,160
I thought, "Not everyone can carry
off a yellow beanie.

537
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,800
"There's a lad to rely on."

538
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,280
Four minutes to Osaka.

539
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,880
Yeah. OK.

540
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,920
I'm sorry...

541
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,680
..about the ten months.

542
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:16,600
More sorry
than I can ever really say.

543
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,320
This thing, innit? You never
really quite got the hang of it.

544
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,320
I missed you all...

545
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,920
..so much.

546
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,600
Yeah?

547
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,640
We missed you too.

548
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,960
But you've been good?

549
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:44,480
Yeah, maybe it's what I needed.
Oh, yeah. Huh.

550
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,360
Maybe it was.

551
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,960
Hmm. I saw me dad.

552
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,440
Oh, good. Well, was it good?

553
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,760
He's all right?

554
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,720
Yeah, he's back at the oil rigs
again.

555
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,240
Due back in a couple of weeks.

556
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:00,280
But, yeah, we're good.
We're getting there.

557
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:03,360
Time to reconnect with him,
time to see me mates,

558
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,480
see what's happening
on the old planet.

559
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,880
Lots of work to be done
here on Earth.

560
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,640
Yeah. Always.

561
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,120
Well, it sounds like
you enjoyed being back.

562
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,800
It's home.

563
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,440
Yeah.

564
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,320
What's happening with your home?

565
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,720
You know, what happened to you
on Gallifrey?

566
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,520
All life there destroyed.

567
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,160
Thanks to the death particle
and Ko Sharmus.

568
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,080
And the Master?
What did he want with you?

569
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,720
It doesn't even matter now.
No, no, no.

570
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,680
Don't give me that. Right?
I see what you're doing.

571
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,520
You're trying to avoid the subject.

572
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,360
We've known each other
long enough now.

573
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,080
I know when something's changed.

574
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,120
Me too.

575
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,280
I'm not who I thought I was, Ryan.

576
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:12,640
What I always knew
to be the story of my life...

577
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,080
..isn't true.

578
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,480
I wasn't born on Gallifrey.

579
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,560
Where I'm from,
all the lives I've lived,

580
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:25,400
some of that has been hidden from
me, and I don't even know how much.

581
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,960
Seriously?

582
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,560
And how do you feel about that?

583
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,320
Mostly...

584
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,880
..angry.

585
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,800
While I was locked away,
all I kept thinking was...

586
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:46,960
"..If I'm not who I thought I was,
then who am I?"

587
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,560
You're the Doctor.

588
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,600
Same as before, same as always.

589
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,560
Right.

590
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,720
Same Doctor, same Ryan.

591
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,160
Nothing's changed.

592
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,920
No. No.

593
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,400
I didn't say that, did I?

594
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:11,440
Things change all the time,
and they should, cos they have to.

595
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,040
Same with people.

596
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:18,560
Sometimes we get a bit scared,
cos new can be a bit scary, right?

597
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,720
New can be very scary.

598
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:26,800
So, when we're done
with this Dalek problem,

599
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,320
you find out about your own life.

600
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,720
Confront the new, or the old.

601
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:37,080
And then everything will
be all right.

602
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:41,000
Will it? No doubt.

603
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,000
What?

604
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,520
Thank you, Ryan...

605
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,960
..for being my friend.

606
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,640
Thank you for being mine.

607
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,920
Always.

608
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,080
Osaka.

609
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:07,440
VWORP-VWORP!

610
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:13,440
Oh-ho-ho! I've missed that sound.

611
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,200
Whoa!

612
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,320
Wait, what just happened?

613
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,360
Still not telling him? No.

614
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,920
Where am I?

615
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,160
YAZ: Did you really
have to bring him? Yaz!

616
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,800
Graham.

617
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,320
Oh, what are those things?

618
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,600
The creatures
that live inside Daleks.

619
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,400
But who built all this?!

620
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,000
DALEK: I have.

621
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,560
ROBERTSON: Leo?
Don't get too close!

622
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,280
I warned you about that thing.

623
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,040
What have you done, Leo?

624
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:52,800
Cloned the smallest trace
of organic material,

625
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,000
not understanding that
Dalek consciousness

626
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,080
can live within the tiniest fragment
of their DNA.

627
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,480
You weren't to know.

628
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,840
You're safe. We're here for you.

629
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,640
We're going to get you
out of here alive.

630
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,960
DALEK: You give
this body false hope.

631
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:08,680
All right, then, Dalek,
or whatever you are,

632
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,840
tell me how you've built
all this.

633
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:14,360
DALEK: I connected myself into
the neural network.

634
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:19,280
I inserted myself into the
organisation, into every network.

635
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,880
I located this place, created it.

636
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,960
Every piece of equipment,
every idea behind it...

637
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,560
..I did that.

638
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,640
Wait a minute.
First of all, that's not possible.

639
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,240
Where did you get the purchase order
numbers in the first place?

640
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:37,520
Really, that's what's bugging you
most right now?

641
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:41,720
DALEK: I used your systems to buy
this building, to order equipment,

642
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:46,120
to pay humans to construct
and to continue the clone work.

643
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:51,800
I used your systems to build
an army all in my image.

644
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:55,920
But where are the workers? Where are
the people who did all the cloning?

645
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,600
DALEK: Once the experiments
were working, they became...

646
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,400
..unnecessary.

647
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,680
We found them another use.

648
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:13,320
What, you're feeding cloned
Dalek creatures liquidised humans?

649
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,880
DALEK: Correct.

650
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:17,680
ROBERTSON: This is a PR disaster.

651
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:20,280
But there's something else
that's bugging me.

652
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:22,440
What is it?
Is it the light?

653
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:25,240
The light's been changing really
slowly ever since we've been here.

654
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:27,560
Yes, it is. Thanks, Yaz.
I missed you, Yaz.

655
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:28,960
Right, why is that important?

656
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:32,120
Oh, there's too much going on.
Where was I?

657
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:34,400
Yes. How are you going to get
off this planet?

658
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,040
DALEK: We will not.

659
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,160
I'm sorry?

660
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:40,240
The planet is ours.
It will be converted.

661
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,600
Converted into what?

662
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,560
We shall use this planet as a base

663
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:47,160
from which to conquer
this sector of the universe.

664
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,640
There's a long way between squatting
in a Japanese lab

665
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:50,960
and subjugating humanity.

666
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,480
I mean, you don't even have bodies.

667
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,920
What are you going to do?
Order people from your tanks?

668
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:58,080
Even if you made it to those shells
down there, which you can't.

669
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,360
You can't.

670
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,800
I mean, you definitely can't. The...

671
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:07,920
Those shells aren't even weaponised.
They're not proper Daleks.

672
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,960
He built them.
Doctor...

673
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:13,000
..what's the matter?

674
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,160
The light.

675
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:17,920
The shells were built
in his factories.

676
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,880
Do you think I've not augmented
those designs also?

677
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,480
Where's the light?
We have to turn off the light!

678
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:24,600
Why, Doctor?

679
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:25,840
Ultraviolet light.

680
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:28,360
The Recon Dalek used
it to come back together.

681
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:29,840
Activate!

682
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:34,360
My project shall be complete.

683
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:44,400
The New Dalek Army
shall have but one purpose.

684
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,680
Exterminate!

685
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:02,280
Exterminate!

686
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:27,920
It appears that there
are some teething issues with

687
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,400
the...with the drones,

688
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:32,680
so I appeal to everybody
to keep calm.

689
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:34,800
The drones are completely under
our control,

690
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,640
so we're working to
shut them down...

691
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,720
DALEK: Territorial leader
identified.

692
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:42,480
Daleks will not be shut down.
Daleks are supreme.

693
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,400
This must be some sort of a joke.

694
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,680
DALEK: Daleks do not joke.

695
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:49,880
And I do not surrender.
Exterminate!

696
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:53,680
This territory is the property
of the Daleks.

697
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:56,320
Daleks are in control.

698
00:46:56,320 --> 00:47:00,080
All humanity will be exterminated.

699
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:02,600
How many Daleks did you build?
Look, I don't know.

700
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:03,920
How many?! Thousands!

701
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,160
LEO: Stop.

702
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:09,120
You don't have to kill him.

703
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:10,440
DALEK: Correct.

704
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:13,680
I do not have to, and yet...

705
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:24,480
I'm sorry.

706
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,520
Oh, Leo!

707
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,600
No weapons. No time to think.

708
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:39,640
All that time in
a cell wondering who I am.

709
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:42,880
I'm the Doctor.

710
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,680
I'm the one who stops the Daleks.

711
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:48,960
All of you, to the TARDIS now!

712
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,760
Only one thing I can think of.
Nuclear option.

713
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:58,120
Nuclear option that might backfire.

714
00:47:58,120 --> 00:47:59,800
If it's what
I think you're thinking,

715
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,640
you'd better stop thinking
it right now.

716
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:03,480
Way too big a risk.

717
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:05,480
How big a risk?
Planet-threatening.

718
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:07,520
Got any better ideas?
Cos now is your moment.

719
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:08,920
I'm all ears.

720
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:12,080
Exactly!

721
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:14,000
So, what is it you're going to do?

722
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,360
They're built from
the original Reconnaissance Dalek.

723
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,280
I'm going to give them
what they wanted in the first place.

724
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:27,120
What's she doing?
Something you never want to do.

725
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:43,760
GRAHAM: Doc, what have you done?

726
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:46,320
Sent a message through the timelines
into the vortex,

727
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:49,440
cos I know they're in there,
like sharks in water.

728
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:53,400
Always scoping, always ready.

729
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:07,600
Incoming reconnaissance
signal detected.

730
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:08,840
Strategise!

731
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:11,840
Programme destination for Earth.

732
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:14,400
Resistance must be expected!

733
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,880
Ready attack formation protocols!

734
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:21,960
Who's in there?

735
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:24,360
The ship you never want to see
arriving on your planet.

736
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:26,840
What's on it?
Death Squad Daleks.

737
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:28,760
Think of them like the SAS
of Daleks.

738
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:31,680
Only way more brutal.
They're our best hope right now.

739
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,280
But they're going
to kill more humans.

740
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,240
They don't care about humans.

741
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:37,480
They're the enforcers
of the Dalek race.

742
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:39,840
To combat Daleks,
you've brought more Daleks?

743
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:42,280
Yes, but they don't know
that I'm behind the transmission,

744
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:44,880
and it's quite important
that they don't realise I'm here.

745
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,960
We've got previous.
We're not best mates.

746
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,080
All right, look,
so if your plan works

747
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:51,320
and this set of Daleks kills
his lot...

748
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:52,960
It's not my lot. Thank you.

749
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,760
..how do we get rid of
the new ones?

750
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:57,040
That's phase two of the plan.
It'll be down to us.

751
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,560
DALEK: Feeble humans, do not run!

752
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:02,320
Your bodies are too slow for Daleks!

753
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:05,440
Daleks are in control
of this territory!

754
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:09,120
Humans shall be exterminated!

755
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:14,920
The New Dalek Army is in control!

756
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:17,040
Daleks are reborn!

757
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:21,640
Nothing shall stop the supremacy
of the New Dalek Army!

758
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:33,120
Analysis!

759
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:36,760
Scan determines rogue creatures
below!

760
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:39,720
Mutated Dalek DNA detected!

761
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:44,360
Prepare for maximum extermination!

762
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:50,760
Primary rogue impurities located!

763
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:55,480
Isolate and engage
primary rogue Dalek impurities!

764
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:59,360
Seek and destroy
all other Dalek impurities!

765
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:03,680
Engaging primary rogue Dalek
impurities!

766
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,760
Halt. Stay where you are!

767
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:08,360
Daleks are now in control!
In control!

768
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:10,600
In control!

769
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:13,120
Daleks are already in control.

770
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:14,800
Identify!

771
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,240
Dalek!

772
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:19,080
Incorrect. Scan detects anomalies.

773
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:23,080
Dalek DNA merged with human traces.

774
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:27,400
We have mutated to survive.

775
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:32,640
You are impure!
The Dalek race must have purity!

776
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,640
Exterminate!

777
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:37,240
Exterminate the impurities!

778
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:41,320
Exterminate the impurities!
Exterminate the impurities!

779
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:46,600
That's the thing about Daleks.

780
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:50,000
For a race born out of mutation,
they're pretty obsessed with purity.

781
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,120
All that product.

782
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:54,520
Maybe I can make
a claim on insurance.

783
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:56,240
Get back in the TARDIS.

784
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,440
I don't take my orders
from you, Doctor.

785
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:05,320
Those are powerful,
intelligent creatures.

786
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:08,720
I'm backing them.

787
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:11,320
Don't be stupid. They will kill you.

788
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,520
I don't think so.

789
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:16,080
See you later.

790
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:18,520
Robertson, get back here!

791
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:30,480
Exterminate!
Wait, wait.

792
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,480
I come in peace.

793
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,080
Who are you?

794
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:36,040
I speak for humanity.

795
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:38,600
You are the leader of this planet?

796
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:40,200
Yes.

797
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:42,160
And I'm your best ally here.

798
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:45,400
Daleks do not need allies.

799
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:47,200
I know how the Earth works.

800
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,360
I have information.

801
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:51,200
I can guide you.

802
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:56,000
Daleks have no need of guidance
from humans.

803
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,920
You are unimportant.

804
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:03,760
I can see how you might think that,
but, er, I'm no ordinary human.

805
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:07,600
We shall destroy Dalek impurities!

806
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:09,280
Of course.

807
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:11,000
But when you're done with that,

808
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,400
you're going to want the planet too,
right?

809
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:17,600
Don't you think that would go down
well with your fellow Daleks?

810
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:24,560
You would betray your own race?

811
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:27,800
You would betray humanity?

812
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:30,000
Sure.

813
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,920
And I have some other information.

814
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:33,520
The signal that brought you here...

815
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:35,640
Explain!

816
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:38,600
First, I want to meet who's
in charge here.

817
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:44,400
In other words,
take me to your leader.

818
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,680
Phase one of the plan is working -

819
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:48,960
Daleks destroying other Daleks

820
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,640
in order to save humanity.

821
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,320
Now, phase two.

822
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:55,000
Jack, how do you feel
about boarding an SAS Dalek ship?

823
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Can I blow it up? Yes, please.

824
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,320
My kind of plan.

825
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:00,360
I have Dalek issues. No kidding?

826
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:02,240
You never forget your first death.

827
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,120
Me and Graham are coming with you.

828
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:05,880
Are we?
Big Dalek ship, only one guy.

829
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:08,120
If we don't help,
the human race is going down.

830
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:12,240
Yeah, yeah, he's right.
We're coming with you.

831
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:13,640
Whoa, whoa, are you OK with this?

832
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:20,080
I couldn't stop them even
if I wanted to.

833
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:21,960
No detonation until we're sure

834
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:24,960
that the SAS Daleks have destroyed
all of Robertson's creations.

835
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:28,680
And before you're all clear
of the Dalek ship, obviously.

836
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:31,760
Obviously. We didn't come this far
just to get exterminated.

837
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,440
OK, boys. Hold tight.

838
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:38,560
Cos here we go.

839
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:41,440
Right.

840
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:48,120
OK, command centre is down that way.

841
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:50,560
Do not go that way. That's where
most of the Daleks will be.

842
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:52,400
Are you clear on what to do? Yeah.

843
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,600
Spread these things out
and don't get killed.

844
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:57,040
That's it. Good luck. Oh...

845
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:06,760
That's it, eh? Ryan, see, this is
our area of expertise.

846
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:08,840
First, the Cyber dudes,
now the Daleks -

847
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:11,360
no alien ship is safe from
us two bad boys.

848
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:17,480
What?

849
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,560
Stop talking weird, Graham.

850
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:24,280
Sorry.

851
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:30,320
Alert! Internal ship sensors report

852
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:32,960
non-Dalek life forms on board!

853
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:37,840
Seek, locate and exterminate
all non-Dalek life forms!

854
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:54,080
ROBERTSON: OK! Who's in charge here?

855
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:56,760
I only want to talk to the boss.

856
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:58,280
Speak!

857
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:05,080
Well, first of all, you need to know
that I'm on your side.

858
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:08,600
Now, to prove that, I can tell
you this -

859
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:10,800
you're all headed into a trap.

860
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:16,680
The person who summoned you,
she's called the Doctor.

861
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:20,120
The Doctor is an enemy of
the Dalek race!

862
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:23,240
I know. So, here's the deal.

863
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:26,760
You let me live,
I help you find her.

864
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,880
You've got to be kidding me!

865
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:32,760
Incoming emergency spatial shift!
Exterminate!

866
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:36,680
Do not exterminate. I am Dalek.
Halt!

867
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:40,520
We have exterminated all impurities!

868
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:44,280
You are the final
remaining impurity!

869
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:46,560
I am not impure.

870
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:49,600
I am a survivor -

871
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:53,600
the last remains
of a reconnaissance scout.

872
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:57,000
I surveyed this planet.

873
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,160
I attempted to alert the fleet.

874
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:04,960
I have served,
given my life for the Dalek cause.

875
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:07,960
But you are impure.

876
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:11,080
I can be purified.

877
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:14,640
My genetics can be modified.

878
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:17,800
There is only one purification.

879
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:19,960
Exterminate!

880
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:29,400
Argh! Jack, explosives all laid.
Good to go.

881
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:31,160
Sort of. What do you mean?

882
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:33,640
Doctor, I've got some good news
and some bad news.

883
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:35,200
OVER COMMS: The good news is

884
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,560
the last of Robertson's Daleks
has been destroyed.

885
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:39,680
Can we stop there
and pretend there's no bad news?

886
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:42,440
The bad news is Robertson
is negotiating with the Daleks

887
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:43,480
and has sold you out.

888
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:47,600
The Daleks know it was you
who brought them here, as a trap.

889
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:49,280
I knew I wouldn't like the bad news.

890
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:51,560
What do we do?

891
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:53,520
Right, just running
through the options...

892
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:55,920
..which hasn't taken long.

893
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:57,240
Even if we blow up the ship,

894
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,760
there's still SAS Daleks marauding
through Earth's skies,

895
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:02,280
and now they know I'm here!

896
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:04,120
So we have to keep you
out their way.

897
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:06,160
Or...

898
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:07,280
Or what?

899
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:10,080
Shh. Working.
Doctor, tell me.

900
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:12,000
You're going to have to trust me
on this, Yaz.

901
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
When have I ever let you down
before?

902
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:21,800
I won't disappear again.

903
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:23,760
Yeah, you will.

904
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:26,160
One day, you will.

905
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:33,320
Where are we?

906
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:35,520
Right, come here and monitor
this timer.

907
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:38,400
Jack, I need you to be ready to get
everyone off that ship and detonate.

908
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:39,560
Yaz will tell you when.

909
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:41,440
What about the other Daleks?

910
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:42,840
I'm dealing with them!

911
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:47,760
Hey.

912
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:49,120
I'm a bit lost.

913
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:51,760
Alert, alert!

914
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:53,840
Didn't sound good.
Do you want to get that?

915
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:55,640
Remain here.

916
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:58,960
All Dalek units,
report to central control.

917
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:01,360
The Doctor is detected!

918
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:04,200
Extermination formations, assemble!

919
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:05,800
TARDIS location identified!

920
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:09,200
Give us one good reason
why we should save your life.

921
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:10,440
Money?

922
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:12,800
I still say we should leave
him here. Yeah.

923
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:14,280
Exterminate!

924
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:15,720
Go!

925
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:19,520
The Doctor's TARDIS is located.
Surround the TARDIS!

926
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:23,600
Hey! Daleks!

927
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:26,560
Over here!
It is the Doctor!

928
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:28,840
The Doctor is
an enemy of the Daleks!

929
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:31,320
Yes, it is. And, yes, I am.

930
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:35,400
I called you here and you came,
like obedient little pets.

931
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:36,920
Thanks for solving my problem.

932
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:39,600
Daleks are not pets of the Doctor!

933
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:41,720
Yes, you are. Why?
What are you going to do about it?

934
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:43,760
Cos I'm just standing here,
in my TARDIS.

935
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:46,760
Attack the TARDIS!
Exterminate the Doctor!

936
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,280
You're sure this is the right way?

937
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:54,760
There's Daleks everywhere!
We've got to get us out of here.

938
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:56,000
DALEK: You are intruders!

939
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,320
This is a terrible rescue!

940
00:59:57,320 --> 01:00:00,160
DALEK: Intruders located!
Life forms identified!

941
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:01,640
We're surrounded!

942
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:03,720
DALEK 1: Do not move!
DALEK 2: Do not move!

943
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:06,000
Hey, are we ready? Do I detonate?

944
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,040
Almost. Grab hold.

945
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:09,960
Now, Jack! Get off the ship!

946
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:12,720
Intruders, identify!

947
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:16,800
I'm Captain Jack Harkness.
And I'm immortal. Ha!

948
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:18,880
Exterminate!

949
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:28,280
DALEK: Dalek craft destroyed!

950
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:30,040
Where is the Doctor?!

951
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:33,240
Search the TARDIS!
Exterminate the Doctor!

952
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:37,280
Oh, mate!
You fell for the old switcheroo.

953
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:40,040
Awkward. That's not my TARDIS.

954
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:41,840
I had a spare one lying around,

955
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:44,200
so I used the chameleon circuit to
make it look like mine,

956
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:45,400
and guess who fell for it?

957
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:46,520
You guys.

958
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:48,480
We shall find you!

959
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:51,160
We have control of a TARDIS!

960
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:54,280
No. You don't. Sorry.

961
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:58,200
More bad news. I've programmed it
to fold in on itself

962
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:01,080
and send itself to
the heart of the Void,

963
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:05,520
which will of course break it apart
and destroy you in the process.

964
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:06,960
Thanks for helping today.

965
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,480
Won't be seeing you later.

966
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:11,000
You will not escape us, Doctor!

967
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,680
Yes, I will. Every time.

968
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:29,480
Oh, that was horrible.
I feel sick.

969
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:31,000
What just happened to me?

970
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,160
Did we do it?

971
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:34,000
We did it!

972
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,240
Daleks all exiled.

973
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:38,160
Now, you have got
a lot of explaining to do.

974
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:43,840
I was deliberately acting
as a decoy.

975
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:50,160
They're calling him
the saviour of humanity,

976
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:52,840
the man who stood up to the invaders
on behalf of us all.

977
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:54,400
Now, as rumours intensify

978
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:57,320
that he may be in line
for an honorary knighthood,

979
01:01:57,320 --> 01:02:01,480
Jack Robertson spoke to me from
his home in the United States.

980
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:04,840
Emily, I did what any man -

981
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:08,040
person, human person -

982
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:11,160
would do in those circumstances.

983
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:14,640
There's even talk of
a revived presidential run for you.

984
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:18,720
Well, I can't really answer to that.

985
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:22,960
Can you believe that?
Yeah, I can.

986
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,000
We should go and meet the Doc.

987
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:38,280
Yeah.

988
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:43,600
Sorry, lost track of time.

989
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:45,280
Gwen Cooper sends her love,
by the way.

990
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:48,160
Says she took out a Dalek with
a moped and her son's boxing gloves.

991
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:49,240
Hoo-hoo!

992
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:52,200
Anyway, I'm going to stick around
on Earth and catch up with her.

993
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:53,240
I'll call ya.

994
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:56,400
Send my love to Gwen. OK, bye!

995
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:57,760
Right, fam,

996
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:00,800
I thought we could
try the Meringue Galaxy.

997
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:03,240
It's not a place, it's a restaurant

998
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:05,720
where every course is meringue.

999
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:07,680
And the furniture.

1000
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:11,080
Plus the waiters!
Love it!

1001
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:13,840
All set? Ready. Yep.

1002
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:18,560
Nah.

1003
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:24,360
I think I'm going to stay here.

1004
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:33,280
Yeah.

1005
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:35,200
Me mates need me.

1006
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:38,960
And I know this sounds stupid,
but...

1007
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:40,880
..I feel like my planet needs me.

1008
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,760
You've got to fight for it, right?

1009
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:47,840
Look, Doctor, before...

1010
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:50,960
..before I met you, I didn't know
what I wanted to do with me life.

1011
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:52,360
And...

1012
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:55,080
And now... And now, I know.

1013
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:03,640
Ten months.

1014
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:07,320
I made it back too late.

1015
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:10,200
Missed my time with you.

1016
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:14,080
So, are we hugging, or...?

1017
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:29,560
What about you two?
Are you going to...?

1018
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:31,280
Stay? Yeah, definitely.

1019
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:34,040
Yes!

1020
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:38,080
I'm not ready to let you go yet.

1021
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:39,680
That's all right, isn't it?

1022
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:42,440
You've said it now, so...

1023
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:47,320
Of course it's all right.
She needs you.

1024
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:50,800
Yes for Yaz! Hey.

1025
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:53,040
You're getting over me leaving
quick enough.

1026
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:54,400
Two hearts.

1027
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:57,280
One happy...

1028
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:00,160
..one sad.

1029
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:04,280
Make sure she doesn't get in
any trouble.

1030
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:06,760
It's going to be difficult.

1031
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:09,160
I'm holding you responsible
for the planet while I'm away.

1032
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:10,360
Yeah. Deal.

1033
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:12,840
Graham?

1034
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,880
Look, it's all right, you know.

1035
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:22,240
I'm all grown up now,
so...you can go with them.

1036
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:24,000
Yeah, well...

1037
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:29,000
Yeah, well, you know,
there's lots to explore,

1038
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,480
so much more to see.

1039
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:32,520
You know...

1040
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:35,320
But, um...

1041
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:39,800
I don't want to miss out on you,

1042
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:43,680
you know, and being here without you
ain't going to be...

1043
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:45,040
..the same.

1044
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:49,000
You know, I'll always
be looking around, then,

1045
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,080
to say stuff to you, you know?

1046
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:54,240
You see, Ryan, you're my family.

1047
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:58,320
And I remember, Doc,
what you said, you know,

1048
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:01,680
that we...we wouldn't come back
the same people, and you're right.

1049
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:05,120
Just not in the way I thought.

1050
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:09,960
I'm ready. I want to...

1051
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:12,160
I want to be at home
with my grandson.

1052
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:17,240
What?

1053
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:19,840
I just thought I'd have the place
to myself, you know.

1054
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:21,960
No such luck.

1055
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:26,160
Yaz.

1056
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:30,840
I'm sure I'll see you soon, eh?

1057
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:34,320
Keep doing humanity proud.

1058
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:36,320
I'm going to miss you.

1059
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:40,640
Doc.

1060
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:44,480
Thank you so much.

1061
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:46,640
Right...

1062
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:49,160
Well, come on, son.

1063
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:51,000
Hey...

1064
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:58,560
Bye, fam.

1065
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:03,120
Yeah.

1066
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:08,760
Right...

1067
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:13,120
Wait.

1068
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:21,040
Take these. Might come in handy.

1069
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:23,720
Oh. Ta.

1070
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:29,360
Oh!

1071
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:32,280
And, Doc, I was wrong.

1072
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:35,560
We do get aliens in Sheffield.

1073
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:48,400
I could always use the TARDIS to go
back, arrive an hour after you guys,

1074
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:49,760
change the timeline.

1075
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:53,760
Then we'd have more time together.

1076
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:57,200
It's OK to be sad.

1077
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:10,440
OK, three, two,

1078
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:12,880
one, go!

1079
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:15,120
Yes, go on, Ryan!

1080
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:16,600
You're doing it, son!

1081
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:18,600
Go on, son!

1082
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:20,520
Come on!

1083
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:25,000
All right.

1084
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:28,600
Ryan, you OK, son?

1085
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:29,800
Yeah. Yeah? Yeah.

1086
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:33,160
Well, look, definitely further.

1087
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:36,040
Yeah. Maybe.
No, definitely.

1088
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:38,000
I was looking online earlier...

1089
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:42,520
Some weird stuff going
on in a village in Finland.

1090
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:45,040
Troll invasion,
so the locals are saying.

1091
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:46,880
Yeah, I saw that.

1092
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:50,360
And, you know, there's a quarry
in Korea that's shut down

1093
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:51,840
because the workers are reporting

1094
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:53,520
they saw gravel creatures
come to life.

1095
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:02,640
Psychic paper.

1096
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:04,920
Yeah. These will get us in anywhere.

1097
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:06,480
Yeah, Finland, Korea...

1098
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:09,160
Well, then, what are we waiting for?
I'm not done here yet.

1099
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:11,480
Yeah, but, look... I mean, this...

1100
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:13,280
You'll be black and blue.

1101
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:16,520
I don't know if you heard about me,
but I'm Ryan Sinclair.

1102
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:19,240
Me and me mates,
we saw off everything

1103
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:22,440
from giant spiders
to a conscious universe.

1104
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:25,120
We fought Cybermen,

1105
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:27,720
Skithra, Morax...

1106
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:29,000
..the mighty Pting.

1107
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:33,280
It's going to take more
than a bike to scare me off.

1108
01:09:33,280 --> 01:09:36,560
Ain't that right, Grandad?

1109
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:38,080
Yeah.

1110
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:40,800
Right, then.
Well, come on, then. Jump on, then.

1111
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:49,200
You all right? Yeah.

1112
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:12,840
You all right? Yeah.

1113
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:16,160
Yeah, uh,
just got the sun in me eyes.

1114
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:17,520
Yeah, me too.

1115
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:21,920
Right, a few more tries
and we'll go and save the world, eh?

1116
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:23,640
Yeah. Yeah.

1117
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:25,880
Here we go, get ready.

1118
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:27,880
Three, two, one...

1119
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:30,000
Go! Go on, Ryan.

1120
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,520
Yeah! Go on, son!

1121
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:34,040
You're doing it, mate!
