他是个好律师，大家都很喜欢他
He's a good lawyer and he's well liked

00:00:03,391 --> 00:00:04,391
耶稣基督!

00:00:07,277 --> 00:00:08,757
这是门。给我两分钟。
That's the door. Give me two minutes.

4
00:00:10,066 --> 00:00:13,162
我们刚听说亚历克斯·加尔布雷斯被枪杀了。
We've just heard that Alex Galbraith has been shot dead.

5
00:00:13,186 --> 00:00:17,195

There's a very good chance that his wife is going to be our next MP.

6
00:00:17,222 --> 00:00:19,302
岛上的每个人都在某个时候遇到过他。
Everybody on the isles came across him at some point.

7
00:00:19,326 --> 00:00:20,842
有一场监护权之争。
There was a custody battle.

8
00:00:20,866 --> 00:00:23,522
妻子因为吸毒而失去了孩子。
The wife lost her kids due to drug addiction.

9
00:00:23,546 --> 00:00:26,082
——琳达莫顿?-他们在问亚历克斯·加尔布雷斯的事?
- Lynda Morton? - They were asking about Alex Galbraith?

10
00:00:26,106 --> 00:00:27,882
你最好别提我的名字
You better not have mentioned my name

11
00:00:27,906 --> 00:00:29,402
谈话的任何部分
in any part of that conversation.

12
00:00:29,426 --> 00:00:32,442
有个小问题。当地的小伙子。弗雷泽克雷根。
Got a wee problem. Local lad. Fraser Creggan.

13
00:00:32,466 --> 00:00:35,081
他一直在网上发布加尔布雷斯谋杀案的消息。
He's been posting about the Galbraith killing online.

14
00:00:35,106 --> 00:00:37,282
我们有洛根·克雷根。
We've got a Logan Creggan.

15
00:00:37,306 --> 00:00:38,722
在我们的枪支拥有者名册上
On our register of gun owners.

16
00:00:38,746 --> 00:00:40,344
唐娜·基利克的事让我很生气
I am pissed off about Donna Killick.

17
00:00:40,368 --> 00:00:42,208
她杀了我妹妹，还能回家
She kills my sister, and then gets to come home

18
00:00:42,232 --> 00:00:43,562
-死在自己的床上?——妈妈。
- to die in her own bed? - Mum.

19
00:00:43,586 --> 00:00:45,722
你丈夫用无人机做什么?
What does your husband use the drone for?

20
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:47,802
他开着飞机在海岸上来回飞行。
He was out flying it up and down the coast.

21
00:00:47,826 --> 00:00:49,482
你真的要这么做吗?
You really have to take this dive?

22
00:00:49,506 --> 00:00:50,842
我有B计划。
I've got a plan B.

23
00:00:50,866 --> 00:00:52,922
那是你的选择，但你会后悔的。
Well, that's your choice, but you'll regret it.

24
00:00:52,946 --> 00:00:54,402
他们把他们带回来了。
They're bringing them back up.

25
00:00:54,426 --> 00:00:56,482
冠军宝座。设得兰警局想和你谈谈。
Eamon. Shetland Police want to talk to you.

26
00:00:58,106 --> 00:00:59,522
我们正在失去压力。
We're losing pressure.

27
00:01:52,031 --> 00:01:54,567
小锚夫人吗?我是贝德福德博士
Mrs Killick? I'm Dr Bedford,

28
00:01:54,591 --> 00:01:56,767
勒威克综合医院的顾问。

29
00:01:56,791 --> 00:01:58,551
这是梅格·帕蒂森护士。

30
00:02:00,484 --> 00:02:02,044
欢迎回到设得兰群岛。
Welcome back to Shetland.

31
00:02:08,831 --> 00:02:10,644
正确的。我们该走了。
Right. We should get going.

32
00:02:13,071 --> 00:02:14,751
你好的。
You OK.

33
00:02:22,111 --> 00:02:23,524
他怎么了?
What happened to him?

34
00:02:26,111 --> 00:02:28,884
埃蒙的减压器出了点问题。
There was a problem with Eamon's decompression.

35
00:02:31,391 --> 00:02:32,711
耶稣。
Jesus.

36
00:02:34,751 --> 00:02:35,991
如果那个房间爆炸了……
If that chamber blew...

37
00:02:37,711 --> 00:02:39,764
他会很痛苦的。
he would have been in so much pain.

38
00:02:42,391 --> 00:02:44,831
柯斯蒂，我知道这很难…
Kirsty, I know this is hard, erm...

39
00:02:45,951 --> 00:02:48,404
我要问你几个问题。
I'm going to have to ask you a few questions.

40
00:02:50,471 --> 00:02:54,244
在埃蒙去上班之前，他怎么样?
Before Eamon left to go to work, how was he?

41
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:58,207
这是他第一次情绪这么好。
For once he was in good spirits.

42
00:02:58,231 --> 00:03:00,164
他走之前说什么了吗?
Did he say anything before he left?

43
00:03:02,591 --> 00:03:05,724
他说他有备用计划。
He said he had a plan B.

44
00:03:06,951 --> 00:03:08,967
你知道他是什么意思吗?
Do you know what he meant by that?

45
00:03:09,424 --> 00:03:10,904
我不知道。
I've no idea.

46
00:03:15,991 --> 00:03:17,764
你会知道发生了什么事?
You'll find out what happened?

47
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:19,884
我会尽我所能。
I'll do everything I can.

48
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:40,127
她只是停靠。
She's just docked.

49
00:03:40,151 --> 00:03:42,727
这是康纳·麦凯。康纳被任命的
This is Connor McKay. Connor's been appointed

50
00:03:42,751 --> 00:03:46,064
由工业安全管理局调查事故。
by the Industrial Safety Authority to investigate the accident.

51
00:03:46,337 --> 00:03:48,539
很明显，这事由你们来主导，
Obviously, you guys are going to take the lead on this,

52
00:03:48,571 --> 00:03:52,293
但高迪是一起谋杀案的潜在证人。
but Gauldie was a potential witness in a murder investigation.

53
00:03:52,317 --> 00:03:55,573
所以我希望，你知道，我们可以合作。
So I'm hoping that, you know, we could work together.

54
00:03:55,597 --> 00:03:57,893
当然可以。你会第一个看到我们的发现。
Of course. You'll be the first to see our findings.

55
00:03:57,917 --> 00:03:59,031
是的,你看,
Yeah, you see,

56
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:02,613
我真不想坐着等着看报告。
I don't really want to sit about and wait to read a report.

57
00:04:02,637 --> 00:04:05,453
我要进入事故现场
I want access to the accident scene

58
00:04:05,477 --> 00:04:06,984
还有所有的证据。
and all the evidence.

59
00:04:07,117 --> 00:04:09,397
-财政部门必须澄清这一点。——啊。她已经有了。
- Fiscal will have to clear that. - Aye. She already has.

60
00:04:12,957 --> 00:04:14,157
好的。
OK.

61
00:04:18,643 --> 00:04:19,979
财政部门批准了吗?
Has the Fiscal cleared it?

62
00:04:20,004 --> 00:04:22,204
不。所以我需要你打电话给她。
No. That's why I need you to call her.

63
00:04:29,777 --> 00:04:31,724
大部分船员都被撤职了。
Most of the crew's been stood down.

64
00:04:32,451 --> 00:04:34,787
每个人都还在震惊中。
Everyone's still in shock.

65
00:04:35,277 --> 00:04:37,757
我整理了一份事故的录像给你看。
I've lined up a recording of the accident for you to view.

66
00:04:40,517 --> 00:04:44,644
8点20分，埃蒙转移到一个单独的空房间。
At 8:20, Eamon transfers in to a separate unoccupied chamber.

67
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:46,906
在他转院18分钟后
18 minutes after he transferred,

68
00:04:46,931 --> 00:04:48,667
压力大幅下降。
there's a massive drop in pressure.

69
00:04:48,692 --> 00:04:50,748
外部阀门的破裂。
A breach of an external valve.

70
00:04:50,997 --> 00:04:54,173
我们试着把它从这里分离出来，但它没有反应。
We tried to isolate it from in here but it wouldn't respond.

71
00:04:54,197 --> 00:04:58,053
谁是负责潜水员的生命支持主管?
Who was the Life Support Supervisor responsible for the divers?

72
00:04:58,077 --> 00:05:01,253
我。和米克·穆尔。
Me. And Mick Muir.

73
00:05:01,277 --> 00:05:04,013
米克在他的小屋里。他感觉不舒服。
Mick's in his cabin. He's not feeling well.

74
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:07,957
我让米克去手动关闭外部阀门，但是…
I sent Mick out to try and close the external valve manually but...

75
00:05:09,797 --> 00:05:11,853
但他没能及时赶到。
But he didn't make it in time.

76
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:13,878
是什么造成了缺口?
What caused the breach?

77
00:05:15,303 --> 00:05:17,559
阀门一定是松了，造成了泄漏。
The valve must have came loose which caused a leak.

78
00:05:17,637 --> 00:05:19,733
它为什么松了?
Why did it come loose?

79
00:05:19,757 --> 00:05:21,133
我们不知道。
We don't know.

80
00:05:21,157 --> 00:05:24,453
我们做了所有的潜水前检查，一切都很安全。
We did all the pre-dive checks and everything was secure.

81
00:05:24,477 --> 00:05:26,253
你检查过了吗?
Did you do the checks?

82
00:05:26,277 --> 00:05:27,637
米克把他们抬了出去。
Mick carried them out.

83
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:31,266
弄松有多容易?
How easy is it to loosen that?

84
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:32,615
你什么意思?
What do you mean?

85
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,324
我的意思是，
Well, what I mean is,

86
00:05:34,457 --> 00:05:37,164
会不会是有人进来用手把它解开的?
could someone have come in here and loosened it by hand?

87
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:41,844
是啊，但他们为什么要这么做?
Well, aye, but why would they?

88
00:05:50,175 --> 00:05:51,631
你认为这是故意的吗?
Do you think this was deliberate?

89
00:05:51,655 --> 00:05:54,671
高迪是最接近目击证人的人
Gauldie was the closest thing we had to a witness

90
00:05:54,695 --> 00:05:57,791
我们还没来得及跟他说话他就死了。
and he dies minutes before we're due to speak to him.

91
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:59,665
去设得兰的加尔布雷斯是一回事，
Getting to Galbraith in Shetland is one thing,

92
00:05:59,689 --> 00:06:02,671
但凶手是怎么上船去杀高迪的?
but how did the killer get on board to kill Gauldie?

93
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:05,151
可能不止一个凶手?
Could be more than one killer?

94
00:06:05,175 --> 00:06:09,111
杀了加尔布雷斯的人找了别人去杀高迪。
Whoever killed Galbraith got someone else to kill Gauldie.

95
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:10,471
在船上工作的人。
Somebody who works on the ship.

96
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:13,791
那我们说的就是有关系，有钱，有资源的人。
Then we're talking about someone with connections, money, resources.

97
00:06:13,815 --> 00:06:16,111
跟所有能进入潜水室的人谈谈
Talk to everybody who had access to the dive chamber

98
00:06:16,135 --> 00:06:17,684
但先从米克·缪尔开始。
but start with Mick Muir.

99
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:24,455
好的。
OK.

100
00:06:25,575 --> 00:06:27,055
很容易。
Nice and easy.

101
00:06:29,834 --> 00:06:31,474
能帮帮忙吗?
Any chance of some help?

102
00:06:34,487 --> 00:06:37,084
我接到的命令是护送她回家。
My orders were to escort her to the house.

103
00:06:38,294 --> 00:06:39,774
我所做的。
I've done that.

104
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,031
嘿。
Hey.

105
00:06:47,181 --> 00:06:48,941
你到底是怎么了?
What the hell is wrong with you?

106
00:06:49,735 --> 00:06:52,164
这位女士的癌症已经到了第四阶段。
The woman has stage four cancer.

107
00:06:52,935 --> 00:06:55,591
-你对她了解多少?-我知道她快死了
- What do you know about her? - I know that she's dying.

108
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:57,911
她需要一点同情。
And she could do with a bit of compassion.

109
00:06:57,935 --> 00:06:59,335
这是多娜小锚。
That's Donna Killick.

110
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:05,871
她杀了一个18岁的女孩，我的一个朋友，
She murdered an 18-year-old girl, a friend of mine,

111
00:07:05,895 --> 00:07:08,911
然后她让一个无辜的人坐了20年牢
and then she let an innocent man spend 20 years in jail

112
00:07:08,935 --> 00:07:10,095
为她的罪行。
for her crime.

113
00:07:11,495 --> 00:07:13,055
我有足够的同情心……
I've got plenty of compassion...

114
00:07:14,255 --> 00:07:15,375
但对她来说并非如此。
but not for her.

115
00:07:30,935 --> 00:07:33,031
潜水前我检查了所有的阀门。
I checked all the valves before the dive.

116
00:07:33,055 --> 00:07:34,351
他们每个人都很安全。
Every one of them was secure.

117
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:37,071
-那是什么造成的?-我不知道。
- So then, what caused the breach? - I don't know.

118
00:07:37,095 --> 00:07:38,671
这不是会发生的事。
It's not something that happens.

119
00:07:38,974 --> 00:07:40,254
永远。
Ever.

120
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:43,631
可能是密封坏了，或者阀门出了故障。
Maybe the seal broke or the valve malfunctioned.

121
00:07:43,741 --> 00:07:46,101
或者是有人手动解开的?
Or maybe someone loosened it manually?

122
00:07:47,055 --> 00:07:48,671
好吧，那不是我。
Well, it wasnae me.

123
00:07:48,695 --> 00:07:50,631
拉森告诉你是我了吗?
Did Larson tell you it was me?

124
00:07:50,655 --> 00:07:52,575
因为你要知道我和他合不来。
Because you need to know me and him don't get on.

125
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:54,311
你和高迪处得好吗?
Did you and Gauldie get on?

126
00:07:54,335 --> 00:07:55,991
我和埃蒙没有问题。
I had no problem with Eamon.

127
00:07:56,015 --> 00:07:58,615
其他船员呢?他们和他有过节吗?
What about the rest of the crew? Any of them have issues with him?

128
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,231
不。他很讨人喜欢。
No. He was pretty well liked.

129
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:02,404
你没见过他和别人吵架吗?
You never saw him arguing with anyone?

130
00:08:03,695 --> 00:08:05,557
他进密室的前一晚，
The night before he got in the chamber,

131
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:07,748
我听到他在电话里跟人诉苦。
I heard him giving somebody grief over the phone.

132
00:08:07,772 --> 00:08:10,311
他说是他妻子。我从来不相信他。
He said it was his wife. I never believed him.

133
00:08:10,335 --> 00:08:12,391
-你为什么不相信他?-我不知道。
- Why didn't you believe him? - I don't know.

134
00:08:12,415 --> 00:08:14,644
他只是听起来像在和他妻子说话。
He just didnae sound like he was talking to his wife.

135
00:08:15,335 --> 00:08:16,991
如果埃蒙有什么问题
If Eamon had a problem,

136
00:08:17,561 --> 00:08:19,121
他会和谁说话?
who would he talk to?

137
00:08:19,855 --> 00:08:22,031
也许是凯莉·麦克安德鲁。
Err, Carrie McAndrew maybe.

138
00:08:22,055 --> 00:08:24,535
她是厨师。她和埃蒙是好朋友。
She's the chef. Her and Eamon were pally.

139
00:08:25,721 --> 00:08:27,121
正确的。
Right.

140
00:08:32,935 --> 00:08:34,964
凯特。这是桑迪。
Kate. It's Sandy.

141
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:37,591
她是今天早上到的。
She arrived this morning.

142
00:08:37,615 --> 00:08:39,204
我想你会想知道。
I thought you'd want to know.

143
00:08:39,815 --> 00:08:41,135
有空给我打电话。好吗?
Call me when you can. OK?

144
00:08:42,415 --> 00:08:44,511
你和唐娜·基利克谈得怎么样?
How did it get on with Donna Killick?

145
00:08:44,764 --> 00:08:46,911
我刚把她送到她家。
I just dropped her off at her house.

146
00:08:46,935 --> 00:08:48,844
-她怎么样?——她很好。
- And how was she? - She's fine.

147
00:08:49,967 --> 00:08:52,623
有个医生和护士跟在她后面
She's got a doctor and a nurse running around after her

148
00:08:52,695 --> 00:08:54,175
就像她是什么名人一样。
like she's some sort of celebrity.

149
00:08:57,167 --> 00:08:58,407
正确的。
Right.

150
00:09:00,815 --> 00:09:02,724
找到高迪的无人机了吗?
Any luck finding Gauldie's drone?

151
00:09:02,749 --> 00:09:04,205
还没有。
Not yet.

152
00:09:04,415 --> 00:09:07,191
但技术人员认为我们应该找的是SD卡
But the tech boys reckon it's the SD card we should be looking for

153
00:09:07,215 --> 00:09:08,671
而不是无人机。
and not the drone.

154
00:09:08,695 --> 00:09:10,391
卡片是存储数据的地方
The card is where the data is stored

155
00:09:10,415 --> 00:09:13,271
埃蒙可能在无人机被偷之前就把它拿走了。
and Eamon may have taken it out before the drone was stolen.

156
00:09:13,295 --> 00:09:16,604
好的。跟柯斯蒂·高迪谈谈看她知不知道它在哪。
OK. Well talk to Kirsty Gauldie and see if she knows where it is.

157
00:09:17,735 --> 00:09:19,044
啊。吉米,
Ah. Jimmy,

158
00:09:19,415 --> 00:09:21,951
刚接到因弗内斯媒体官员的电话。
just had a call from the media officer in Inverness.

159
00:09:21,975 --> 00:09:25,391
基尔缪尔的犯罪现场照片引起了轩然大波。
Those Kilmuir crime scene photos are causing a big stooshie.

160
00:09:25,415 --> 00:09:28,471
唐尼查出是谁发的原始照片了吗?
Has Donnie worked out who posted the original images?

161
00:09:28,495 --> 00:09:30,311
他说他正在努力。
Says he's working on it.

162
00:09:30,335 --> 00:09:32,151
所以,很明显,
So, apparently,

163
00:09:32,175 --> 00:09:35,311
我今早授权进入一个事故现场。
I authorised access to an accident scene this morning.

164
00:09:35,335 --> 00:09:37,191
问题是，我不记得做过。
Thing is, I don't remember doing it.

165
00:09:37,215 --> 00:09:40,111
事实上，我甚至不记得有人提过要求。
In fact, I don't even remember someone making a request.

166
00:09:40,135 --> 00:09:41,271
我们试过给你打电话。
Well, we tried to call you.

167
00:09:41,295 --> 00:09:43,271
哦,好吧。至少你试过了。
Oh, well. Least you tried.

168
00:09:43,295 --> 00:09:46,311
我得上那艘船。我们没有时间等了。
I needed to get on that ship. We didn't have time to wait.

169
00:09:46,748 --> 00:09:48,188
我很抱歉。
I'm sorry.

170
00:09:51,294 --> 00:09:53,750
康纳·麦凯说你认为高迪是被谋杀的。
Connor McKay says you think Gauldie was murdered.

171
00:09:53,775 --> 00:09:56,231
如果戴高迪目击了加尔布雷斯被杀
If Gauldie witnessed Galbraith's murder,

172
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:58,991
也许凶手在他开口之前就杀了他。
then maybe the shooter got to him before he could talk.

173
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,551
在北海的中央?
In the middle of the North Sea?

174
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:02,191
我们正在研究一个理论
We're working on a theory that

175
00:10:02,215 --> 00:10:04,871
枪手派人在船上下手。
the shooter got someone on board the ship to do it.

176
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:08,551
这提醒了我。桑迪，盯着琳达·莫顿。
Which reminds me. Sandy, keep an eye on Lynda Morton.

177
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:10,611
我想知道最近有谁来看过她。
I want to know who's been visiting her recently.

178
00:10:10,635 --> 00:10:12,151
对不起,琳达莫顿?
Sorry, Lynda Morton?

179
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:15,711
琳达的前夫是加尔布雷斯的客户。
Lynda's ex-husband was a client of Galbraith's.

180
00:10:16,084 --> 00:10:17,471
加尔布雷斯的笔记,
In Galbraith's notes,

181
00:10:17,495 --> 00:10:21,111
他指控琳达与毒贩勾结。
he accused Lynda of associating with drug dealers.

182
00:10:21,364 --> 00:10:23,271
对不起。比利…
Sorry. Billy...

183
00:10:23,644 --> 00:10:27,071
我需要最近每一起毒品逮捕案的细节。
I need the details of every recent drug arrest.

184
00:10:27,095 --> 00:10:29,484
与大陆黑帮有联系的毒贩。
Dealers linked with mainland gangs.

185
00:10:31,284 --> 00:10:33,391
如果加尔布雷斯是对的，
If Galbraith was right,

186
00:10:33,415 --> 00:10:37,231
琳达和一些严重的罪犯混在一起。
then Lynda was mixing with some serious criminals.

187
00:10:37,255 --> 00:10:39,991
加尔布雷斯不是谋杀。
Galbraith wasn't murdered.

188
00:10:40,484 --> 00:10:42,031
他被暗杀。
He was assassinated.

189
00:10:42,644 --> 00:10:45,311
他们用的是无法追踪的枪。
They used an untraceable gun.

190
00:10:45,335 --> 00:10:46,831
他们使用幽灵子弹。
They used ghost bullets.

191
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:50,831
所有这些都需要资源和组织，
Now all of that takes resources and organisation,

192
00:10:50,855 --> 00:10:52,911
这正是你想要的
which is exactly what you want

193
00:10:52,935 --> 00:10:55,895
如果你想在海上杀死目击证人。
if you're looking to kill a witness at sea.

194
00:10:58,988 --> 00:11:02,388
下次，你等着我回答。
Next time, you wait for an answer.

195
00:11:03,495 --> 00:11:04,655
理解。
Understood.

196
00:11:30,487 --> 00:11:31,647
琳达莫顿?
Lynda Morton?

197
00:11:35,284 --> 00:11:36,511
我已经告诉你的同事了
I already told your colleague,

198
00:11:36,535 --> 00:11:38,775
我不知道亚历克斯·加尔布雷斯怎么了。
I don't know what happened to Alex Galbraith.

199
00:11:41,481 --> 00:11:43,281
好的。埃蒙·高迪呢?
OK. What about Eamon Gauldie?

200
00:11:45,368 --> 00:11:46,728
谁?
Who?

201
00:11:49,641 --> 00:11:52,601
你吸毒有多久了?
How long have you had a drug problem for?

202
00:11:54,535 --> 00:11:56,511
我出了车祸。
I was in a car crash.

203
00:11:57,074 --> 00:11:58,674
两年前。
Two years ago.

204
00:11:59,621 --> 00:12:02,821
我的腿受伤了，所以他们给我吃了止痛药。
My leg got smashed up so they put me on painkillers.

205
00:12:04,835 --> 00:12:06,275
那些真的很好的。
The really good ones.

206
00:12:11,608 --> 00:12:14,168
不知不觉间，我一天都离不开它们。
Before I knew it, I couldn't get through the day without them.

207
00:12:15,855 --> 00:12:18,871
然后我变得很沮丧。和…
Then I got depressed. And...

208
00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:23,111
而不是问我是否需要帮助，我的前任只是…
instead of asking me if I needed any help, my ex just...

209
00:12:24,004 --> 00:12:28,655
以此为借口甩了我，带走了我的孩子们。
used it as an excuse to dump me and take my boys.

210
00:12:34,474 --> 00:12:36,274
现在我只有那些药了。
Now all I have are the pills.

211
00:12:38,415 --> 00:12:40,431
这让我想到了你们的经销商。
Which brings me to your dealers.

212
00:12:40,455 --> 00:12:42,191
我没有毒贩。
I don't have dealers.

213
00:12:42,215 --> 00:12:43,951
亚历克斯·加尔布雷斯认为你做到了。
Alex Galbraith thought you did.

214
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:45,831
他的证据。
He had evidence.

215
00:12:46,484 --> 00:12:48,431
当然，我们不知道证据是什么，
Of course, we don't know what that evidence was,

216
00:12:48,455 --> 00:12:50,751
因为他家里的文件被偷了。
because the file was stolen from his house.

217
00:12:50,775 --> 00:12:52,751
是啊，那跟我一点关系都没有。
Yeah, and that was nothing to do with me.

218
00:12:52,775 --> 00:12:54,471
也许不是你偷的
Maybe you didn't steal it,

219
00:12:54,495 --> 00:12:56,215
但我打赌你知道是谁干的
but I'm betting that you know who did.

220
00:12:57,655 --> 00:13:00,511
我知道你很害怕。我知道。但你的这些朋友
I know you're scared. I know. But these friends of yours,

221
00:13:00,535 --> 00:13:02,751
他们可能不仅仅是破门而入。
they might have done more than just break into a house.

222
00:13:02,775 --> 00:13:05,935
如果你告诉我他们的名字，我就能保护你。
So if you give me their names, then I can protect you.

223
00:13:11,881 --> 00:13:13,201
我需要你离开。
I need you to leave.

224
00:13:21,721 --> 00:13:24,004
那是等你改变主意时用的。
That's for when you change your mind.

225
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:52,071
我要把它搬出公寓。
I want it out of the flat.

226
00:13:52,404 --> 00:13:53,590
我们已经谈过了。
We've been through this.

227
00:13:53,614 --> 00:13:56,751
没有，警察又来了。那家伙佩雷斯。
No, the police were round again. That guy Perez.

228
00:13:56,981 --> 00:13:58,461
他问的是…
And he was asking about...

229
00:13:59,495 --> 00:14:02,215
他在问加尔布雷斯家被闯入的事。
He was asking about the break-in at Galbraith's house.

230
00:14:03,295 --> 00:14:05,524
如果他回来搜查那地方怎么办?
What if he comes back and searches the place?

231
00:14:05,549 --> 00:14:08,005
这不是我的错，我不会进监狱的。
I can't take the blame for this, OK, I'm not going to prison.

232
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,990
耶稣。你能冷静一下吗?
Jesus. Will you calm down?

233
00:14:11,855 --> 00:14:13,951
给我点时间再找个地方。
Give me some time to sort another place.

234
00:14:14,324 --> 00:14:16,791
回家了。在那儿等我。
Go home. Wait for me there.

235
00:14:16,815 --> 00:14:18,471
别担心。
Don't worry.

236
00:14:18,495 --> 00:14:20,404
就好了。
It'll be OK.

237
00:14:31,015 --> 00:14:34,135
这是过去六个月里所有重要的毒品逮捕记录。
That's every significant drugs arrest in the last six months.

238
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:39,951
米克·穆尔。你听说过他吗?
Mick Muir. You heard of him?

239
00:14:40,364 --> 00:14:42,311
不，不记得了。他是谁?
No, doesnae ring a bell. Who is he?

240
00:14:42,335 --> 00:14:47,591
可能就是他造成了埃蒙·高迪所谓的意外。
Could be he's the guy who caused Eamon Gauldie's supposed accident.

241
00:14:47,615 --> 00:14:49,431
调查一下他的背景
Do a background check on him.

242
00:14:49,684 --> 00:14:52,351
看看他和我们要找的人有没有关系
See if he's linked to anybody that we're looking at

243
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:54,271
-在加尔布雷斯的案子里——好的,当然。
- in the Galbraith case. - OK, sure.

244
00:15:00,164 --> 00:15:01,351
邓肯?
Duncan?

245
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,944
你告诉你爸爸你今天带他去吃午饭了吗?
Did you tell your Dad that you'd take him for lunch today?

246
00:15:03,968 --> 00:15:05,711
什么?不。
What? No.

247
00:15:05,735 --> 00:15:07,431
为什么?他说了什么?
Why? What's he saying?

248
00:15:07,455 --> 00:15:09,951
你今天要带他去吃午饭。
That you're taking him for lunch today.

249
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:12,191
在斯卡洛威旅馆。
At The Scalloway Hotel.

250
00:15:12,215 --> 00:15:14,471
是在斯卡洛威旅馆。
At The Scalloway Hotel, no less.

251
00:15:14,495 --> 00:15:16,711
不…不。他很困惑。
No... no. He's confused.

252
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,204
呃…
Er...

253
00:15:19,015 --> 00:15:20,551
把他。
put him on.

254
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,191
吉米?
Jimmy?

255
00:15:22,215 --> 00:15:23,735
你在哪里?我等待。
Where are you? I'm waiting.

256
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:27,231
爸爸。我从没说过我们今天要出去吃午饭。
Dad. I never said that we were going to go out and have lunch today.

257
00:15:27,484 --> 00:15:28,831
什么?
What?

258
00:15:29,164 --> 00:15:33,511
我从没说过我们要去吃午饭。
I-I never said that we were going to go and have lunch.

259
00:15:33,795 --> 00:15:36,835
我在工作中。我走不开。
I'm at work. I can't get away.

260
00:15:39,844 --> 00:15:41,311
爸爸?
Dad?

261
00:15:41,461 --> 00:15:42,941
它,是我。
It, it's me.

262
00:15:44,935 --> 00:15:48,031
我从没说过要带他出去。
I never said that I was going to take him out.

263
00:15:48,055 --> 00:15:51,391
我不知道他从哪学来的。
Er, I don't know where he's got that from.

264
00:15:51,871 --> 00:15:54,271
对了,听。没事的。我要把它咬一口
Right, listen. It's, it's all right. I'll take him for a bite

265
00:15:54,295 --> 00:15:56,015
在城市的某个地方。就大。
in town somewhere. It'll be grand.

266
00:15:57,255 --> 00:15:59,775
-你确定吗?——啊,啊。确定。
- Are you sure? - Aye, aye. Sure.

267
00:16:00,815 --> 00:16:02,415
好的。谢谢,邓肯。
OK. Thanks, Duncan.

268
00:16:07,255 --> 00:16:08,495
一切都好吧?
Everything all right?

269
00:16:09,655 --> 00:16:11,671
很好。是什么问题?
Fine. What's the problem?

270
00:16:11,695 --> 00:16:13,591
你要的加尔布雷斯时间线。
The Galbraith timeline you asked for.

271
00:16:13,615 --> 00:16:14,951
有三个小时的时间
There's a three-hour window

272
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:17,551
就在他被枪击的前一天，我们无法解释。
in the day before he was shot that we can't account for.

273
00:16:17,575 --> 00:16:19,151
你跟菲奥娜·贝德福德谈过了吗?
You speak to Fiona Bedford?

274
00:16:19,175 --> 00:16:21,511
她也不知道他在做什么。
She has no idea what he was doing either.

275
00:16:22,004 --> 00:16:25,391
他似乎在1点到4点之间消失了。
Seems he dropped off the radar between one and four o'clock.

276
00:16:25,834 --> 00:16:27,674
好吧。我会和伊芙谈谈。
All right. I'll speak to Eve.

277
00:16:48,055 --> 00:16:49,631
一种药物?
A drug hit?

278
00:16:51,924 --> 00:16:53,351
你是认真的吗?
Are you serious?

279
00:16:53,764 --> 00:16:55,615
我们正在跟进这件事。
It's something we're following up on.

280
00:16:57,015 --> 00:17:00,055
亚历克斯跟你提过毒品的事吗?
Did Alex ever mention anything about drugs to you?

281
00:17:02,284 --> 00:17:04,951
不，我不记得了。
No, not that I remember.

282
00:17:04,975 --> 00:17:06,671
我应该担心吗?我应该……
Should I be worried? Should I...

283
00:17:06,695 --> 00:17:08,591
我该把莫兰带出这房子吗?
should I be getting Merran out of this house?

284
00:17:08,615 --> 00:17:10,484
你的保护人员来了。
Your protection officers are here.

285
00:17:11,855 --> 00:17:14,495
但如果你想的话，我可以安排一个安全屋。
But I can arrange a safe house if that's what you want.

286
00:17:15,888 --> 00:17:19,655
不…不，让她回家已经够难的了。
No... No, it was hard enough getting her to come home.

287
00:17:19,964 --> 00:17:22,071
如果……如果我们再走，她会寸步不离的。
If... if we leave again, she'll dig her heels in.

288
00:17:23,495 --> 00:17:25,951
他们来了。我能出去吗?
The guys are here. Can I go out?

289
00:17:26,284 --> 00:17:28,351
我宁愿你跟我在一起。
I'd rather you stayed close.

290
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:30,255
我们正要去海滩。
We're just going down to the beach.

291
00:17:31,655 --> 00:17:34,775
好的。保持联系，莫兰。
OK. Just keep in touch, Merran.

292
00:17:35,995 --> 00:17:38,051
你走之前还有一件事。
Er, just one thing before you go.

293
00:17:38,076 --> 00:17:41,092
有件事我想问你和你妈妈。
There was something that I wanted to ask you and your mum.

294
00:17:41,175 --> 00:17:44,631
我们无法确定你父亲的下落
We're having trouble accounting for your Dad's whereabouts

295
00:17:44,655 --> 00:17:46,551
就在他死的前一天
on the day before he died.

296
00:17:47,084 --> 00:17:48,431
你们俩谁都知道
Either of you have any idea

297
00:17:48,455 --> 00:17:50,711
下午他在哪里?
where he was during the afternoon?

298
00:17:50,735 --> 00:17:52,631
他没在上班?
He wasn't at work?

299
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:54,991
菲奥娜·贝德福德说没有。
Fiona Bedford says no.

300
00:17:55,724 --> 00:17:57,071
Merran吗?
Merran?

301
00:17:57,484 --> 00:17:58,735
我在学校。
I was at school.

302
00:18:00,568 --> 00:18:02,968
你爸爸有没有提到他那天在做什么?
Did your Dad happen to mention what he was doing that day?

303
00:18:04,888 --> 00:18:06,168
他什么也没说。
He never said anything.

304
00:18:13,314 --> 00:18:14,994
我能感觉到她在抽离。
I can feel her pulling away.

305
00:18:17,908 --> 00:18:20,388
我相信她准备好了就会说的。
I'm sure she'll talk when she's ready.

306
00:18:23,048 --> 00:18:25,408
我今天下午会安排转账。
I'll set up the transfer this afternoon.

307
00:18:26,455 --> 00:18:28,111
不，不，没关系。
No, no, that's all right.

308
00:18:28,135 --> 00:18:30,871
听着，我知道创业有多难。
Listen, I know how hard it is to set up a business.

309
00:18:31,314 --> 00:18:32,834
爱夏。
Love to Rasha.

310
00:18:34,415 --> 00:18:35,951
呃，一切还好吧?
Is, er, everything all right?

311
00:18:35,975 --> 00:18:37,551
你是尼文·格思里吗?
Are you Niven Guthrie?

312
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:38,545
看不见你。
Aye.

313
00:18:38,569 --> 00:18:40,744
我想跟伊芙说几句话。
Yeah, I'd just like to have a quick word with Eve.

314
00:18:40,769 --> 00:18:42,345
你觉得她怎么样?
How does she seem to you?

315
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:45,071
就像刚刚失去丈夫的人。
Like somebody who just lost her husband.

316
00:18:45,404 --> 00:18:46,671
看不见你。
Aye.

317
00:18:46,695 --> 00:18:48,764
她需要分散一下注意力
Well, she needs a distraction.

318
00:18:49,575 --> 00:18:51,191
能让她转移注意力的东西。
Something to take her mind off things.

319
00:18:51,215 --> 00:18:53,564
所以我觉得她应该退出竞选。
That's why I think she should be back out campaigning.

320
00:18:54,735 --> 00:18:57,511
你似乎对这次竞选很有影响力。
You seem to be throwing a lot of weight behind this campaign.

321
00:18:57,884 --> 00:18:59,111
我只是想帮忙。
I'm just helping out.

322
00:18:59,884 --> 00:19:02,484
是啊，不止这些。你资助她。
Aye, it's more than that. You're funding her.

323
00:19:04,735 --> 00:19:06,844
我对伊芙很有信心。
Look, I have a lot of faith in Eve.

324
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:09,615
你知道，我觉得她可以帮助这些岛屿。
And, you know, I think she can help the islands.

325
00:19:11,015 --> 00:19:13,231
你有什么好处?
And what's in it for you?

326
00:19:13,587 --> 00:19:15,507
改变世界的机会?
The chance to make a difference?

327
00:19:27,695 --> 00:19:31,751
大多数潜水员都很痛苦。认为他们比我们强。
Most divers are a pain. Think they're better than us.

328
00:19:31,775 --> 00:19:33,215
但不是冠军宝座。
But not Eamon.

329
00:19:34,455 --> 00:19:37,311
他是个好人。好开心。
He was a nice guy. Good laugh.

330
00:19:37,804 --> 00:19:39,431
你最后一次和他说话是什么时候?
When did you last talk to him?

331
00:19:39,455 --> 00:19:42,791
他刚到这里来吃早饭，就进了房间。
He came in here for breakfast just before he went into the chamber.

332
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:44,951
你没看到他在房间里吗?
You didn't see him in the chamber?

333
00:19:45,444 --> 00:19:49,911
拉森说厨房的工作人员可以进入卫星控制中心。
Er, Larson said that the galley staff have access to Sat Control.

334
00:19:49,935 --> 00:19:51,997
我通常在6点左右吃晚饭，
I normally take up the evening meal at about six,

335
00:19:52,035 --> 00:19:53,991
但米克昨晚来取了
but Mick came and picked it up last night.

336
00:19:54,015 --> 00:19:55,991
-米克·缪尔?——啊。
- Mick Muir? - Aye.

337
00:19:56,015 --> 00:19:57,631
他昨晚怎么样?
How was he last night?

338
00:19:58,432 --> 00:19:59,699
看起来很好。
Seemed fine.

339
00:19:59,724 --> 00:20:01,831
他把自己锁在船舱里了。
He's locked himself in his cabin.

340
00:20:01,855 --> 00:20:03,855
这可能是件好事。
Well, that might be a good thing.

341
00:20:05,735 --> 00:20:09,615
谣传是米克造成了埃蒙的事故。
The rumour is Mick caused Eamon's accident.

342
00:20:47,888 --> 00:20:49,528
你已经失去控制了，是吗?
Gone analogue, have you?

343
00:20:52,004 --> 00:20:54,551
警察拿走了我的电脑。
Well, the police took my desktop away.

344
00:20:55,044 --> 00:20:56,484
是的，我们还在查。
Yeah, we're still going through it.

345
00:20:57,535 --> 00:21:00,671
你知道这次泄密可能是内鬼干的吧?
You do realise this leak of yours was probably an inside job?

346
00:21:00,946 --> 00:21:03,591
真的吗?你知道些什么吗?
Really? You know something about it?

347
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:07,895
我只是说，就算我也没蠢到黑进警察的电脑。
I'm just saying, even I'm not stupid enough to hack a police computer.

348
00:21:14,735 --> 00:21:15,991
废话吗?
Tosh?

349
00:21:16,015 --> 00:21:17,751
米克·缪尔被袭击了。
Mick Muir's been attacked.

350
00:21:17,775 --> 00:21:20,671
他在去勒威克综合医院的路上。
He's on his way to Lerwick General.

351
00:21:20,695 --> 00:21:22,151
发生了什么事?
What happened?

352
00:21:22,175 --> 00:21:24,324
他在自己的船舱里被袭击了。
He was assaulted in his cabin.

353
00:21:32,975 --> 00:21:34,944
胡说。他在做什么?
Tosh. How's he doing?

354
00:21:34,975 --> 00:21:37,911
他要做手术了。他手臂上有几处骨折。
He's going into surgery. He's got a couple of fractures in his arm.

355
00:21:37,935 --> 00:21:40,295
-他说谁袭击他了吗?-他说他没看见。
- Did he say who attacked him? - He says he didn't see them.

356
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:42,671
原谅我。DI佩雷斯。设得兰群岛警察。
Excuse me. DI Perez. Shetland Police.

357
00:21:42,695 --> 00:21:44,231
哦,基督。我告诉你。
Oh, Christ. I told you.

358
00:21:44,255 --> 00:21:46,271
我被伏击。我没看见是谁干的。
I was ambushed. I didn't see who did it.

359
00:21:46,295 --> 00:21:47,711
但你知道他们为什么这么做。
But you know why they did it.

360
00:21:47,735 --> 00:21:50,471
我和埃蒙的死一点关系都没有。我做了我的工作，仅此而已。
I had nothing to do with Eamon's death. I did my job, that's all.

361
00:21:50,495 --> 00:21:51,751
你的队友不同意。
Your crewmates disagree.

362
00:21:52,222 --> 00:21:53,982
我被陷害了。
I'm being set up.

363
00:21:59,164 --> 00:22:00,551
你觉得呢?
What do you think?

364
00:22:00,575 --> 00:22:02,151
我不知道。
I don't know.

365
00:22:02,724 --> 00:22:05,064
我可以收买他，因为他玩忽职守。
I can buy him causing it through negligence.

366
00:22:05,088 --> 00:22:08,551
但我不能让他那样杀高迪。
But I can't see him killing Gauldie like that.

367
00:22:09,034 --> 00:22:10,775
我看不出动机。
And I can't see a motive.

368
00:22:13,215 --> 00:22:15,311
也许我们只是还没找到而已。
Maybe we just haven't found it yet.

369
00:22:15,943 --> 00:22:19,111
我们得把缪尔和加尔布雷斯联系起来。
We have to link Muir to Galbraith.

370
00:22:19,496 --> 00:22:23,031
所以找出他们之间的联系。他住在哪里?
So find out what connects them. Where does he live?

371
00:22:23,055 --> 00:22:24,751
他在布雷有一处漏气了。
He's got a flat in Brae.

372
00:22:25,449 --> 00:22:28,055
我去和基恩谈谈看看能不能拿到搜查令。
I'll speak to Kean and see if we can get a search warrant.

373
00:22:32,234 --> 00:22:33,884
唐尼有东西给我们。
Donnie's got something for us.

374
00:22:34,975 --> 00:22:36,911
我翻了弗雷泽的桌面。
I went through Fraser's desktop.

375
00:22:36,935 --> 00:22:40,511
上面有些奇怪的东西。谁看尸检视频是为了好玩?
Some right weird stuff on it. Who watches autopsy videos for fun?

376
00:22:40,535 --> 00:22:41,831
唐尼吗?
Donnie?

377
00:22:41,855 --> 00:22:43,871
哦,对不起。不管怎么说,呃,
Oh, sorry. Anyway, er,

378
00:22:44,191 --> 00:22:46,311
弗雷泽没有黑进你的数据库。
Fraser didn't hack into your database.

379
00:22:46,335 --> 00:22:48,991
事实上，据我所知，没有人这么做。
In fact, as far as I can see, nobody did.

380
00:22:49,015 --> 00:22:50,711
你是说内鬼?
You mean an inside job?

381
00:22:50,735 --> 00:22:52,711
这就是我的想法，是的。
That would be my thinking, aye.

382
00:22:52,735 --> 00:22:55,991
我们能确定是谁在内部下载的吗?
So can we identify who downloaded these internally?

383
00:22:56,015 --> 00:22:57,431
他们没有下载。
They weren't downloaded.

384
00:22:57,455 --> 00:22:59,271
不，我觉得是发给《纪事报》的照片
No, I think the images sent to The Chronicle

385
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:00,751
从原件中扫描出来的
were scanned from the originals.

386
00:23:00,775 --> 00:23:04,231
我是说，作为一种借口，这很粗糙，但很有效。
I mean, as a piece of subterfuge, it's crude, but it's effective.

387
00:23:04,255 --> 00:23:06,575
没有任何数字痕迹。
There's no digital traces whatsoever.

388
00:23:08,364 --> 00:23:09,831
他似乎不太高兴。
He doesn't seem very happy.

389
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:11,415
不要往心里去。
Don't take it personally.

390
00:23:15,655 --> 00:23:16,895
先生!
Sir!

391
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:20,231
我不管唐尼怎么说
I don't care what Donnie says,

392
00:23:20,255 --> 00:23:22,855
我觉得这里没人会向媒体泄密。
I don't believe anyone in here would leak to the press.

393
00:23:24,121 --> 00:23:25,401
不,我没有。
No, me neither.

394
00:23:26,495 --> 00:23:29,591
犯罪现场的原始图像保存在停尸房。
The original crime scene images are stored at the mortuary.

395
00:23:29,844 --> 00:23:31,191
给柯拉打电话，告诉她
Call Cora and tell her

396
00:23:31,215 --> 00:23:33,351
泄密者可能来自她的部门。
the leak might have come from her department.

397
00:23:33,375 --> 00:23:35,671
告诉她我们需要一份所有人的名单
And tell her we're going to need a list of all the people

398
00:23:35,695 --> 00:23:37,535
-谁能看到照片——正确的。
- who've got access to the images. - Right.

399
00:23:39,615 --> 00:23:42,471
高迪家的搜索小组
So, the search team at the Gauldie house

400
00:23:42,495 --> 00:23:45,271
没找到埃蒙无人机的SD卡。
didn't find the SD card for Eamon's drone.

401
00:23:45,295 --> 00:23:48,431
但柯斯蒂表示，他是在休息时间剪辑视频的。
But Kirsty says he edited the videos on his breaks.

402
00:23:48,724 --> 00:23:51,271
他觉得他可能带着它去上班了。
Thinks he might have taken it to his work with him.

403
00:23:51,295 --> 00:23:52,991
所以情报管理局可能有。
So the ISA might have it.

404
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:55,151
我晚点可以去他们的实验室。
I could head over to their lab later on.

405
00:23:55,175 --> 00:23:58,311
好的。好。琳达·莫顿有什么消息?
OK. Good. What's the word on Lynda Morton?

406
00:23:58,335 --> 00:24:00,751
她公寓外有辆巡逻车。
Er, we got a patrol car outside her flat.

407
00:24:00,775 --> 00:24:04,791
她大约两点钟回家。一个人。没有访客的迹象。
She came home about two. Alone. No sign of any visitors.

408
00:24:05,001 --> 00:24:08,321
好的。我要你今晚过去，看看谁会出现。
OK. I want you over there tonight, and see who turns up.

409
00:24:10,124 --> 00:24:11,831
我得出去一个小时。
I've got to go out for an hour.

410
00:24:11,855 --> 00:24:13,471
好的。一切都好吗?
OK. Is everything all right?

411
00:24:13,761 --> 00:24:16,001
是的。我要找的人。
Yeah. Someone I need to talk to.

412
00:24:37,975 --> 00:24:39,551
今天早些时候,
Earlier today,

413
00:24:40,052 --> 00:24:42,471
我问你知不知道你爸爸在哪里
When I asked if you knew where your Dad was

414
00:24:42,495 --> 00:24:44,244
他死的前一天
the day before he died,

415
00:24:44,768 --> 00:24:49,484
我觉得你知道的比你说的要多。
I got the feeling that you knew more than you were letting on.

416
00:24:54,335 --> 00:24:56,255
我知道你和你爸爸关系很好。
I know that you and your Dad were close.

417
00:24:57,935 --> 00:25:00,615
我知道你想保护他。
And I know that you want to protect him.

418
00:25:02,215 --> 00:25:03,815
我不知道他在哪里。好吗?
I don't know where he was. OK?

419
00:25:09,588 --> 00:25:11,828
你觉得他在哪里?
Where do you think he was?

420
00:25:13,735 --> 00:25:15,575
可能和她在一起。
Probably with her.

421
00:25:17,455 --> 00:25:19,711
会是谁呢?
And who would that be?

422
00:25:20,088 --> 00:25:21,328
菌群。
Flora.

423
00:25:22,175 --> 00:25:23,591
植物M。
Flora M.

424
00:25:23,615 --> 00:25:24,758
植物M ?
Flora M?

425
00:25:24,787 --> 00:25:27,551
那是她打电话时他手机上出现的名字。
That was the name that came up on his phone when she rang.

426
00:25:27,575 --> 00:25:30,391
你怎么知道她和你爸爸是…?
And how do you know that she and your Dad were...?

427
00:25:30,415 --> 00:25:32,231
我注意到的东西。
I noticed things.

428
00:25:32,764 --> 00:25:34,204
我妈妈没有的东西。
Things my mum didn't.

429
00:25:36,008 --> 00:25:38,744
她一打电话，他就鬼鬼祟祟的。
When she called, he'd get all secretive.

430
00:25:39,139 --> 00:25:41,284
他会去另一个房间和她说话。
He'd go off into another room to talk to her.

431
00:25:42,655 --> 00:25:46,631
之后，他的脸上总是带着内疚的表情。
And afterwards, he'd always have this guilty look on his face.

432
00:25:46,655 --> 00:25:49,095
这个弗洛拉·M在他死的前一天打过电话吗?
Did this Flora M call the day before he died?

433
00:25:50,388 --> 00:25:51,908
当我们要去学校的时候。
As we were leaving for school.

434
00:25:52,855 --> 00:25:54,175
你确定是她吗
And you're sure it was her?

435
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:57,334
它是她的。
It was her.

436
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:04,271
我们还在查加尔布雷斯的联系人。
We're still going through Galbraith's contacts.

437
00:26:04,295 --> 00:26:07,031
但到目前为止，我们还没有遇到弗洛拉。
But so far, we haven't come across a Flora.

438
00:26:07,055 --> 00:26:09,911
如果他有外遇，他很可能会隐瞒得很好。
If he was having an affair, he'd probably have kept it well-hidden.

439
00:26:09,935 --> 00:26:12,151
是啊，尤其是伊芙要竞选议员。
Yeah, especially with Eve running to be an MP.

440
00:26:12,175 --> 00:26:13,671
他需要格外小心。
He'd need to be extra careful.

441
00:26:14,164 --> 00:26:16,991
比利，再查一遍加尔布雷斯的通话记录
Billy, go through Galbraith's phone records again

442
00:26:17,015 --> 00:26:20,351
看看能不能找到莫兰提到的那通电话
and see if you can find the call that Merran mentioned.

443
00:26:20,375 --> 00:26:21,711
有人回复你了吗
Did anybody get back to you

444
00:26:21,735 --> 00:26:24,111
对洛根·克雷根的调查
on the IHAT investigation into Logan Creggan?

445
00:26:24,135 --> 00:26:27,871
克雷根和他的部队被指控在伊拉克虐囚。
It seems Creggan and his unit were accused of prisoner abuse in Iraq.

446
00:26:27,895 --> 00:26:30,511
很多情况下。这是一起死亡事件。
Lots of cases. One that involved a fatality.

447
00:26:30,535 --> 00:26:32,671
那么为什么指控被撤销了呢?
So why were the charges dropped?

448
00:26:32,695 --> 00:26:33,951
他们没有。
They weren't.

449
00:26:33,975 --> 00:26:36,871
但政府在2017年停止了IHAT。
But the government pulled the plug on IHAT in 2017.

450
00:26:41,288 --> 00:26:42,528
你还好吗?
Are you OK?

451
00:26:44,855 --> 00:26:46,951
我的律师中枪了，
I've got a lawyer who was shot,

452
00:26:46,975 --> 00:26:51,591
我有个目击证人被以最可怕的方式杀害了。
I've got a witness who was killed in the most horrific way imaginable.

453
00:26:51,615 --> 00:26:54,271
我有多个嫌疑人和作案动机
I've got multiple suspects and motives,

454
00:26:54,295 --> 00:26:57,071
我没有任何线索能将他们联系起来
and I've got nothing to connect any of them.

455
00:26:57,095 --> 00:26:58,631
最重要的是，
And to top it all off,

456
00:26:58,655 --> 00:27:01,591
有人把犯罪现场照片泄露给了媒体。
I've got somebody leaking crime scene photos to the press.

457
00:27:01,615 --> 00:27:03,935
所以，不，不是真的。
So no, not really.

458
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:06,855
我个人的意思。
I meant personally.

459
00:27:07,975 --> 00:27:09,511
我知道。
I know.

460
00:27:09,874 --> 00:27:12,954
谢谢你的关心，但从这方面来说，我没事。
And thanks for asking, but on that front, I'm fine.

461
00:27:14,543 --> 00:27:16,183
记住你这几天过得很艰难。
Just remember you've had a tough few days.

462
00:27:16,207 --> 00:27:17,527
你需要放松。
You need to take it easy.

463
00:27:19,375 --> 00:27:22,271
我不能,胡说。我要去出诊了
I can't, Tosh. I've got a house call to make

464
00:27:22,295 --> 00:27:24,591
我的另一个问题-
to the other problem I've got -

465
00:27:24,975 --> 00:27:26,575
多娜小锚。
Donna Killick.

466
00:27:39,695 --> 00:27:43,135
嗨。我是迪佩雷斯。设得兰群岛警察。
Hi. I'm DI Perez. Shetland Police.

467
00:27:44,375 --> 00:27:46,055
对不起。进来。
Sorry. Come in.

468
00:27:52,488 --> 00:27:53,768
一次又一次。
And again.

469
00:28:07,255 --> 00:28:09,015
来欢迎我回家?
Here to welcome me home?

470
00:28:10,695 --> 00:28:12,711
我只是来看看你安顿好了没有
I'm just here to see if you've settled in

471
00:28:12,735 --> 00:28:14,775
如果你还需要什么。
and if there's anything else you need.

472
00:28:15,975 --> 00:28:17,375
你还能再活十年?
You got another ten years?

473
00:28:21,302 --> 00:28:23,782
我想你听说了亚历克斯·加尔布雷斯的事。
I take it you heard about Alex Galbraith.

474
00:28:24,855 --> 00:28:27,671
我们不知道他的死和你的审判有没有关系
We don't know if his death had anything to do with your trial,

475
00:28:27,695 --> 00:28:32,015
或者释放你，但这是可能的。
or your release, but it is possible.

476
00:28:33,035 --> 00:28:34,931
你为什么要告诉我?
And why are you telling me?

477
00:28:35,095 --> 00:28:37,991
如果他被杀是因为救了你出狱，
Well, if he was killed because he got you out of prison,

478
00:28:38,208 --> 00:28:41,688
我以为你会觉得自己有责任。
I thought you might feel some kind of responsibility.

479
00:28:42,615 --> 00:28:44,815
我觉得我有很多责任。
I feel responsible for a lot of things.

480
00:28:46,161 --> 00:28:47,521
但不是他的死
But not his death.

481
00:28:49,015 --> 00:28:52,335
我不喜欢你试图让我觉得我应该。
And I don't appreciate you trying to make me feel that I should.

482
00:28:54,055 --> 00:28:55,991
亚历克斯是个好人。
Alex was a good man.

483
00:28:56,015 --> 00:28:58,124
这是一件可怕的事情。
It was an awful thing to happen.

484
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:02,471
达伦·贝德福德。勒威克综合医院的顾问。
Darren Bedford. Consultant at Lerwick General.

485
00:29:02,804 --> 00:29:04,031
贝德福德?
Bedford?

486
00:29:04,055 --> 00:29:07,671
我的妻子，菲奥娜。她是亚历克斯的私人助理。
Ah, my wife, Fiona. She was Alex's PA.

487
00:29:07,695 --> 00:29:11,511
我知道艾丽克丝为了救你付出了多少努力，唐娜。
So I knew how hard Alex worked to secure your release, Donna.

488
00:29:11,844 --> 00:29:14,831
他所做的一切不仅是为了别人，也是为了自己。
He did what he did as much for himself as anyone else.

489
00:29:15,155 --> 00:29:18,275
他太喜欢拍自己的背了。
He liked to pat himself on the back just a bit too much.

490
00:29:20,921 --> 00:29:22,401
有点像我们的吉米。
A bit like our Jimmy.

491
00:29:24,941 --> 00:29:26,781
明天再见。
I'll see you again tomorrow.

492
00:29:40,234 --> 00:29:41,684
你知道的…
You know...

493
00:29:42,415 --> 00:29:44,031
一会儿,
for a minute,

494
00:29:44,055 --> 00:29:47,164
我还以为你是来道歉的。
I thought you might be here to apologise.

495
00:29:47,655 --> 00:29:49,235
为什么道歉?
To apologise for what?

496
00:29:49,268 --> 00:29:51,884
在我的审判中撒谎。
Lying at my trial.

497
00:29:52,935 --> 00:29:56,071
也许说谎有点残酷
Well, maybe lying's a bit harsh,

498
00:29:56,095 --> 00:29:59,511
但你肯定没说实话。
but you definitely didn't tell the truth.

499
00:30:00,004 --> 00:30:01,631
不是全部的真相。
Not the whole truth.

500
00:30:02,284 --> 00:30:06,871
你告诉他们是我杀了那个女孩，但是…
I mean, you told them I killed that girl, but...

501
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:09,511
你没告诉他们我丈夫的事。
you didn't tell them about my husband.

502
00:30:09,535 --> 00:30:11,151
我怀孕了。
That I was pregnant.

503
00:30:11,175 --> 00:30:13,551
我只是想保护我未出生的孩子。
That I was just trying to protect my unborn child.

504
00:30:13,575 --> 00:30:15,255
我不是去保护你的
I wasn't there to defend you.

505
00:30:17,895 --> 00:30:20,735
那个女孩的名字叫莉齐·基尔缪尔。
And the girl's name was Lizzie Kilmuir.

506
00:30:25,175 --> 00:30:26,791
一切都好吗?
Everything OK?

507
00:30:27,067 --> 00:30:28,324
看不见你。
Aye.

508
00:30:30,334 --> 00:30:32,014
我正要走。
I was just leaving.

509
00:30:45,684 --> 00:30:48,271
呃,抱歉。你……
Er, sorry. You...

510
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:50,795
你不记得我了，是吗?
You don't remember me, do you?

511
00:30:51,855 --> 00:30:55,071
圣诞节。肯定是2001 ?
Christmas. Must've been 2001?

512
00:30:55,095 --> 00:31:00,111
你和你的醉鬼朋友在我在丹尼斯顿的公寓过夜。
You and your drunken pal spent the night in my flat in Dennistoun.

513
00:31:00,524 --> 00:31:02,631
不，我觉得那不是我。
No, I don't think that was me.

514
00:31:02,655 --> 00:31:08,415
“伯恩斯是完美的诗人，《大白鲨》是完美的电影。”
"Burns is the perfect poet and Jaws the perfect movie."

515
00:31:09,495 --> 00:31:12,391
好的。也许那就是我。
OK. So maybe that was me.

516
00:31:12,415 --> 00:31:14,591
你的醉友是马克·帕丁森。
Your drunken pal was Mark Pattison.

517
00:31:14,615 --> 00:31:17,991
你当警察的时候，你和他在皮特街工作。
You and he worked out of Pitt Street when you were in uniform.

518
00:31:18,604 --> 00:31:21,791
马克是我的兄弟。我是他的小妹妹。
Mark's my brother. I'm his wee sister.

519
00:31:22,201 --> 00:31:24,681
正确的。马克·帕蒂森。
Right. Mark Pattison.

520
00:31:25,724 --> 00:31:27,551
梅格,你。
And you're Meg.

521
00:31:27,924 --> 00:31:29,951
看不见你。Dennistoun。是的，我现在想起来了。
Aye. Dennistoun. Yeah, I remember now.

522
00:31:29,975 --> 00:31:32,151
-不，不，你不能。——我……
- No, no, you don't. - I'm...

523
00:31:32,175 --> 00:31:33,631
好的,别担心。
OK, don't worry.

524
00:31:34,189 --> 00:31:37,151
你喝醉了。有趣,但是喝醉了。
You were pretty drunk. Fun, but drunk.

525
00:31:37,175 --> 00:31:40,311
好吧，我只能相信你的话了。
Well, I'm going to have to take your word for it.

526
00:31:40,764 --> 00:31:41,975
呃，你是护士吗?
Er, and you're nursing?

527
00:31:41,999 --> 00:31:45,831
啊哈。专门从事临终关怀。
Uh-huh. Specialising in end-of-life care.

528
00:31:46,444 --> 00:31:47,951
那一定很艰难。
That must be tough.

529
00:31:48,315 --> 00:31:49,835
奖励。
Rewarding, too.

530
00:31:52,164 --> 00:31:54,084
你知道唐娜的过去吗
Are you aware of Donna's history?

531
00:31:54,764 --> 00:31:56,871
我不是来做判断的。
I'm not here to make judgments.

532
00:31:57,284 --> 00:32:00,151
正确的。好吧，有人会的。
Right. Well, there are people who will.

533
00:32:00,644 --> 00:32:02,071
呃…
Er...

534
00:32:02,884 --> 00:32:05,351
如果你遇到什么麻烦，给我打电话。
if you get any trouble, then give me a call.

535
00:32:05,375 --> 00:32:06,935
我的号码在背面。
My number's on the back.

536
00:32:08,821 --> 00:32:10,957
顺便说一句，你是对的。
Oh, and you were right, by the way.

537
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:13,642
这是一部完美的电影。
It is the perfect movie.

538
00:32:22,564 --> 00:32:24,151
你是说SD卡?
An SD card, you say?

539
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:27,791
是的。我们认为戴高迪可能把它带在了潜水室里。
Yeah. We think Gauldie might have had it with him in the dive chamber.

540
00:32:27,815 --> 00:32:30,311
他们刚把他的东西送来了。
Well, they've just brought his belongings in.

541
00:32:30,335 --> 00:32:33,096
它们还在盒子里。我们还没来得及看一遍呢。
They're still in boxes. We've not had a chance to go through them yet.

542
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,782
-我很乐意帮忙。-不，你很好
- I'm happy to help. - No, you're all right.

543
00:32:36,155 --> 00:32:37,395
我们将管理。
We'll manage.

544
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:40,471
-但这可能需要一些时间。-没问题。
- But it could take some time. - That's no problem.

545
00:32:40,495 --> 00:32:42,295
我就在这里等着。
I'll just wait over here.

546
00:32:53,108 --> 00:32:56,108
凯特。凯特，我知道这很难。
Kate. Kate, I know it's hard.

547
00:32:57,015 --> 00:33:00,111
唐娜也不会待太久的，所以…
Look, Donna's not going to be around for long anyway, so...

548
00:33:00,135 --> 00:33:02,449
你无缘无故地让自己心烦。
you're getting yourself upset for no reason.

549
00:33:02,473 --> 00:33:03,591
没有理由吗?
No reason?

550
00:33:03,804 --> 00:33:06,511
她杀了我妹妹。这是一个很大的原因。
She killed my sister. That's a big reason.

551
00:33:06,535 --> 00:33:08,151
我不是那个意思。
I didn't mean it like that.

552
00:33:08,175 --> 00:33:11,015
你当然有理由生气。
Of course you have every right to be angry.

553
00:33:12,095 --> 00:33:14,015
愤怒还不足以掩盖它。
Angry doesn't even begin to cover it.

554
00:33:15,175 --> 00:33:16,631
我知道。
I know.

555
00:33:16,861 --> 00:33:18,797
我很抱歉发生了这样的事。
And I'm sorry this has happened.

556
00:33:19,555 --> 00:33:21,244
你不配。
You don't deserve it.

557
00:33:23,881 --> 00:33:26,041
听着，我得走了。
Look, I've got to go.

558
00:34:18,228 --> 00:34:19,668
大便。
Shit.

559
00:36:04,581 --> 00:36:05,661
吉米?
Jimmy?

560
00:36:09,301 --> 00:36:10,741
你没事吧，爸爸?
You all right, Dad?

561
00:36:12,935 --> 00:36:17,135
哦……一定是睡着了。
Oh... Must have fallen asleep.

562
00:36:21,255 --> 00:36:23,015
今天的事我很抱歉。
I'm sorry about today.

563
00:36:24,775 --> 00:36:26,311
今天好吗?
Today?

564
00:36:26,335 --> 00:36:29,164
关于在斯卡洛威餐厅吃午饭时的混乱。
About the mix-up over lunch at The Scalloway.

565
00:36:30,575 --> 00:36:34,391
-但邓肯带我去吃午饭了。-是的，我知道
- But Duncan took me to lunch. - Yes, I know that.

566
00:36:34,415 --> 00:36:37,004
但之前，你以为我要…
But before, you thought that I was going to...

567
00:36:40,444 --> 00:36:42,444
你和邓肯去哪了?
Where did you and Duncan go?

568
00:36:43,295 --> 00:36:48,271
哦，在城里的某个地方。你妈妈会喜欢的。
Oh, somewhere in the town. Your mum would've liked it.

569
00:36:48,295 --> 00:36:49,764
是,是。
Aye, aye.

570
00:36:50,515 --> 00:36:51,955
噢,那是大。
Oh, that's grand.

571
00:36:56,495 --> 00:36:59,271
-谢谢你照顾他。-哦，没问题。
- Thanks for looking after him. - Oh, no problem.

572
00:36:59,295 --> 00:37:00,684
他状态很好。
He was on fine form.

573
00:37:06,615 --> 00:37:08,375
你看起来需要喝一杯。
You look like you need a drink.

574
00:37:10,374 --> 00:37:12,174
唐娜。
Donna's back.

575
00:37:16,015 --> 00:37:17,751
你见过她吗?
You seen her?

576
00:37:18,015 --> 00:37:19,975
她刚才在楼上的家里。
She's up at her house just now.

577
00:37:21,084 --> 00:37:23,164
看起来她从没离开过。
Looks like she's never been away.

578
00:37:24,128 --> 00:37:26,888
凯特和她的朋友们肯定会接受的。
Well, that'll go down well with Kate and her pals.

579
00:37:33,724 --> 00:37:35,271
比利?
Billy?

580
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:38,204
弗洛拉不是人。这是一个地方。
Flora M isn't a person. It's a place.

581
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:41,278
弗洛拉·马里斯宗教静修所。
The Flora Maris religious retreat.

582
00:37:41,682 --> 00:37:44,351
在沃尔塞结束了。他们和船主交谈。
It's over on Whalsay. They spoke to the ferry master.

583
00:37:44,375 --> 00:37:47,764
他证实了加尔布雷斯死前一天在那里。
Who confirmed that Galbraith was over there the day before he died.

584
00:37:48,695 --> 00:37:51,431
加尔布雷斯来宗教静修做什么?
What the hell's Galbraith doing at a religious retreat?

585
00:37:51,455 --> 00:37:53,151
我不知道。
I have no idea.

586
00:37:53,175 --> 00:37:55,711
但船长说这是他的常规行程。
But the ferry master said it was a regular trip for him.

587
00:37:56,621 --> 00:37:58,221
好的。
OK.

588
00:38:28,735 --> 00:38:29,844
嗨。
Hi.

589
00:38:30,401 --> 00:38:32,577
我是吉米·佩雷斯探长。
I'm Detective Inspector Jimmy Perez.

590
00:38:32,602 --> 00:38:35,882
我是来调查亚历克斯·加尔布雷斯的谋杀案的。和我……
I'm here investigating the murder of Alex Galbraith. And I'd...

591
00:38:59,084 --> 00:39:01,124
哦,来吧!
Oh, come on!

592
00:39:01,804 --> 00:39:05,964
-你什么时候回家的?-几个小时前
- When did you get home? - Couple of hours ago.

593
00:39:06,804 --> 00:39:10,455
我打不开这些该死的文件。
Urgh, I can't open these bloody files.

594
00:39:12,135 --> 00:39:13,791
什么文件?
What files?

595
00:39:13,815 --> 00:39:16,111
我昨晚拿到了埃蒙·高迪的SD卡。
I picked up Eamon Gauldie's SD card last night.

596
00:39:16,135 --> 00:39:19,204
我看到里面有视频文件。但就是打不开。
I can see there are video files on it. But they won't open.

597
00:39:21,114 --> 00:39:22,714
你想让我……吗?
Do you want me to...?

598
00:39:31,168 --> 00:39:33,084
啊,是的。看起来他们腐化了。
Aye, yeah. Looks like they're corrupted.

599
00:39:33,111 --> 00:39:37,511
-那你能修好吗?——也许。
- Well, can you fix them? - Maybe.

600
00:39:37,535 --> 00:39:39,807
我在局里有一些恢复软件。
I've got some recovery software at the station.

601
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:44,751
那你得过去一趟。你一打开就给我打电话。
Then you need to get over there. As soon as you open them, you call me.

602
00:39:45,101 --> 00:39:48,141
-待会儿见。——再见。
- See you later. - See ya.

603
00:39:53,535 --> 00:39:55,215
-唐尼!——我走了。
- Donnie! - I'm going.

604
00:40:47,001 --> 00:40:48,564
你一定是佩雷斯局长。
You must be DI Perez.

605
00:40:50,747 --> 00:40:52,427
我的妹妹卡罗琳。
I'm Sister Carolyn.

606
00:40:53,095 --> 00:40:56,204
宝拉修女说你在调查亚历克斯的死。
Sister Paula said you were looking into Alex's death.

607
00:40:56,295 --> 00:40:57,895
我在调查他的谋杀案。
I'm investigating his murder.

608
00:40:59,695 --> 00:41:01,871
我还是不敢相信发生了这样的事。
Still can't believe it happened.

609
00:41:01,895 --> 00:41:02,935
你知道他吗?
You knew him?

610
00:41:04,095 --> 00:41:07,564
是的,…不。
Yes, and... no.

611
00:41:08,481 --> 00:41:10,001
我们去散步好吗?
Shall we go for a walk?

612
00:41:12,695 --> 00:41:16,431
亚历克斯十个月前开始来这里。
Alex started visiting about ten months ago.

613
00:41:16,804 --> 00:41:19,071
我们把一些土地卖给了路边的农场。
We were selling some land to the farm up the road.

614
00:41:19,095 --> 00:41:21,284
他负责法律方面的事务。
And he was taking care of the legal side.

615
00:41:22,075 --> 00:41:23,915
然后呢，他一直回来吗?
And what, he just kept on coming back?

616
00:41:25,215 --> 00:41:30,231
大多数情况下，他只会出现几个小时。我们喝茶，聊天。
He'd turn up most weeks for a few hours. We'd drink tea, talk.

617
00:41:30,484 --> 00:41:36,484
-有什么特别的事吗?——他的生活。主要是。他的麻烦。
- About anything in particular? - His life. Mostly. His troubles.

618
00:41:37,695 --> 00:41:40,004
所以你是他的心理医生?
What, so, you were his therapist?

619
00:41:40,895 --> 00:41:43,071
我尽量不去评判。
I tried not to judge.

620
00:41:43,095 --> 00:41:44,484
他赞赏。
He appreciated that.

621
00:41:46,255 --> 00:41:48,732
我也不想问你这个，但是，
You know, I hate to have to ask you this, but,

622
00:41:49,724 --> 00:41:52,111
你和他在一起吗?
were you and he together?

623
00:41:52,444 --> 00:41:55,191
-就是睡在一起?-是的。
- As in sleeping together? - Yeah.

624
00:41:55,215 --> 00:41:56,511
上帝,没有。
God, no.

625
00:41:56,535 --> 00:41:58,504
你怎么会这么想?
What on Earth made you think that?

626
00:41:58,529 --> 00:42:01,545
因为他女儿确信他怀了
Well, because his daughter was convinced that he was having

627
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:02,906
外遇。
an affair.

628
00:42:03,175 --> 00:42:07,751
她无意中听到他给你打电话，所以她以为…
And she overheard him on the phone to you, so she assumed that...

629
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:09,524
我是他的姘头吗?
I was his bit on the side?

630
00:42:11,948 --> 00:42:14,626
即使我有资格谈恋爱，
Even if I was in a position to be in a relationship,

631
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:18,764
我不会选择亚历克斯。恶魔太多了。
I wouldn't have chosen Alex. Far too many demons.

632
00:42:21,461 --> 00:42:25,261
不过，如果他的生命中没有另一个女人，我会很惊讶。
Although, I'd be surprised if there wasn't another woman in his life.

633
00:42:32,815 --> 00:42:35,791
别误会我的意思
You know, don't take this the wrong way

634
00:42:35,815 --> 00:42:39,031
但你看起来不太像修女。
but you don't seem much like a nun.

635
00:42:39,055 --> 00:42:40,644
因为我不是。
Cos I'm not.

636
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:44,324
宝拉修女和其他人都是真正的修女。
Sister Paula and the others are real nuns.

637
00:42:44,655 --> 00:42:47,591
我就是他们所谓的生活专业人士。
I'm what they call life professed.

638
00:42:47,615 --> 00:42:51,309
这意味着我祈祷，独处，行善，
It means I do the prayer, the solitude, the good deeds,

639
00:42:52,324 --> 00:42:56,284
但我不参与"嫁给耶稣"那部分
but I sit out on the whole married to Jesus bit.

640
00:43:07,775 --> 00:43:08,895
景色真不错，是吧?
It's quite a view, eh?

641
00:43:09,975 --> 00:43:11,884
是的。我妈妈喜欢这里。
Yeah. My mum loves it up here.

642
00:43:15,381 --> 00:43:16,661
爱。
Loved.

643
00:43:20,535 --> 00:43:22,484
你最近失去她了?
You lost her recently?

644
00:43:27,415 --> 00:43:29,884
——我很抱歉。-不，不用。
- I'm sorry. - No, don't be.

645
00:43:31,674 --> 00:43:33,330
你还好吗?
How are you holding up?

646
00:43:33,355 --> 00:43:36,441
呃，我还没有机会考虑这个问题。
Err, I've not really had a chance to think about it.

647
00:43:36,466 --> 00:43:39,676
我要工作，还要照顾我爸爸。
I've got work and my Dad to look after.

648
00:43:42,674 --> 00:43:44,274
但你必须为她哀悼。
But you have to mourn her.

649
00:43:49,675 --> 00:43:51,315
我想我不想。
I don't think I want to.

650
00:43:53,708 --> 00:43:57,108
我知道悲伤需要很长时间说实话我…
I know how long grief takes, and to be honest, I'm...

651
00:43:59,975 --> 00:44:01,375
你是什么?
You're what?

652
00:44:05,695 --> 00:44:09,215
我开始明白为什么亚历克斯·加尔布雷斯每周都来这里。
I'm beginning to understand why Alex Galbraith came here every week.

653
00:44:13,655 --> 00:44:17,924
所以你在他死的前一天见过他。你觉得他怎么样?
So you saw him the day before he died. How did he seem to you?

654
00:44:19,655 --> 00:44:21,911
一如既往的烦恼。
His usual troubled self.

655
00:44:21,935 --> 00:44:24,775
但不为任何一件特别的事情烦恼?
But not troubled about any one thing in particular?

656
00:44:26,535 --> 00:44:31,604
如果你是问他是否担心会被谋杀?然后,没有。
If you're asking if he was worried about being murdered? Then, no.

657
00:45:14,895 --> 00:45:17,631
加尔布雷斯去看修女了?
Galbraith was seeing a nun?

658
00:45:17,655 --> 00:45:20,671
不。她不是修女。
No. She's not exactly a nun.

659
00:45:20,695 --> 00:45:22,857
但她也不是他的情妇。
But she's not his mistress, either.

660
00:45:22,881 --> 00:45:25,551
尽管她说加尔布雷斯是那种
Although she did suggest that Galbraith was the type to

661
00:45:25,575 --> 00:45:27,071
有另一个女人。
have another woman.

662
00:45:27,095 --> 00:45:30,311
-缪尔的公寓搜查得怎么样了?——没有。
- How goes the search at Muir's flat? - Nothing yet.

663
00:45:30,335 --> 00:45:33,071
但我昨晚找到了SD卡。
But I did find the SD card last night.

664
00:45:33,484 --> 00:45:36,151
唐尼在局里，想打开文件。
Donnie's at the station trying to open the files.

665
00:45:36,484 --> 00:45:39,135
-好的，我现在就去看他。——好的。
- Right, I'll go and see him now. - OK.

666
00:45:46,141 --> 00:45:48,021
这到底是怎么回事?
What the hell's going on here?

667
00:45:50,535 --> 00:45:53,151
-我不知道你和米克住在一起。——我不喜欢。
- I didn't realise you lived with Mick. - I don't.

668
00:45:53,175 --> 00:45:54,751
他让我睡在沙发上
He lets me crash on the couch

669
00:45:54,775 --> 00:45:56,831
当我们在工作之间遇到困难的时候。
when we've got a tight turn around between jobs.

670
00:45:56,855 --> 00:45:58,564
这比住旅馆便宜多了。
It's a lot cheaper than a hotel.

671
00:45:59,564 --> 00:46:01,071
我打电话给医院了
Oh, I called the hospital.

672
00:46:01,095 --> 00:46:02,695
他们说他手术后正在恢复中。
They said he was recovering from surgery.

673
00:46:02,719 --> 00:46:05,111
-嗯-他们给他的手臂复位了
- Mm. - They had to re-set his arm.

674
00:46:05,135 --> 00:46:09,031
——耶稣。可怜的米克。-你知道是谁袭击了他吗?
- Jesus. Poor Mick. - Do you know who assaulted him?

675
00:46:09,055 --> 00:46:13,071
-肯定是船员中的一员-但你不知道是哪一个?
- Had to be one of the crew. - But you don't know which one?

676
00:46:13,095 --> 00:46:16,484
他们知道我和米克是朋友。所以他们最不可能告诉我的人。
They know I'm mates with Mick. So, I'm the last person they'd tell.

677
00:46:16,895 --> 00:46:20,524
提醒你一下，我现在可以很容易地掐死米克。
Mind you, I could easily throttle Mick myself, right now.

678
00:46:21,775 --> 00:46:23,031
为什么?
Why?

679
00:46:23,055 --> 00:46:24,668
哦,来吧。
Oh, come on.

680
00:46:24,692 --> 00:46:27,591
我是说，埃蒙出事一定是他造成的。
I mean, it had to have been him that caused Eamon's accident.

681
00:46:27,615 --> 00:46:30,655
-你确定是意外?-还能是什么呢?
- You're sure it was an accident? - What else could it have been?

682
00:46:33,255 --> 00:46:37,111
如果你睡在这里的沙发上，谁会睡在客房?
So if you sleep on the couch here, who sleeps in the guest room?

683
00:46:37,135 --> 00:46:39,671
这是安琪拉的房间。米克的妹妹。
That's Angela's room. Mick's sister.

684
00:46:39,695 --> 00:46:42,471
她和她的伴侣分手后，在这里住了几个月。
She stayed here for a few months, when she broke up with her partner.

685
00:46:42,495 --> 00:46:43,855
她现在在戈尔斯皮。
She's in Golspie now.

686
00:46:47,215 --> 00:46:49,351
卡上有四个视频文件。
There's four video files on the card.

687
00:46:49,375 --> 00:46:52,345
第一个视频的时间是10点15分。最后一个是11:12。
Time stamp on the first video is 10:15. The last one is 11:12.

688
00:46:52,369 --> 00:46:55,711
-是的，我想看最后一个。-这有点问题。
- Yeah, I want to see the last one. - There's a bit of a problem there.

689
00:46:55,735 --> 00:46:58,511
卡肯定是在潜水事故中损坏的。
See, the card must've got corrupted during the dive accident.

690
00:46:58,535 --> 00:47:00,060
因为文件打不开。
Cos the files won't open.

691
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:01,911
没有一个人吗?
None of them?

692
00:47:01,935 --> 00:47:04,591
我整个早上都在运行恢复软件，但是，
I've been running recovery software all morning but the, err,

693
00:47:04,615 --> 00:47:06,711
这些后来的文件都不见了。
these later files are gone.

694
00:47:06,735 --> 00:47:10,551
我只能找到一段10点45分的录像。
Erm, all I could get was a bit of footage from a video timed 10:45.

695
00:47:10,781 --> 00:47:12,541
但是上面有东西。
But there is something on it.

696
00:47:18,935 --> 00:47:21,844
-那是Alex Galbraith的车——看这个。
- That's Alex Galbraith's car. - Watch this.

697
00:47:30,255 --> 00:47:31,911
这就是我得到的全部信息。
So that's all I've managed to get.

698
00:47:32,372 --> 00:47:34,772
另一辆车的登记信息太模糊了。
It's, it's too blurry to get a registration on the other car.

699
00:47:34,796 --> 00:47:37,895
-但如果我做一些调整，我可以…-我知道这是谁的车。
- But if I do some tweaking, I can... - I know whose car it is.

700
00:47:54,708 --> 00:47:58,524
-对，就是我。那又怎样?-那又怎样? !
- Yeah, that's me. So what? - So what?!

701
00:47:59,724 --> 00:48:02,537
我们有一段录像显示你试图经营亚历克斯·加尔布雷斯的店
So, we've got video footage of you trying to run Alex Galbraith's

702
00:48:02,569 --> 00:48:03,711
汽车驶离马路…
car off the road...

703
00:48:03,735 --> 00:48:05,051
不，我不是想把他赶出马路。
No, I wasn't trying to run him of the road.

704
00:48:05,075 --> 00:48:06,991
是在他被杀前半小时被枪杀的。
It was shot half an hour before he was killed.

705
00:48:07,015 --> 00:48:09,831
所以你就在谋杀现场附近。
So that puts you in the vicinity of the murder scene.

706
00:48:09,855 --> 00:48:11,695
-好吧，我杀了他?——妈妈。
- Oh, so well, I killed him, then?! - Mum.

707
00:48:15,181 --> 00:48:19,277
没关系。我做了一件非常愚蠢的事。
It's OK. I did something really stupid.

708
00:48:19,302 --> 00:48:21,238
我知道。但我很生气。
I know that. But I was angry.

709
00:48:21,263 --> 00:48:24,919
我这几周一直想跟他说话，但一直不理我。
I'd been trying to talk to him for weeks, kept ignoring me.

710
00:48:24,944 --> 00:48:28,524
-所以你撞了他的车?——不!我不是故意的，我…
- So you rammed his car? - No! I wasn't trying to, I...

711
00:48:29,855 --> 00:48:33,375
老实说，我不知道我当时想做什么。我生气了。
Look, honestly, I don't know what I was trying to do. I just saw red.

712
00:48:39,655 --> 00:48:41,271
他为什么不理你?
Why was he ignoring you?

713
00:48:43,055 --> 00:48:44,911
对，因为他不想进入
Right, because he didnae want to get into

714
00:48:44,935 --> 00:48:46,215
关于唐娜·基利克的争论
an argument about Donna Killick?

715
00:48:46,239 --> 00:48:48,463
看看是不是，是不是某个来自南方的律师，
See if it was, if it was some lawyer from down south,

716
00:48:48,487 --> 00:48:50,631
我就明白了。但他是从这里来的。
I would understand. But he was from here.

717
00:48:50,655 --> 00:48:52,991
他知道把她带回来会带来痛苦。
He knew that bringing her back was going to cause pain.

718
00:48:53,015 --> 00:48:54,655
但不管怎样，他还是做到了!
But he did it, anyway!

719
00:48:56,441 --> 00:48:58,937
-之后发生了什么?——什么都没有。
- What happened after this? - Nothing.

720
00:48:59,095 --> 00:49:02,631
我撞了他，吓了一跳，继续开车。
I hit him, I got a fright, I drove on.

721
00:49:02,924 --> 00:49:05,325
-你没有跟踪他去他家?-我回家了。
- You didn't follow him to his house? - I came home.

722
00:49:06,107 --> 00:49:08,173
她回来的时候我就在这里。
And I was here when she got back.

723
00:49:11,775 --> 00:49:14,951
-那是什么时间?(约11。
- What time would that be? - About 11.

724
00:49:15,244 --> 00:49:17,151
差不多和你在一起的时间
So, about the same time that you were with

725
00:49:17,175 --> 00:49:18,655
弗雷泽·克雷根在他家?
Fraser Creggan at his house?

726
00:49:20,335 --> 00:49:22,695
来吧,莫莉。你不能同时出现在两个地方。
Come on, Molly. You cannae be in two places at the one time.

727
00:49:22,719 --> 00:49:25,295
你当时不是和弗雷泽在一起就是在这里。
Now, you were either with Fraser at his house or you were here.

728
00:49:25,319 --> 00:49:26,535
到底是哪一个呢?
Now, which one is it?

729
00:49:31,848 --> 00:49:33,488
我是一个人来的。
I was here on my own.

730
00:49:37,375 --> 00:49:39,231
你认为凯特有能力吗?
Do you think Kate's capable?

731
00:49:39,255 --> 00:49:41,004
六个月前，我会说不。
Six months ago, I'd have said no.

732
00:49:42,255 --> 00:49:45,031
但现在，她看起来很生气。
But now, she just, she seems angry.

733
00:49:45,444 --> 00:49:47,751
她和所有设得兰群岛的人。
Her and everyone else in Shetland.

734
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:49,391
搜查米克·缪尔的公寓。
The search of Mick Muir's flat.

735
00:49:49,415 --> 00:49:52,431
-你找到什么了吗?-他和加尔布雷斯没有任何联系
- You manage to find anything? - Nothing linking him to Galbraith.

736
00:49:52,455 --> 00:49:53,951
或者是戴高乐。
Or Gauldie, for that matter.

737
00:49:53,975 --> 00:49:57,271
但凯莉·麦克安德鲁似乎认为是缪尔害死了高迪。
But Carrie McAndrew seems to think Muir caused Gauldie's death.

738
00:49:57,295 --> 00:49:58,455
对不起。凯莉·麦克安德鲁是谁?
Sorry. Who's Carrie McAndrew?

739
00:49:58,479 --> 00:50:00,862
她在潜水船上管理厨房。
She runs the kitchen on the dive ship.

740
00:50:01,655 --> 00:50:04,711
-她在缪尔家做什么?-她在工作间隙呆在那里。
- What was she doing at Muir's? - She stays there between jobs.

741
00:50:04,735 --> 00:50:06,671
但她不是唯一呆在那里的人。
But she's not the only one who stays there.

742
00:50:06,695 --> 00:50:08,431
他给他妹妹准备了一张床
He's got a bed made up for his sister for

743
00:50:08,455 --> 00:50:09,975
当她从戈尔斯皮回来的时候
when she's home from Golspie.

744
00:50:11,095 --> 00:50:12,495
Golspie吗?
Golspie?

745
00:50:14,321 --> 00:50:16,324
姐姐叫什么名字?
What's the sister's name?

746
00:50:33,188 --> 00:50:34,948
老习惯,是吗?
Old habits, eh?

747
00:50:36,335 --> 00:50:38,791
——什么?——你。
- What? - You.

748
00:50:39,027 --> 00:50:42,067
在白天出现。偷偷摸摸。
Turning up during the day. Sneaking around.

749
00:50:43,341 --> 00:50:44,821
带你回来。
Takes you back.

750
00:50:46,015 --> 00:50:47,471
请注意,
Mind you,

751
00:50:47,495 --> 00:50:50,231
如果你想要的是性，恐怕你会失望的。
if it's sex you're after, I'm afraid you might be disappointed.

752
00:50:50,255 --> 00:50:53,364
-巨蟹座严重破坏性欲。-你为什么回来?
- Cancer plays havoc with the libido. - Why did you come back?

753
00:50:54,095 --> 00:50:56,951
你惹的麻烦。你留下的烂摊子。这已经够糟糕的了。
The trouble you caused. The mess you left. That was bad enough.

754
00:50:56,975 --> 00:50:58,951
-但是回来…-我有选择的
- But to come back... - I had a choice.

755
00:50:58,975 --> 00:51:01,377
我要么死在牢房里，要么死在家里。
I either die in a cell or I die at home.

756
00:51:01,401 --> 00:51:02,911
那其他人呢?
And what about everyone else?

757
00:51:02,935 --> 00:51:04,524
操别人。
Fuck everyone else.

758
00:51:07,495 --> 00:51:09,030
这是一个错误。
This was a mistake.

759
00:51:09,054 --> 00:51:11,791
你也不是那么无辜，邓肯。
Y'know, you're not so innocent, Duncan.

760
00:51:11,815 --> 00:51:15,791
你也需要为“混乱”承担一些责任。
You need to take some responsibility for "the mess" too.

761
00:51:15,815 --> 00:51:17,574
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

762
00:51:17,598 --> 00:51:20,031
我想保护的是你儿子。
It was your son I was trying to protect.

763
00:51:20,055 --> 00:51:23,831
我所做的一切，只是为了保护艾伦的安全。
I only did, what I did, to keep Alan safe.

764
00:51:23,855 --> 00:51:27,471
你知道如果凯文发现了他的事他会怎么做。
And you know what Kevin would've done if he'd found out about him.

765
00:51:27,495 --> 00:51:30,031
你也该受到责备。
You are just as much to blame.

766
00:51:30,055 --> 00:51:33,231
我没有杀了一个女孩然后让一个无辜的人在监狱里腐烂。
I didn't kill a girl and leave an innocent man to rot in prison.

767
00:51:33,255 --> 00:51:35,391
不…不，你只是一如既往。
No... no, you just did what you always did.

768
00:51:35,415 --> 00:51:37,311
表现得像个懦夫!
And played the bloody coward!

769
00:51:45,868 --> 00:51:48,644
我都不知道他在哪儿!
Oh, I don't even know where he is!

770
00:51:49,288 --> 00:51:51,684
艾伦吗?他在格拉斯哥。
Alan? He's in, he's in Glasgow.

771
00:51:54,175 --> 00:51:56,231
-你和他有联系?——呃,没有。
- You're in contact with him? - Er, no.

772
00:51:56,255 --> 00:52:00,111
凯西一直保持联系。老实说，他不想和我说话。
Cassie keeps in touch. To be honest, he doesn't want to talk to me.

773
00:52:00,135 --> 00:52:01,175
我要见他。
I want to see him.

774
00:52:05,775 --> 00:52:07,604
让他来看我，邓肯。
Make him come and see me, Duncan.

775
00:52:07,768 --> 00:52:09,164
我不知道我能不能做到。
I don't know if I can.

776
00:52:12,608 --> 00:52:15,364
在我死之前，我要再见我儿子一面。
I need to see my son again, before I die.

777
00:52:19,547 --> 00:52:21,284
好的。谢谢。
OK. Thanks.

778
00:52:22,375 --> 00:52:25,431
据凯莉说，缪尔的姐姐叫安吉拉。
According to Carrie, Muir's sister's name is Angela.

779
00:52:25,455 --> 00:52:28,431
搬到戈尔斯皮之前，她和伴侣住在设得兰群岛，
Before moving to Golspie, she lived in Shetland with her partner,

780
00:52:28,455 --> 00:52:29,791
和儿子。
and son.

781
00:52:29,815 --> 00:52:32,015
搭档是洛根·克雷根。
Partner was Logan Creggan.

782
00:52:37,935 --> 00:52:39,911
克雷根是缪尔的姐夫?
Creggan is Muir's brother-in-law?

783
00:52:39,935 --> 00:52:42,164
Muir是Fraser的叔叔。
And Muir is Fraser's uncle.

784
00:52:44,895 --> 00:52:48,551
所以洛根·克雷根杀了加尔布雷斯。
So Logan Creggan kills Galbraith.

785
00:52:48,575 --> 00:52:52,871
-埃蒙·高迪看到或拍下了它。-不管怎样，他都是目击者
- Eamon Gauldie sees or films it. - Either way, he's a witness.

786
00:52:52,895 --> 00:52:54,911
克雷根得照顾他。
Creggan has to take care of him.

787
00:52:54,935 --> 00:52:58,951
克雷根打电话给缪尔，安排一场事故，并把它留在家里。
Creggan phones Muir to arrange an accident and keep it in the family.

788
00:52:58,975 --> 00:53:00,575
时机会很紧迫。
The timing would be tight.

789
00:53:02,895 --> 00:53:03,895
不过，这是可以做到的。
Could be done, though.

790
00:53:03,922 --> 00:53:06,151
好的。在这儿等一下。
OK. Hold on a moment here.

791
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:08,591
昨天你还在说贩毒团伙和有组织犯罪。
Yesterday, you were talking about drug gangs and organised crime.

792
00:53:08,615 --> 00:53:10,991
你是说那是一个前士兵和他的姐夫。
Now, you're saying it's an ex-squaddie and his brother-in-law.

793
00:53:11,015 --> 00:53:12,831
不，昨天我们只是在找联系
No, yesterday we were looking for a connection

794
00:53:12,855 --> 00:53:14,655
加尔布雷斯和高迪的谋杀案
between the killings of Galbraith and Gauldie.

795
00:53:14,679 --> 00:53:16,849
射杀加尔布雷斯的人怎么可能
How could the person who shot Galbraith

796
00:53:16,873 --> 00:53:21,751
乘潜水船去找高迪?这就是那种联系。
get to Gauldie on a dive boat? This here is, is that connection.

797
00:53:21,775 --> 00:53:24,671
它们是相互关联的。那又怎样?
They're related to each other. So what?

798
00:53:25,044 --> 00:53:29,364
这并不意味着有阴谋。你需要更多的证据。
It doesn't mean there's a conspiracy. You need more proof.

799
00:53:43,848 --> 00:53:45,448
你爸爸在吗?
Is your Dad around?

800
00:53:48,495 --> 00:53:51,804
-我得跟你谈谈，洛根。——所以,说话。
- Need to talk to you, Logan. - So, talk.

801
00:54:03,735 --> 00:54:06,044
能告诉我这是怎么回事吗?
You want to tell me what this is about?

802
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:07,404
米克·穆尔。
Mick Muir.

803
00:54:08,608 --> 00:54:09,704
关于他的什么?
What about him?

804
00:54:09,729 --> 00:54:13,404
-你最后一次和他说话是什么时候?——我不知道。六个月前，也许吧。
- When did you last speak to him? - Dunno. Six months ago, maybe.

805
00:54:13,615 --> 00:54:16,404
你确定最近没跟他联系过吗?
Are you sure you haven't been in contact with him more recently?

806
00:54:16,815 --> 00:54:19,591
缪尔的电话记录显示他给这栋房子打了两次电话，
Muir's phone records show that he phoned this house twice,

807
00:54:19,615 --> 00:54:21,951
埃蒙·高迪死的那晚
the night that Eamon Gauldie died.

808
00:54:21,975 --> 00:54:23,391
埃蒙·高迪到底是谁?
Who the hell is Eamon Gauldie?

809
00:54:23,415 --> 00:54:27,431
他是个潜水员，死在你姐夫的眼皮底下。
He's a diver who died on your brother-in-law's watch.

810
00:54:27,455 --> 00:54:30,351
就是那个在加尔布雷斯家附近驾驶无人机的人，
Same guy who was flying a camera drone near Galbraith's house,

811
00:54:30,375 --> 00:54:32,004
当他中枪的时候。
when HE was shot.

812
00:54:33,135 --> 00:54:35,191
这些都是很有趣的东西
Well, this is all fascinating stuff -

813
00:54:35,724 --> 00:54:37,631
这跟我有什么关系?
what's it got to do with me?

814
00:54:37,655 --> 00:54:40,414
如果埃蒙·高迪是加尔布雷斯谋杀案的目击者，
If Eamon Gauldie was a witness to Galbraith's murder,

815
00:54:40,438 --> 00:54:43,031
那他就成问题了。
then that would make him a problem.

816
00:54:43,055 --> 00:54:45,511
凶手必须除掉他。
The murderer would have to get rid of him.

817
00:54:45,535 --> 00:54:49,271
除了，埃蒙·高迪在海上。所以没办法接近他。
Except, Eamon Gauldie's at sea. So there's no way of getting to him.

818
00:54:49,295 --> 00:54:51,191
除非他认识船上的人。
Unless he knows somebody on that ship.

819
00:54:51,215 --> 00:54:53,295
现在，你明白我的意思了吗?
Now, do you see where I'm going with this?

820
00:54:55,075 --> 00:54:56,395
耶稣。
Jesus.

821
00:54:57,295 --> 00:54:59,671
你们真的快淹死了，嗯…
You lot are really drowning, eh...

822
00:54:59,695 --> 00:55:04,231
我不知道这个高迪是谁但如果我真想让人杀了他，
I don't know who this Gauldie is but if I did want somebody to kill him,

823
00:55:04,255 --> 00:55:07,564
我肯定不会去问米克·缪尔。他是个白痴。
I sure as shit wouldn't ask Mick Muir. The man's an idiot.

824
00:55:07,888 --> 00:55:12,284
为什么亚历克斯·加尔布雷斯拒绝在IHAT案中为你辩护?
Why did Alex Galbraith refuse to represent you in the IHAT case?

825
00:55:14,335 --> 00:55:19,951
-我告诉过你。我不知道。-也许他认为你有罪。
- I told you. I don't know. - Maybe he, he thought you were guilty.

826
00:55:19,975 --> 00:55:22,431
他怎么想并不重要。
Well, it doesn't matter what he thought.

827
00:55:22,455 --> 00:55:24,311
他仍然有责任保护我。
He still had a duty to defend me.

828
00:55:24,335 --> 00:55:26,231
也许有一些案例
Maybe there were some cases that

829
00:55:26,255 --> 00:55:28,615
就连亚历克斯·加尔布雷斯也无法忍受。
even Alex Galbraith couldn't stomach.

830
00:55:30,095 --> 00:55:32,591
也许想到那些可怜的囚犯，你
Maybe the thought of those poor prisoners that you

831
00:55:32,615 --> 00:55:36,375
你的朋友们把他打得屁滚滚打，把他赶走了。
and your pals beat the shit out of, repulsed him.

832
00:55:39,415 --> 00:55:41,255
我想你现在最好离开。
I think you'd better leave, now.

833
00:55:44,014 --> 00:55:45,134
好的。
OK.

834
00:55:56,655 --> 00:55:58,044
胡说。
Tosh.

835
00:55:58,615 --> 00:56:00,106
再给SPA打电话。
Call the SPA again.

836
00:56:00,131 --> 00:56:02,731
我想知道更多关于这个死去的囚犯的事。
I wannae find out more about this prisoner who died.

837
00:56:32,927 --> 00:56:35,604
我和水疗中心的联系人谈过了。
I spoke to my contact at the SPA.

838
00:56:36,415 --> 00:56:40,071
克雷根被指控杀害的囚犯不是士兵。
The prisoner Creggan was accused of killing wasn't a soldier.

839
00:56:40,095 --> 00:56:43,604
是个平民。一个十几岁的男孩。
It was a civilian. A teenage boy.

840
00:56:44,695 --> 00:56:48,511
显然，克雷根的人抓住了他，把他带到山里去了。
Apparently, Creggan's unit captured him and took him into the hills.

841
00:56:48,941 --> 00:56:51,181
他们把他打死了
And they beat him to death.

842
00:57:13,175 --> 00:57:16,157
我一直在找你。现在…
I've been looking for you. Now...

843
00:57:16,183 --> 00:57:17,804
你的朋友在哪里?
where is your friend?

844
00:57:18,655 --> 00:57:20,071
我不明白你的意思。
I don't know what you mean.

845
00:57:25,975 --> 00:57:28,535
快点。让他妈的。
Hurry up. Get fucking in.
