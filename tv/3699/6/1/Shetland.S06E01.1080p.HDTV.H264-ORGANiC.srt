1
00:00:38,514 --> 00:00:42,194
又有声音从天上说，你要写上
And the voice from heaven saying, "Write this:"

2
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:49,810
"从今以后，在主里而死的人有福了!"
"Blessed are the dead, who, from now on, die in the Lord!"

3
00:00:49,834 --> 00:00:52,450
“是的，”幽灵说，
"Yes," says the spirit,

4
00:00:52,474 --> 00:00:54,914
“他们将停止劳作而休息。”
"they will rest from their labours."

5
00:01:00,594 --> 00:01:01,994
吉米?
Jimmy?

6
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:10,474
当伟大的灵魂死去，
And when great souls die,

7
00:01:11,554 --> 00:01:17,514
一段时间后，和平之花盛开，缓慢而总是不规则。
after a period, peace blooms, slowly and always irregularly.

8
00:01:19,554 --> 00:01:24,754
空间充满了一种舒缓的电子振动。
Spaces fill with a kind of soothing electric vibration.

9
00:01:26,274 --> 00:01:32,594
我们的感觉，恢复了，再也不一样了，低声对我们说。
Our senses, restored, never to be the same, whisper to us.

10
00:01:34,034 --> 00:01:35,674
他们的存在。
They existed.

11
00:01:36,954 --> 00:01:38,354
他们的存在。
They existed.

12
00:01:41,114 --> 00:01:45,274
我们可以。越来越好。
We can be. Be and be better.

13
00:01:46,634 --> 00:01:48,194
因为他们的存在。
For they existed.

14
00:01:54,154 --> 00:01:59,034
你把我们的妹妹玛丽托付给了上帝。
You have entrusted our sister Mary to God's merciful keeping.

15
00:02:00,594 --> 00:02:03,610
我们现在把她的尸体埋在地上，
We now commit her body to the ground,

16
00:02:03,634 --> 00:02:05,130
地球地球,
earth to earth,

17
00:02:05,154 --> 00:02:07,210
遥遥无期
ashes to ashes,

18
00:02:07,234 --> 00:02:08,954
尘归于尘,土归于土。
dust to dust.

19
00:02:38,474 --> 00:02:41,010
你认为还要多久?
How much longer do you think it will take?

20
00:02:41,034 --> 00:02:44,250
别担心。我今天下午去追他们要文件。
Don't worry. I'll chase them for the paperwork this afternoon.

21
00:02:44,274 --> 00:02:46,952
你的留任是毫无疑问的。
Your leave to remain is not in doubt.

22
00:02:53,114 --> 00:02:57,170
根据"弱势群体"计划，你可以在这里住五年，
Under the Vulnerable Persons scheme, you have a five-year stay,

23
00:02:57,194 --> 00:02:59,090
至少。听天由命。
at least. Inshallah.

24
00:02:59,114 --> 00:03:02,370
这只是内政部的恶作剧而已。有趣的爆菊?
It's just the Home Office playing funny buggers. Funny buggers?

25
00:03:02,394 --> 00:03:04,832
他的意思是他们只是有点尴尬。
He means they're just being awkward.

26
00:03:06,514 --> 00:03:09,170
我妈妈想知道之后会发生什么。
My mother would like to know what happens after that.

27
00:03:09,194 --> 00:03:12,330
我们得把它固定下来，但交给我吧。
Well, we need to make it permanent, but leave that with me.

28
00:03:12,354 --> 00:03:14,330
我已经全部搞定了。
I've got that all in hand.

29
00:03:14,354 --> 00:03:16,034
所以不再有搞笑的家伙了?
So no more funny buggers?

30
00:03:17,194 --> 00:03:19,810
这是正确的!我说过了，没什么好担心的。
That's right! Now, as I said, nothing to worry about.

31
00:03:19,834 --> 00:03:22,954
很快我们会讨论。Galbraith先生，谢谢你。不客气。
We'll talk soon. Mr Galbraith, thank you. Not at all.

32
00:03:26,594 --> 00:03:28,370
嗨。嘿。
Hi. Hey.

33
00:03:28,394 --> 00:03:31,810
提醒你一下，你要去接梅伦。我知道，我知道!
Just reminding you that you're picking up Merran. I know, I know!

34
00:03:31,834 --> 00:03:34,410
对不起。我知道。我知道你有很多事要做。
Sorry. I know. I know you've got a lot on.

35
00:03:34,434 --> 00:03:37,570
我也想亲自去，但我不能错过这次战略会议
I would do it myself, but I cannot miss this strategy meeting

36
00:03:37,594 --> 00:03:39,490
奈文。它很好。别担心。
with Niven. It's fine. Don't worry.

37
00:03:39,514 --> 00:03:41,650
听着，你不能让尼文久等。
Listen, you can't keep Niven waiting.

38
00:03:41,674 --> 00:03:44,232
还有别的吗?
Is there anything else?

39
00:03:45,714 --> 00:03:47,114
哦,狗屎。
Oh, shit.

40
00:03:48,554 --> 00:03:52,650
办公室外面有一群"阻止释放"的暴徒。
Oh, I've got a "stop the release" mob outside the office.

41
00:03:52,674 --> 00:03:54,234
我再打给你。
I'll call you back.

42
00:04:03,594 --> 00:04:05,130
哦，亚历克斯，说句话。
Oh, Alex, a quick word.

43
00:04:05,154 --> 00:04:08,090
我在写一篇关于唐娜·基利克的同情释放
I'm doing a piece on how Donna Killick's compassionate release

44
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:09,850
可能会影响受害者的家人
might affect her victim's family.

45
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:11,450
我和Kate Kilmuir谈过了
I've spoken to Kate Kilmuir,

46
00:04:11,474 --> 00:04:13,610
我只是需要一些细节。
I just need some details.

47
00:04:13,634 --> 00:04:16,330
唐娜的肺癌已经到了第四阶段。这是终端。
Donna has stage four lung cancer. It's terminal.

48
00:04:16,354 --> 00:04:18,434
她一开始就不该进监狱。
She shouldn't have been in prison in the first place.

49
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:21,130
她是家暴的受害者，当时精神不正常
She was the victim of domestic abuse and wasn't in her right mind

50
00:04:21,154 --> 00:04:23,970
在谋杀发生的时候都记下来了吗?
at the time of the murder. You got all that?

51
00:04:23,994 --> 00:04:26,034
好。爱你的家人。
Good. Love to the family.

52
00:04:28,834 --> 00:04:32,090
嗨。克莱德HMP要和你谈谈。
Hi. HMP Clyde need to talk to you.

53
00:04:32,114 --> 00:04:33,930
好的。
OK.

54
00:04:33,954 --> 00:04:36,770
这是什么?它看起来像什么?
What's this? What's it look like?

55
00:04:36,794 --> 00:04:41,530
这是一条羊腿。我猜这是吉姆·克劳福德的说法
It's a leg of lamb. I suspect it's Jim Crawford's way of saying

56
00:04:41,554 --> 00:04:43,594
他不能再付账单了。
he can't pay his bill again.

57
00:04:44,594 --> 00:04:47,330
你去看看加文要不要?他看起来好像会做
Will you see if Gavin wants it? He looks as if he could do

58
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:48,930
一个提要。
with a feed.

59
00:04:48,954 --> 00:04:51,970
听着，打完电话后我得回家一段时间，好吗?
Listen, I need to pop home for a bit after this call, OK?

60
00:04:51,994 --> 00:04:53,434
好的。
OK.

61
00:05:25,834 --> 00:05:28,834
吉米，我很抱歉。
Jimmy, I'm so sorry.

62
00:05:30,074 --> 00:05:34,074
你母亲是个很好的女人，被带走得太快了。
Your mother was a wonderful woman, taken far too soon.

63
00:05:36,194 --> 00:05:37,810
,别担心。
And don't worry.

64
00:05:37,834 --> 00:05:40,034
我们都会盯着你爸爸的。
We'll all keep an eye on your dad.

65
00:05:42,234 --> 00:05:43,554
谢谢。
Thanks.

66
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:49,730
你好吗?
How are you doing?

67
00:05:49,754 --> 00:05:51,210
是的,我很好。
Yeah, I'm OK.

68
00:05:51,234 --> 00:05:54,090
你好吗?是的,我很好。
How are you? Yeah, I'm OK.

69
00:05:54,114 --> 00:05:55,810
爷爷似乎挺过来了。
Grandad seems to be coping.

70
00:05:55,834 --> 00:05:57,570
嗯嗯。
Mm-hm.

71
00:05:57,594 --> 00:05:59,034
他就在这里。卡西!
There he is. Cassie!

72
00:06:00,394 --> 00:06:02,234
我有东西给你。
I've something for you.

73
00:06:07,074 --> 00:06:10,330
今天早上还在这里。
Uh, it was here this morning.

74
00:06:10,354 --> 00:06:12,330
哦……
Oh...

75
00:06:12,354 --> 00:06:15,530
她一定是把它移走了。
She must have moved it.

76
00:06:15,554 --> 00:06:18,154
谁,爸爸?你的母亲。
Who, Dad? Your mother.

77
00:06:19,154 --> 00:06:22,370
她总是该死地搬东西。哦……
She was always bloody moving things. Oh...

78
00:06:22,394 --> 00:06:23,594
我们开始吧。
Here we go.

79
00:06:25,754 --> 00:06:27,954
这是你曾祖母的。
It belonged to your great-granny.

80
00:06:29,634 --> 00:06:31,954
玛丽想把它给你。
Mary wanted you to have it.

81
00:06:34,274 --> 00:06:35,754
谢谢你！
Thank you.

82
00:06:38,474 --> 00:06:41,594
我们得谈谈，亚历克斯。不是现在,好吗?不是现在。
We need to talk, Alex. Not now, OK? Not now.

83
00:06:45,994 --> 00:06:50,170
他们昨天去了阿伯丁-凯尔和我的孩子们。
They left for Aberdeen yesterday - Kyle and my kids.

84
00:06:50,194 --> 00:06:52,490
你一定为自己感到非常自豪。
You must feel very proud of yourself.

85
00:06:52,514 --> 00:06:55,210
我没带走你的孩子，琳达。法院。
I never took your kids, Linda. The courts did.

86
00:06:55,234 --> 00:06:56,770
对此我很抱歉。
And I'm sorry about that.

87
00:06:56,794 --> 00:06:59,154
这不是任何人想要的结局。
This isn't how anyone wanted it to end.

88
00:07:00,394 --> 00:07:02,450
我爱我的孩子们。是啊，但你爱过
I loved my kids. Aye, but you loved

89
00:07:02,474 --> 00:07:05,234
毒品多了一点，不是吗?
the drugs a wee bit more, didn't you?

90
00:07:06,274 --> 00:07:09,730
对不起，我不该那么说的。听着,琳达,
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that. Listen, Linda,

91
00:07:09,754 --> 00:07:12,250
你不能照顾他们，而你丈夫可以。
you couldn't look after them and your husband could.

92
00:07:12,274 --> 00:07:16,170
如果情况有变，我会帮你把他们赢回来，这
Now, if that changes, I will help you to win them back, and that's

93
00:07:16,194 --> 00:07:19,250
一个承诺。但你的孩子是第一位的。
a promise. But your kids had to come first.

94
00:07:19,274 --> 00:07:20,514
好吗?
OK?

95
00:08:05,714 --> 00:08:08,714
耶稣!
Jesus!

96
00:08:18,034 --> 00:08:20,152
耶稣基督!
Jesus Christ!

97
00:08:25,474 --> 00:08:27,034
哇!
Whoa!

98
00:08:54,314 --> 00:08:55,970
亲爱的，我在路上了。
Hi, darling, I'm on my way.

99
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:58,250
你应该来接我的，记得吗?
You were supposed to pick me up, remember?

100
00:08:58,274 --> 00:09:00,690
我知道，我只是在家拿些文件。
I know, I know, I'm just at home picking up a few files.

101
00:09:00,714 --> 00:09:02,930
我十分钟后到，我保证。
I'll be there in ten minutes, I promise.

102
00:09:02,954 --> 00:09:04,970
考试考得怎么样?
How did the exam go anyway?

103
00:09:04,994 --> 00:09:07,592
说了几句废话，但我想我逃过一劫了。
Hit a few bum notes, but I think I got away with it.

104
00:09:09,194 --> 00:09:11,130
我打赌你顺利通过了。
I bet you sailed through it.

105
00:09:11,154 --> 00:09:13,610
你很快就能在阿尔伯特音乐厅演出了。
You'll be playing the Albert Hall in no time.

106
00:09:13,634 --> 00:09:16,170
就是那扇门，给我两分钟，好吗?
That's the door - give me two minutes, OK?

107
00:09:16,194 --> 00:09:18,352
没事的，爸爸，我可以从这里走回来。
It's OK, Dad, I can always walk back from here.

108
00:09:21,074 --> 00:09:22,792
爸爸?
Dad?

109
00:09:25,394 --> 00:09:26,712
爸爸!
Dad!

110
00:09:28,674 --> 00:09:30,594
你还好吗?
Are you OK?

111
00:09:32,274 --> 00:09:34,434
说点什么,爸爸!
Say something, Dad!

112
00:09:52,074 --> 00:09:55,554
正确的。这是……这是他们离开。
Right. That's... that's them away.

113
00:09:59,634 --> 00:10:02,394
我不知道没有她我该怎么办。
I don't know what I'm going to do without her.

114
00:10:08,034 --> 00:10:10,410
爸爸，你为什么不过来和我一起住呢
Look, Dad, why don't you just come and stay with me

115
00:10:10,434 --> 00:10:12,034
几个星期?
for a couple of weeks?

116
00:10:13,554 --> 00:10:15,450
我不想大惊小怪。
I don't want any fuss.

117
00:10:15,474 --> 00:10:17,034
这没什么大惊小怪的。
It's no' a fuss.

118
00:10:18,714 --> 00:10:20,354
你是个好孩子。
You're a good lad.

119
00:10:22,034 --> 00:10:24,354
你知道这是什么感觉。
You know what this feels like.

120
00:10:25,714 --> 00:10:27,714
不是每个人都一样。
Not everyone does.

121
00:10:37,114 --> 00:10:39,570
胡说，这最好是好事。
Tosh, this better be good.

122
00:10:39,594 --> 00:10:41,850
很抱歉给你打电话，但我们刚听说
I'm really sorry to call, but we've just heard

123
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:44,890
亚历克斯·加尔布雷斯被枪杀了
that Alex Galbraith has been shot dead.

124
00:10:44,914 --> 00:10:47,834
我正在去现场的路上，但我觉得你应该知道。
I'm on my way to the scene now, but I thought you should know.

125
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:52,874
正确的,我将……
Right, I'll...

126
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:55,554
我坐下一班飞机过去。
I'll be on the next flight over.

127
00:11:03,514 --> 00:11:06,650
他跟我上次见到他时不一样了。
He's different since the last time I saw him.

128
00:11:06,674 --> 00:11:08,034
是的，是的，他是。
Aye, yeah, he is.

129
00:11:09,754 --> 00:11:12,730
从满屋子的便利贴来看，我觉得
And judging by the Post-it notes all over the house, I think

130
00:11:12,754 --> 00:11:15,050
他这样可能有一段时间了。
he's probably been like that for a wee while.

131
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:19,074
别担心，我一会儿带他过来。
Look, don't worry, I'll bring him over later.

132
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:22,754
好的。你是最好的。
OK. You're the best.

133
00:11:39,554 --> 00:11:40,994
再见,爸爸。
Bye, Dad.

134
00:11:58,594 --> 00:12:01,930
嘿,桑迪。没过多久消息就传开了。
Hey, Sandy. Didn't take long for word to spread.

135
00:12:01,954 --> 00:12:03,410
所以我明白了。
So I see.

136
00:12:03,434 --> 00:12:06,274
好吧，我们把他们赶走，好吗?没有问题。
OK, let's get rid of them, shall we? No problem.

137
00:12:14,874 --> 00:12:17,890
对不起，我拖了。我不知道该怎么办。
I'm sorry to haul. I wasn't sure what to do.

138
00:12:17,914 --> 00:12:20,450
这真的很难接受。
This is just so hard to take in.

139
00:12:20,474 --> 00:12:21,730
没关系。
It's OK.

140
00:12:21,754 --> 00:12:24,130
你做得对。
You did the right thing.

141
00:12:24,154 --> 00:12:26,290
因此,证人。一个也没有。
So, witnesses. None.

142
00:12:26,314 --> 00:12:28,570
当时他的女儿梅兰正在打电话给他。
His daughter Merran was on the phone to him at the time.

143
00:12:28,594 --> 00:12:30,890
她都听到了。
She heard the whole thing.

144
00:12:30,914 --> 00:12:33,730
让我们挨家挨户地回勒威克。
Let's organise a door-to-door all the way back to Lerwick.

145
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:35,994
一定有人看见有人来来往往。
Somebody must have seen someone come and go.

146
00:12:46,554 --> 00:12:47,994
伊芙，我很抱歉。
Eve, I'm so sorry.

147
00:12:51,074 --> 00:12:53,674
我能和莫兰说句话吗?
Do you mind if I have a quick word with Merran?

148
00:12:56,074 --> 00:12:59,394
你能告诉我你和你爸爸打电话时听到了什么吗?
Can you tell me what you heard when you were on the phone with your dad?

149
00:13:01,874 --> 00:13:05,690
他说他去拿一些文件。
He said he was picking up some files.

150
00:13:05,714 --> 00:13:10,314
他和门口的人说话了吗?不。
And did he speak with the person at the door? No.

151
00:13:11,474 --> 00:13:15,914
门铃发出嗡嗡声……三次……然后……
The doorbell buzzed... three times... Then...

152
00:13:17,314 --> 00:13:18,754
两个镜头。
two shots.

153
00:13:30,514 --> 00:13:34,130
保证你不会让我妈妈出事。
Promise you won't let anything happen to my mum.

154
00:13:34,154 --> 00:13:35,754
她会好的。
She'll be OK.

155
00:13:38,554 --> 00:13:42,370
Merran。把他们放在霍尔丹酒店的一个房间里
Merran. Put them in a room in the Haldane Hotel and put

156
00:13:42,394 --> 00:13:45,170
一名安保人员守在门口，直到我们确定
a protection officer on the door, just until we can establish

157
00:13:45,194 --> 00:13:47,050
艾丽克丝绝对是目标
that Alex was definitely the target.

158
00:13:47,074 --> 00:13:48,274
会做的事情。
Will do.

159
00:13:49,834 --> 00:13:52,530
胸部有两处枪伤，一处直接击中心脏。
Two pistol wounds to the chest, one straight to the heart.

160
00:13:52,554 --> 00:13:55,050
他几乎立刻就死了。
He died almost instantly.

161
00:13:55,074 --> 00:13:58,530
它具有职业暗杀的特征。
It has the hallmarks of a professional assassination.

162
00:13:58,554 --> 00:14:03,490
但从枪伤来看，他似乎是在转身。
But from the bullet entry wounds, he seemed to be turning away.

163
00:14:03,514 --> 00:14:06,650
那可能是让一个人进来，就好像他认识他们一样，
That could be to let a person in, as if he knew them,

164
00:14:06,674 --> 00:14:08,770
或者为了保护自己。
or to protect himself.

165
00:14:08,794 --> 00:14:10,394
很难说。
Hard to say.

166
00:14:23,314 --> 00:14:24,754
进来。
Come in.

167
00:14:31,114 --> 00:14:34,850
我只是想看看你需要的东西都准备好了没有。
I just wanted to see if you had everything you needed.

168
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,850
我们很好,谢谢。
We're fine, thanks.

169
00:14:36,874 --> 00:14:39,930
外面有媒体。
There's some press outside.

170
00:14:39,954 --> 00:14:42,730
他们会对你的竞选有疑问，但最好
They'll have questions about your campaign, but best

171
00:14:42,754 --> 00:14:45,610
避开他们，直到我们弄清楚情况
to avoid them until we've got a clearer picture

172
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:47,010
发生了什么。
of what actually happened.

173
00:14:47,034 --> 00:14:48,634
我明白了。
I understand.

174
00:14:53,074 --> 00:14:55,394
梅兰，你在这里很安全。
Merran, you're safe here.

175
00:14:56,514 --> 00:14:57,994
你妈妈也是。
So is your mum.

176
00:14:59,634 --> 00:15:01,354
我不想让你担心，好吗?
I don't want you to worry, OK?

177
00:15:02,794 --> 00:15:04,154
我看不出来。
I don't see how.

178
00:15:06,474 --> 00:15:09,074
一切都不会再和以前一样了。
Nothing's ever going to be the same again.

179
00:15:11,274 --> 00:15:14,850
这将是一个漫长的道路，以任何感觉甚至
It's going to be a long road back to anything that feels even

180
00:15:14,874 --> 00:15:17,690
接近正常水平。
close to normal.

181
00:15:17,714 --> 00:15:21,114
但现在，你们俩都需要时间哀悼。
But now, you both need to take time to grieve.

182
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:13,770
我知道…
I know...

183
00:16:13,794 --> 00:16:16,410
所有人都震惊了。
that this is a shock for everybody.

184
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:20,010
我们都认识亚历克斯，但我希望你集中注意力。
We all knew Alex, but I want you to keep focused.

185
00:16:20,034 --> 00:16:22,650
袭击者仍逍遥法外。
The assailant is still at large.

186
00:16:22,674 --> 00:16:24,850
我们有目击证人。
We do have a witness.

187
00:16:24,874 --> 00:16:27,170
那个女儿，她听到了枪声。
The daughter, she heard the gunshots.

188
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:30,370
不幸的是，她只记得这些。
Unfortunately, that's all that she can remember.

189
00:16:30,394 --> 00:16:33,690
桑迪，我想让你整理一下时间线
Sandy, I would like you to put together a timeline

190
00:16:33,714 --> 00:16:35,450
他的动作。
of his movements.

191
00:16:35,474 --> 00:16:39,490
我们知道他回来拿了一些文件。
Now, we know that he came home to pick up some files.

192
00:16:39,514 --> 00:16:42,330
他总是在白天回家吗?
Did he always come home during the day?

193
00:16:42,354 --> 00:16:46,010
托什，加尔布雷斯家发生了一起入室抢劫案一对夫妇
Tosh, there was that break-in at the Galbraith place a couple

194
00:16:46,034 --> 00:16:48,610
星期前。我想知道到底什么东西被拿走了。
of weeks ago. I want to know exactly what was taken.

195
00:16:48,634 --> 00:16:49,730
确定。
Sure.

196
00:16:49,754 --> 00:16:52,210
检查他的财务状况，专业的和私人的，
Check his finances - professional and private,

197
00:16:52,234 --> 00:16:53,730
查一下他的通话记录
check his phone records,

198
00:16:53,754 --> 00:16:55,474
看看他的社交媒体。
and check his social media.

199
00:16:57,354 --> 00:17:01,610
他的妻子很有可能成为我们的下一任议员，
There's a very good chance that his wife is going to be our next MP,

200
00:17:01,634 --> 00:17:05,330
这意味着我们会得到很多媒体的关注。
and that means that we're going to get a lot of press interest.

201
00:17:05,354 --> 00:17:07,114
但我希望你能忽略它。
But I would like you to ignore it.

202
00:17:08,354 --> 00:17:10,330
没有人说话。
Talk to nobody.

203
00:17:10,354 --> 00:17:13,690
记住，要知道一个人是怎么死的，
Remember - to know how a man died,

204
00:17:13,714 --> 00:17:16,634
你必须先了解他是怎样生活的。
you must first learn how he lived.

205
00:17:21,234 --> 00:17:23,330
请注意安全。
And please stay safe.

206
00:17:23,354 --> 00:17:26,234
不管是谁干的，他都非常危险。
Whoever did this is extremely dangerous.

207
00:17:27,874 --> 00:17:31,330
老板，你十分钟后就能拿到新的财务报表了。是的。
Boss, you've got the new fiscal in ten minutes. Yes.

208
00:17:31,354 --> 00:17:32,874
谢谢你,比利。
Thanks, Billy.

209
00:17:43,234 --> 00:17:45,890
会的，会的。再见。
Will do, will do. Bye.

210
00:17:45,914 --> 00:17:48,050
佩雷兹警官，抱歉，我迟到了。
DI Perez, sorry, I'm late.

211
00:17:48,074 --> 00:17:51,850
玛吉基恩。我将在财政休假期间接手。
Maggie Kean. I'll be taking over while the fiscal's on leave.

212
00:17:51,874 --> 00:17:54,850
我只是想自我介绍一下，了解一下情况
I just want to introduce myself and get the lie of the land

213
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:56,930
关于加尔布雷斯枪击案
regarding the Galbraith shooting.

214
00:17:56,954 --> 00:17:58,650
新闻里好像都是我们。
It seems we're all over the news.

215
00:17:58,674 --> 00:18:01,850
是啊，你真是挑了个好时机开始新工作。
Yeah, you certainly picked a great week to start a new job.

216
00:18:01,874 --> 00:18:03,730
看来你认识加尔布雷斯先生。
I take it you knew Mr Galbraith.

217
00:18:03,754 --> 00:18:06,234
我做了，20多年了。
I did - for over 20 years.

218
00:18:07,354 --> 00:18:09,730
他是个好律师。
He was a good lawyer.

219
00:18:09,754 --> 00:18:12,970
他很受欢迎，岛上几乎所有人都来了
And he's well liked, you know, almost everybody in the isles came

220
00:18:12,994 --> 00:18:14,450
在某个时刻越过他。
across him at some point.

221
00:18:14,474 --> 00:18:17,930
还有伊芙·加尔布雷斯，她正在参加补缺选举，对吗?
And Eve Galbraith, as she's running in the by-election, is that right?

222
00:18:17,954 --> 00:18:19,290
她是,是的。
She is, yeah.

223
00:18:19,314 --> 00:18:22,730
她还得到了一位强有力的
She's also got the backing of a powerful

224
00:18:22,754 --> 00:18:25,370
当地商人尼文·格思里
local businessman, Niven Guthrie.

225
00:18:25,394 --> 00:18:28,730
有他的支持，她很可能胜券在握。
And with his clout behind her, she's probably a shoo-in.

226
00:18:28,754 --> 00:18:30,570
她有可能是目标吗?
Is it possible she was a target?

227
00:18:30,594 --> 00:18:33,170
据当地报纸报道，她树敌不少
According to your local paper, she's made a few enemies

228
00:18:33,194 --> 00:18:34,570
她反对石油的立场。
with her anti-oil stance.

229
00:18:34,594 --> 00:18:35,890
这是真的。
That's true.

230
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:37,514
所以我不排除这种可能性。
So I'm not ruling it out.

231
00:18:39,274 --> 00:18:41,850
但枪手似乎知道他们在做什么。
But it seems like the shooter knew what they were doing.

232
00:18:41,874 --> 00:18:44,090
“好像”。
"Seems like".

233
00:18:44,114 --> 00:18:46,330
好吧，我想媒体会有自己的地盘的
OK, well, I imagine the press are going to have a field

234
00:18:46,354 --> 00:18:47,690
一天。
day with this.

235
00:18:47,714 --> 00:18:49,210
你准备好了吗?
Are you ready for that?

236
00:18:49,234 --> 00:18:50,530
我知道你痛失亲人。
I know you had a bereavement.

237
00:18:50,554 --> 00:18:52,690
葬礼在今天早上举行。
The funeral was this morning.

238
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:55,570
这对你来说一定很难。如果你需要休息，
This must be very difficult for you. If you need some time off,

239
00:18:55,594 --> 00:18:58,570
我肯定我们能带来一些……不,我很好。
I'm sure we can bring in some... No, I'm fine.

240
00:18:58,594 --> 00:19:00,074
有消息随时通知我。
Well, keep me posted.

241
00:19:01,674 --> 00:19:03,114
好的。
OK.

242
00:19:06,754 --> 00:19:11,290
嗨，凯西，我只是想知道行李收拾得怎么样了，
Hi, Cassie, I'm just wondering how the packing is coming along,

243
00:19:11,314 --> 00:19:15,194
如果你收到留言后能给我个小电话，好吗?再见。
so if you could give me a wee phone when you get this, all right? Bye.

244
00:19:17,274 --> 00:19:21,290
霏欧纳贝德福德?我是迪佩雷斯。
Fiona Bedford? I'm DI Perez.

245
00:19:21,314 --> 00:19:23,090
我能说句话吗?
Can I have a word?

246
00:19:23,114 --> 00:19:24,554
好的。
OK.

247
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:29,850
你和亚历克斯密切合作，有没有人生气
You worked closely with Alex, was there anyone who was angry

248
00:19:29,874 --> 00:19:32,434
是跟他还是跟记仇的人?
with him or somebody with a grudge?

249
00:19:34,794 --> 00:19:37,290
总有人对你怀恨在心。
There was always somebody with a grudge.

250
00:19:37,314 --> 00:19:41,170
最近有没有什么案子比其他案子更让他伤心的?
Well, any recent cases that were giving him more grief than others?

251
00:19:41,194 --> 00:19:44,130
显然是唐娜·基利克的获释。
Donna Killick's release, obviously.

252
00:19:44,154 --> 00:19:47,010
在家庭法方面…
On the family-law side...

253
00:19:47,034 --> 00:19:51,314
有一场监护权之争。妻子因为吸毒失去了孩子。
there was a custody battle. Wife lost her kids due to drug addiction.

254
00:19:52,914 --> 00:19:54,690
琳达莫顿。
Lynda Morton.

255
00:19:54,714 --> 00:19:56,514
她一直在刁难他。
She's been giving him a hard time.

256
00:19:58,474 --> 00:20:00,194
她有暴力倾向?
She capable of violence?

257
00:20:06,274 --> 00:20:07,674
你还好吗?
You OK?

258
00:20:10,954 --> 00:20:12,394
我只是…
I just...

259
00:20:13,834 --> 00:20:15,474
我不知道该怎么处理这件事。
I don't know how to process this.

260
00:20:19,634 --> 00:20:21,034
不。
No.

261
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:23,834
这并不容易。
It's not easy.

262
00:20:27,074 --> 00:20:30,010
我需要你帮我做一件事。
There's one thing I need you to do for me.

263
00:20:30,034 --> 00:20:33,890
我需要他过去两年所有案子的档案，我需要
I need the files on all his cases for the last two years, and I need

264
00:20:33,914 --> 00:20:36,514
进入他的电脑和手机。
access to his computers and his phone.

265
00:20:37,754 --> 00:20:39,274
好的。
OK.

266
00:20:51,794 --> 00:20:54,090
你已经在这里很久了。
You've been in here for ages.

267
00:20:54,114 --> 00:20:57,234
茶越来越冷。把无人机收起来。
Tea's getting cold. Just putting the drone away.

268
00:20:59,874 --> 00:21:02,530
你真的要这么潜下去吗?
Do you really have to take this dive?

269
00:21:02,554 --> 00:21:04,570
你说你要休息一下的。
You said you were going to take a break.

270
00:21:04,594 --> 00:21:06,850
我们欠的太多了。你知道的。
We owe too much. You know that.

271
00:21:06,874 --> 00:21:10,010
不管怎样，我可以屏住呼吸……的年龄。
Anyway, I can hold my breath... For ages.

272
00:21:10,034 --> 00:21:11,674
我知道，这不好笑，埃蒙。
I know, it's not funny, Eamon.

273
00:21:12,994 --> 00:21:14,650
我不会一直这样做的，亲爱的。
I won't be doing it forever, darling.

274
00:21:14,674 --> 00:21:16,634
我有B计划。
Got a plan B.

275
00:21:31,154 --> 00:21:34,954
你知道那是什么吗，吉米?那是颗幽灵子弹。
You know what that is, Jimmy? That is a ghost bullet.

276
00:21:36,314 --> 00:21:39,210
好吧，这意味着我们要找的是老式枪吗?
Right, does that mean that we're looking for a vintage gun?

277
00:21:39,234 --> 00:21:45,330
我猜是1944年的德国瓦尔特P38。标准问题,
My best guess is a German 1944 Walther P38. Standard issue,

278
00:21:45,354 --> 00:21:49,010
但不太可能出现在任何登记册上。有一个负载
but unlikely to show up on any registers. There's a load

279
00:21:49,034 --> 00:21:51,050
在战争中四处游荡。
of these knocking around from the war.

280
00:21:51,074 --> 00:21:54,570
但你拿不到弹药，所以这些子弹是定制的。
But you can't get the ammo, so these bullets were custom made.

281
00:21:54,594 --> 00:21:58,130
如果你知道的话，你可以在网上买到这种自制子弹
You can buy home-made bullets like this online, if you know

282
00:21:58,154 --> 00:21:59,850
去哪里看。
where to look.

283
00:21:59,874 --> 00:22:04,610
托什，联系桑迪。让他们检查枪械俱乐部的成员，
Tosh, get a hold of Sandy. Tell to check gun club members,

284
00:22:04,634 --> 00:22:08,330
收藏家。看看有没有人有瓦尔特P38
collectors. See if any of them have got a Walther P38

285
00:22:08,354 --> 00:22:10,170
或者自己制造弹药。
or make their own ammo.

286
00:22:10,194 --> 00:22:12,410
现在可能已经在海里了。
It's probably in the sea by now.

287
00:22:12,434 --> 00:22:14,954
好吧，迁就我。好的。
Aye, well, humour me. OK.

288
00:22:19,314 --> 00:22:22,250
网上有更多关于亚历克斯·加尔布雷斯被枪杀的消息。
There's more online about Alex Galbraith being shot.

289
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:24,490
我还是不敢相信。
I still can't believe it.

290
00:22:24,514 --> 00:22:28,610
我今晚会给莫兰打电话。看看你能不能签个名
I'll try to call Merran tonight. Erm, see if you just sign

291
00:22:28,634 --> 00:22:31,330
所有这些，然后在一月底，你的公司税
all of those, and then at the end of January, your company tax

292
00:22:31,354 --> 00:22:33,610
你可以在网上做。
will be due and you can just do it online.

293
00:22:33,634 --> 00:22:36,170
谢谢你！没有问题。
Thank you. No problem.

294
00:22:36,194 --> 00:22:39,410
不过，你最好请个会计，拉莎，
Though, you'd be better paying for an accountant, Rasha,

295
00:22:39,434 --> 00:22:42,450
因为那些东西真的会让你头疼。
because that stuff will really do your head in.

296
00:22:42,474 --> 00:22:45,490
我爸爸不想花钱。哈!
My dad doesn't want to spend the money. Huh!

297
00:22:45,514 --> 00:22:48,194
也许你该让他来。
Well, maybe you should make him.

298
00:23:03,194 --> 00:23:04,954
谢谢你,茉莉。
Thanks, Molly.

299
00:23:09,474 --> 00:23:11,810
那是纳桑一家吗?看不见你。
Is that the Nassan family? Aye.

300
00:23:11,834 --> 00:23:16,730
我在帮拉莎接受增值税登记。
I am helping Rasha get her head around being VAT registered.

301
00:23:16,754 --> 00:23:19,250
我猜他们知道亚历克斯·加尔布雷斯的事了?
I take it they know about Alex Galbraith?

302
00:23:19,274 --> 00:23:21,754
是啊，他们很不高兴，他们把他当朋友。
Aye, they were quite upset, they considered him a friend.

303
00:23:23,834 --> 00:23:26,770
你不喜欢吗?这就是原因吗?
You not so much? Is that what this is about?

304
00:23:26,794 --> 00:23:28,570
唐娜·基利克的事让我很生气
I'm pissed off about Donna Killick.

305
00:23:28,594 --> 00:23:29,970
你想要什么?
What do you expect?

306
00:23:29,994 --> 00:23:31,954
她杀了我妹妹，然后就可以回家了
She kills my sister and then she gets to come home

307
00:23:31,978 --> 00:23:34,210
然后死在自己床上?!妈妈。
and die in her own bed?! Mum.

308
00:23:34,234 --> 00:23:38,530
我知道加尔布雷斯只是在做他的工作，但我希望他能出现
Look, I know Galbraith was only doing his job, but I wish he'd shown

309
00:23:38,554 --> 00:23:41,250
对莫莉和我的同情就像他对唐娜的同情一样
as much compassion for Molly and me as he did for Donna.

310
00:23:41,274 --> 00:23:44,170
我明白，但我还是需要那些人的名单
I hear you, but I'm still going to need the list of the people

311
00:23:44,194 --> 00:23:45,650
在你们的压力小组。
in your pressure group.

312
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:47,490
我有一份两千个人的请愿书。
I've got a petition with 2,000 names on it.

313
00:23:47,514 --> 00:23:49,034
你也想要吗?
You want that as well?

314
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:55,072
我去给你拿名单。谢谢。
I'll get you the list. Thanks.

315
00:23:59,034 --> 00:24:03,170
胡说。我在看入侵报告，加尔布雷斯案
Tosh. I'm looking at the break-in report - the Galbraith case

316
00:24:03,194 --> 00:24:05,810
失踪的文件是关于监护权的。
file that went missing was a custody case.

317
00:24:05,834 --> 00:24:09,890
凯尔和琳达·莫顿。菲奥娜·贝德福德提到过她
Kyle and Lynda Morton. Yeah, Fiona Bedford mentioned her.

318
00:24:09,914 --> 00:24:12,650
所以你应该和琳达·莫顿谈谈。
So you should speak to Lynda Morton.

319
00:24:12,674 --> 00:24:15,114
找出她今天早上在哪。
Find out where she was this morning.

320
00:24:19,154 --> 00:24:21,234
你好。嗨。嗨。
Hello. Hi. Hi.

321
00:24:28,314 --> 00:24:32,850
我母亲想知道加尔布雷斯先生的死
My mother would like to know if Mr Galbraith's death

322
00:24:32,874 --> 00:24:38,130
跟他帮我们这件事有关系吗?
had anything to do with the fact that he was helping us?

323
00:24:38,154 --> 00:24:40,674
哦，不——我们没有证据证明这一点。
Oh, no - we have no evidence to suggest that.

324
00:24:45,354 --> 00:24:46,714
谢谢你！
Thank you.

325
00:24:58,754 --> 00:25:00,394
琳达吗?
Lynda?

326
00:25:01,954 --> 00:25:04,034
嘿，有个后门。
Hey, there's a back gate.

327
00:25:21,434 --> 00:25:22,914
喂?
Hello?

328
00:25:24,914 --> 00:25:27,394
你好,警察。有人在这里吗?
Hello, police. Anyone here?

329
00:25:45,434 --> 00:25:47,034
琳达吗?
Lynda?

330
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:08,474
琳达吗?
Lynda?

331
00:26:10,914 --> 00:26:12,674
琳达，你还好吗?
Lynda, are you OK?

332
00:26:27,314 --> 00:26:29,034
你的手怎么了?
What happened to your hand?

333
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:32,074
我自己剪。
I cut myself.

334
00:26:34,674 --> 00:26:36,714
看起来需要缝针了。
Looks like it need stitches.

335
00:26:40,994 --> 00:26:45,250
你认识亚历克斯·加尔布雷斯，对吧，因为你的监护权?
You know Alex Galbraith, don't you, from your custody case?

336
00:26:45,274 --> 00:26:48,674
所以呢?那你还没听说他怎么了?
So? You haven't heard what happened to him, then?

337
00:26:50,354 --> 00:26:52,834
不,什么?他是被杀。
No, what? He's been killed.

338
00:26:54,034 --> 00:26:55,514
有人向他开枪。
Someone shot him.

339
00:26:56,914 --> 00:26:58,794
你最后一次见他是什么时候?
When was the last time you saw him?

340
00:27:02,234 --> 00:27:05,314
嗯,今天早上。
Erm, this morning.

341
00:27:07,634 --> 00:27:10,570
我去找他谈我孩子的事
I went to go and have it out with him about my kids

342
00:27:10,594 --> 00:27:12,754
但他不想和我说话。
but he didn't want to speak to me.

343
00:27:14,394 --> 00:27:17,514
在那之后呢?我回到这里。
And after that? I came back here.

344
00:27:20,234 --> 00:27:23,410
我感觉很低落，所以吃了一片安眠药。
I felt pretty low, so I took a sleeping tablet.

345
00:27:23,434 --> 00:27:25,450
有人闯入他的家
There was a break-in at his house

346
00:27:25,474 --> 00:27:28,794
最近，和你的案子有关的文件被拿走了。
recently, and a file relating to your case was taken.

347
00:27:30,114 --> 00:27:32,170
什么?
What?

348
00:27:32,194 --> 00:27:34,154
发生什么事,琳达?
What happened, Lynda?

349
00:27:37,154 --> 00:27:38,690
你不是一直这样的
You weren't always like this,

350
00:27:38,714 --> 00:27:40,634
是你吗?不,我不是。
were you? No, I wasn't.

351
00:27:43,914 --> 00:27:48,314
但我……我在努力恢复，真的。
But I'm... I'm trying to get better, I really am.

352
00:28:02,954 --> 00:28:06,274
我在案发时监控录像上看到了伊芙。
I've got Eve on CCTV at the time of the shooting.

353
00:28:10,314 --> 00:28:11,810
好的。
OK.

354
00:28:11,834 --> 00:28:15,530
那她的竞选经理呢?尼文·格思里在他的工程部
And what about her campaign manager? Niven Guthrie was at his engineering

355
00:28:15,554 --> 00:28:19,290
工厂。他的兄弟斯特鲁恩已经发表了声明。
plant. His brother, Struan, has already given a statement.

356
00:28:19,314 --> 00:28:22,130
我以为他有家建筑公司。他有一半的股份
I thought he had a building firm. He's got a stake in half

357
00:28:22,154 --> 00:28:23,690
设得兰群岛的商业。
the businesses on Shetland.

358
00:28:23,714 --> 00:28:26,650
和一个OBE。看来他已经倾尽全力了
And an OBE. Looks like he's throwing everything he's got

359
00:28:26,674 --> 00:28:28,370
夜的活动。
into Eve's campaign.

360
00:28:28,394 --> 00:28:30,650
他不会高兴的，除非他有一座自己的雕像
He won't be happy till he's got a statue of himself

361
00:28:30,674 --> 00:28:32,610
在市场十字路口。
at the Market Cross.

362
00:28:32,634 --> 00:28:34,930
有枪的痕迹吗?
OK, is there any trace of the gun?

363
00:28:34,954 --> 00:28:37,250
从我们的持枪者名册上查不到。
Not from our register of gun owners.

364
00:28:37,274 --> 00:28:39,730
我们确实有几个收藏家，但都没有
We do have a couple of collectors, but none with a

365
00:28:39,754 --> 00:28:41,330
第二次世界大战，沃尔特。
World War II Walther.

366
00:28:41,354 --> 00:28:44,170
至于子弹制造者，我们要找的是机械师
As for the bullet maker, we're looking for a machinist

367
00:28:44,194 --> 00:28:47,210
或者可能是个工程师，但同样的，设得兰群岛上似乎没有人
or maybe an engineer, but again, nobody on Shetland seems

368
00:28:47,234 --> 00:28:48,730
符合要求。
to fit the bill.

369
00:28:48,754 --> 00:28:50,570
有个小问题。当地的小伙子。
Got a wee problem. Local lad.

370
00:28:50,594 --> 00:28:51,850
弗雷泽克雷根。
Fraser Creggan.

371
00:28:51,874 --> 00:28:54,650
他一直在网上发布加尔布雷斯谋杀案的消息。
He's been posting about the Galbraith killing online.

372
00:28:54,674 --> 00:28:56,434
我觉得你应该看看。
I think you should take a look.

373
00:29:00,474 --> 00:29:02,250
真正的犯罪疯狂。
True Crime Crazy.

374
00:29:02,274 --> 00:29:03,514
是的，看看这个。
Yeah, look at this.

375
00:29:06,634 --> 00:29:09,290
好吧，那肯定是他今早打来的。
OK, so that must have been him this morning.

376
00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:10,690
坚持下去。
Hang on.

377
00:29:10,714 --> 00:29:15,450
克雷根，我们有个叫洛根·克雷根的持枪者。
Creggan - we've got a Logan Creggan on our register of gun owners.

378
00:29:15,474 --> 00:29:18,050
好吧，我们会查出他们是否有血缘关系，比利，
OK, we'll find out if they're related and, Billy,

379
00:29:18,074 --> 00:29:20,890
马上关闭这个网站。
shut this site down, pronto.

380
00:29:20,914 --> 00:29:23,090
琳达没有不在场证明。
Lynda doesn't have an alibi.

381
00:29:23,114 --> 00:29:25,650
她一个人在公寓里，但说实话，我看不清
She was alone in her flat, but to be honest, I can't see

382
00:29:25,674 --> 00:29:27,272
她拍摄任何人。
her shooting anyone.

383
00:29:29,794 --> 00:29:32,512
她可能认识会这么做的人。
I mean, she might know somebody that would.

384
00:29:35,914 --> 00:29:38,594
好了，今晚就到此为止吧。
OK, let's call it a night.

385
00:29:39,794 --> 00:29:42,114
看你早上精神抖擞的样子。
See you all bright and breezy in the morning.

386
00:29:44,394 --> 00:29:47,170
卡西。鹰降落了。
Cassie. The eagle has landed.

387
00:29:47,194 --> 00:29:50,034
但我没法让他吃东西。他一直说他已经吃过了
But I can't get him to eat anything. He keeps saying he's already eaten,

388
00:29:50,058 --> 00:29:52,250
但他没有。
but he hasn't.

389
00:29:52,274 --> 00:29:53,834
好吧,嗯……
All right, erm...

390
00:29:55,314 --> 00:29:59,330
别担心，我会在回家的路上买的。
Don't worry, I'll - I'll pick something up on the way home.

391
00:29:59,354 --> 00:30:01,474
好吗?再见。
OK? Bye.

392
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:12,834
你还好吗?
How are you holding up?

393
00:30:17,394 --> 00:30:19,154
我也有过好日子，托什。
I've had better days, Tosh.

394
00:30:22,474 --> 00:30:25,434
如果你想谈谈，我是个很好的倾听者。
If you need to talk, I'm a good listener.

395
00:30:26,874 --> 00:30:29,274
谢谢，我接受你的建议。
Thanks, I may take you up on that.

396
00:30:32,114 --> 00:30:33,850
夜晚。
Night-night.

397
00:30:33,874 --> 00:30:35,154
的夜晚。
Night.

398
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:57,690
嗨,凯莉。
Hey, Carrie.

399
00:30:57,714 --> 00:31:01,250
我不知道你也轮班。众所周知的坏钱。
Oh, I didn't know you were on this shift. Proverbial bad penny.

400
00:31:01,274 --> 00:31:02,530
晚餐吃什么?
What's for dinner?

401
00:31:02,554 --> 00:31:04,650
希望不是又做了那种慢炖羊肉。
I hope it's not that slow-cooked lamb thing again.

402
00:31:04,674 --> 00:31:06,370
吐司上的屎，对吧?
Shite on toast, will that do you?

403
00:31:06,394 --> 00:31:07,930
我跟你说……
I tell you what...

404
00:31:07,954 --> 00:31:09,650
好好看看这张英俊的脸。
Take a good look at this handsome face.

405
00:31:09,674 --> 00:31:11,330
你可能很快就看不到了。
You might not be seeing it much longer.

406
00:31:11,354 --> 00:31:14,074
是啊，你中彩票了?可能是吧。
Oh, yeah, you won the lottery, then? Could be.

407
00:31:39,434 --> 00:31:41,474
啊,你是对的。
Aye, you're right.

408
00:31:45,514 --> 00:31:47,490
我也是认真的。
And I'm serious, as well.

409
00:31:47,514 --> 00:31:49,330
看不见你。
Aye.

410
00:31:49,354 --> 00:31:51,794
那是你的选择，但你会后悔的。
Well, that's your choice, but you'll regret it.

411
00:31:53,274 --> 00:31:54,730
你还好吗?
You OK?

412
00:31:54,754 --> 00:31:57,514
当然，不用担心。好。
Aye, sure, no worries. Good.

413
00:32:10,514 --> 00:32:12,130
你在这里做什么?
What are you doing here?

414
00:32:12,154 --> 00:32:14,570
你不是应该在费尔岛吗?
Shouldn't you be in Fair Isle?

415
00:32:14,594 --> 00:32:17,050
怎么，你没听说过亚历克斯·加尔布雷斯吗?
What, you not heard about Alex Galbraith?

416
00:32:17,074 --> 00:32:18,490
嗯,我听说过。
Well, I heard.

417
00:32:18,514 --> 00:32:22,490
我以为你会待久一点。凯西要带我爸爸来
I just thought you'd stay longer. Cassie is bringing my dad

418
00:32:22,514 --> 00:32:24,634
这样我就可以照看他一段时间。
home so that I can keep an eye on him for a wee while.

419
00:32:24,658 --> 00:32:28,138
他的记忆力真的不太好。
His memory's really - it's not great.

420
00:32:29,354 --> 00:32:31,394
所以他要和我们住一段时间。
So he's going to be staying with us for a wee while.

421
00:32:31,418 --> 00:32:34,130
你同意吗?啊,当然。
You OK with that? Aye, sure.

422
00:32:34,154 --> 00:32:35,794
我给你拿杯喝的。
Oh, let me get you a drink.

423
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,170
在房子上。
On the house.

424
00:32:44,194 --> 00:32:46,770
如果你一直这样做，你永远也赚不到钱。
You're never going to make a profit if you keep doing that.

425
00:32:46,794 --> 00:32:48,394
哦，没关系，这是你的钱。
Oh, that's OK, it's your money.

426
00:32:50,714 --> 00:32:52,234
它怎么样?
How was it?

427
00:32:53,594 --> 00:32:55,114
是啊，我们挺过来了。
Aye, we got through it.

428
00:32:56,754 --> 00:32:58,730
她的朋友们不得不跟她道别。
And her friends got to say goodbye.

429
00:32:58,754 --> 00:33:00,610
你知道,所以…
You know, so...

430
00:33:00,634 --> 00:33:04,674
和卡斯?是的，她做得很好。
And Cass? Yeah, she did really well.

431
00:33:07,594 --> 00:33:10,552
你也需要时间来哀悼，知道吗?
You're going to need time to grieve too, you know?

432
00:33:13,634 --> 00:33:15,074
还有。
And there's that.

433
00:33:17,034 --> 00:33:18,274
对，就是这样。
Aye, and there's that.

434
00:33:19,314 --> 00:33:21,010
她肯定会回来的?
She's definitely coming back, then?

435
00:33:21,034 --> 00:33:23,250
是啊，我也无能为力，邓肯。
Yeah, there's nothing I can do about it, Duncan.

436
00:33:23,274 --> 00:33:25,850
不,我知道。你要做的事够多了。
No, I know. Got enough on your plate.

437
00:33:25,874 --> 00:33:28,850
是啊，但你知道，尽量不去想它。
Yeah, but you know, try not to think about it.

438
00:33:28,874 --> 00:33:30,690
因为事实是，
Because the truth is,

439
00:33:30,714 --> 00:33:32,634
她不会在这里待那么久的。
she's not going to be here that long.

440
00:33:37,034 --> 00:33:42,234
你有食物要我带走吗?你做的意大利面。
Look, you got any food I could take away? That pasta thing you do.

441
00:33:43,634 --> 00:33:44,834
这意大利面吗?
That pasta thing?

442
00:33:46,714 --> 00:33:47,914
确定。
Sure.

443
00:34:05,994 --> 00:34:08,194
我们回来后他就一直坐在那。
He's been sitting there since we got back.

444
00:34:11,274 --> 00:34:12,970
爸爸。
Dad.

445
00:34:12,994 --> 00:34:14,194
我有吃的。
I got some food.

446
00:34:16,914 --> 00:34:18,634
听着，我接到一个电话。
Listen, I got a call.

447
00:34:19,794 --> 00:34:21,970
他们要我回去工作。
They want me back at work.

448
00:34:21,994 --> 00:34:23,354
我明早得走了。
I have to go in the morning.

449
00:34:24,554 --> 00:34:26,170
当然可以。
Of course.

450
00:34:26,194 --> 00:34:28,554
别为我们担心，我们会没事的。
Don't you worry about us, we're going to be fine.

451
00:34:52,434 --> 00:34:55,570
我听说你和警察谈过了。
I heard you were talking to the cops.

452
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:57,730
他们在问关于亚历克斯·加尔布雷斯的事。
They were asking about Alex Galbraith.

453
00:34:57,754 --> 00:34:59,970
你最好在任何地方都不要提到我的名字
You'd better not have mentioned my name in any part

454
00:34:59,994 --> 00:35:02,530
那次谈话，琳达。
of that conversation, Lynda.

455
00:35:02,554 --> 00:35:04,154
我是认真的。
I fucking mean it.

456
00:35:05,154 --> 00:35:09,410
如果你让我参与其中，我们就都完蛋了。
If you've dropped me in any of that, we're both screwed.

457
00:35:09,434 --> 00:35:10,954
我没有，我保证。
I didn't, I promise.

458
00:35:14,634 --> 00:35:15,874
喝点什么?
Anything to drink?

459
00:35:34,994 --> 00:35:36,754
孩子们，是你们吗?
Kids, is that you?

460
00:35:46,514 --> 00:35:48,274
有人有吗?
Anybody there?

461
00:35:57,394 --> 00:35:59,034
我已经报警了。
I've called the police.

462
00:36:44,514 --> 00:36:46,530
早....早....
Morning. Morning.

463
00:36:46,554 --> 00:36:50,570
我昨晚在看加尔布雷斯的案子。在托管
Erm, I was going over Galbraith's cases last night. On the custody

464
00:36:50,594 --> 00:36:54,250
他记下了琳达·莫顿的证据
case, he made a note that there's evidence linking Lynda Morton

465
00:36:54,274 --> 00:36:55,690
给当地的毒贩。
to local drug dealers.

466
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:57,930
他没有在法庭上使用。他不需要。
He didn't use it in court. He didn't need to.

467
00:36:57,954 --> 00:37:01,130
但你说她认识枪手可能是对的。
But you might be right about her knowing the shooter.

468
00:37:01,154 --> 00:37:05,370
也许能解释加尔布雷斯家被闯入的原因。
Well, might help explain the break-in at the Galbraith house.

469
00:37:05,394 --> 00:37:08,314
来，去看看她跟谁混在一起了。
Here, go and have a look and see who she was mixing with.

470
00:37:11,114 --> 00:37:15,330
我查了洛根·克雷根和加尔布雷斯有没有关系。
So I checked if Logan Creggan has any links to Galbraith.

471
00:37:15,354 --> 00:37:19,090
克雷根几年前请加尔布雷斯做他的代理律师。
It appears Creggan asked Galbraith to represent him, a few years back.

472
00:37:19,114 --> 00:37:20,810
他拒绝了。
He refused.

473
00:37:20,834 --> 00:37:23,170
我不知道原因，也不知道案子是什么。
I don't know why, or what the case was.

474
00:37:23,194 --> 00:37:25,794
我以为他会帮助任何人。
I thought he was the guy who would help anybody.

475
00:37:42,834 --> 00:37:46,770
洛根克雷根?我是佩雷斯局长，介意我说句话吗
Logan Creggan? I'm DI Perez, do you mind if I have a word

476
00:37:46,794 --> 00:37:48,330
和你的男孩?
with your boy?

477
00:37:48,354 --> 00:37:51,554
关于什么?这对加尔布雷斯吗?
What about? This about Galbraith?

478
00:37:52,954 --> 00:37:58,330
你为什么这么说?本周在设得兰发生了另一件事。
Why do you say that? It's something else happened in Shetland this week.

479
00:37:58,354 --> 00:38:01,074
我相信你家里有枪。
I believe you've got guns in your house.

480
00:38:12,714 --> 00:38:14,130
我刚洗过。
I just cleaned it.

481
00:38:14,154 --> 00:38:16,690
我在部队时养成的习惯。
A habit I picked up in the Forces.

482
00:38:16,714 --> 00:38:20,434
你服役多长时间?十年。
How long did you serve? Ten years.

483
00:38:24,714 --> 00:38:26,834
你会成为犯罪航行者。
Oh, you'll be the Crime Voyager.

484
00:38:31,634 --> 00:38:34,370
你让亚历克斯·加尔布雷斯代理你的案子
You asked Alex Galbraith to represent you in a case

485
00:38:34,394 --> 00:38:36,970
一段时间回来。那是怎么回事?
a while back. What was that about?

486
00:38:36,994 --> 00:38:39,290
这是私人的。
It's private.

487
00:38:39,314 --> 00:38:40,754
没有任何更多。
Not any more.

488
00:38:42,514 --> 00:38:45,450
我收到了检察院的一封信，上面说
I got a letter from the Service Prosecuting Authority saying

489
00:38:45,474 --> 00:38:47,874
我正在接受IHAT的调查。
I was being investigated by IHAT.

490
00:38:49,354 --> 00:38:51,354
历史性的指控团队?
Historic Allegations Team?

491
00:38:52,994 --> 00:38:55,994
和什么有关?它并没有透露这一信息。
In relation to what? It didn't share that information.

492
00:38:57,554 --> 00:38:59,490
然后他们撤销了指控
And then they dropped the charges.

493
00:38:59,514 --> 00:39:01,914
他肯定有什么想法。
Well, he must have had some idea.

494
00:39:05,594 --> 00:39:09,210
可能是伊拉克对被拘留者的虐待。
Probably the mistreatment of detainees in Iraq.

495
00:39:09,234 --> 00:39:11,450
人们从木框里走出来
People were coming out of the woodwork,

496
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:14,410
声称他们受到了虐待，要求赔偿。
claiming they were tortured, looking for compensation.

497
00:39:14,434 --> 00:39:17,970
等不及要把我这样的人钉死在十字架上了。
Couldn't wait to crucify people like me.

498
00:39:17,994 --> 00:39:20,394
你是说那些事都没发生过吗?
Are you saying stuff like that didn't happen?

499
00:39:22,314 --> 00:39:23,594
不。
No.

500
00:39:24,754 --> 00:39:26,394
只是不是我。
Just not by me.

501
00:39:28,274 --> 00:39:31,610
但亚历克斯·加尔布雷斯不会为你辩护?
But Alex Galbraith wouldn't represent you?

502
00:39:31,634 --> 00:39:35,050
我和亚历克斯十几岁的时候就认识了。
I had known Alex since we were teenagers.

503
00:39:35,074 --> 00:39:38,170
我们曾经很亲密。
And we were pretty close for a time.

504
00:39:38,194 --> 00:39:40,330
每个人都值得辩护
Everyone deserves a defense,

505
00:39:40,354 --> 00:39:43,114
不管他们犯了什么罪，他总是这么说。
no matter their crime - that's what he always said.

506
00:39:45,434 --> 00:39:48,154
结果他说的是所有人，除了我。
Turns out, he meant everyone except me.

507
00:39:49,434 --> 00:39:51,034
这让你烦恼吗?
Did that annoy you?

508
00:39:52,114 --> 00:39:53,754
不足以射杀他。
Not enough to shoot him.

509
00:39:56,834 --> 00:39:59,330
昨天上午11点左右你在哪里?
Where were you yesterday morning about 11?

510
00:39:59,354 --> 00:40:01,114
我在设兔子陷阱。
I was setting rabbit traps.

511
00:40:02,714 --> 00:40:04,554
你妻子支持你?
Your wife back you up?

512
00:40:05,634 --> 00:40:07,290
我们分开。
We're separated.

513
00:40:07,314 --> 00:40:09,794
她在大陆上，戈尔斯皮。
She's on the mainland, Golspie.

514
00:40:11,034 --> 00:40:15,010
你就相信我吧。
You'll just have to take my word for it.

515
00:40:15,034 --> 00:40:17,354
介意我跟弗雷泽说句话吗?
Mind if I have a quick word with Fraser?

516
00:40:28,474 --> 00:40:30,770
是利奥波德和勒布吗?
Is that Leopold and Loeb?

517
00:40:30,794 --> 00:40:33,250
你听说过吗?
You've heard of them?

518
00:40:33,274 --> 00:40:34,474
看不见你。
Aye.

519
00:40:36,234 --> 00:40:41,450
难道他们不相信自然界关于超人的概念吗，
Didn't they believe in nature's concept of Ubermenschen,

520
00:40:41,474 --> 00:40:45,050
他们凌驾于普通人的道德权威之上
and that they were above the moral authority of ordinary people,

521
00:40:45,074 --> 00:40:48,610
然后他们杀了一个14岁的男孩来证明吗?
and then they killed a 14-year-old boy to prove it?

522
00:40:48,634 --> 00:40:51,354
还不止这些。是吗?
Bit more to it than that. Is there?

523
00:40:52,514 --> 00:40:54,490
是啊，可惜他们留下了一副眼镜
Yeah, it's a pity that they left a pair of glasses

524
00:40:54,514 --> 00:40:56,410
在犯罪现场。
at the crime scene.

525
00:40:56,434 --> 00:40:59,330
不太像超人，对吧?
Not very Ubermenschen, that, was it?

526
00:40:59,354 --> 00:41:02,370
在我看来，他们是一对变态的混蛋。
As far as I can see, they were a couple of sick bastards.

527
00:41:02,394 --> 00:41:06,490
弗雷泽，在你的网站上，你贴了照片
Fraser, on your website, you've posted photographs

528
00:41:06,514 --> 00:41:09,050
调查加尔布雷斯案的警官
of police officers working on the Galbraith case.

529
00:41:09,074 --> 00:41:11,330
你不能这么做。
You can't do that.

530
00:41:11,354 --> 00:41:13,250
这是正在进行的调查
It's an ongoing investigation,

531
00:41:13,274 --> 00:41:15,170
你必须置身事外，好吗?
and you have to stay out of it, OK?

532
00:41:15,194 --> 00:41:17,554
他会的，我会保证的。
He will, I'll make sure of it.

533
00:41:19,314 --> 00:41:21,810
你一定很兴奋吧。
Must be exciting for you.

534
00:41:21,834 --> 00:41:25,170
有一个完美的谋杀案要解决。
Having a perfect murder to solve.

535
00:41:25,194 --> 00:41:27,114
谁说它是完美的?
Who said it was perfect?

536
00:41:39,554 --> 00:41:43,610
据邻居们说，琳达有个常客，他们认为是那个人
From what the neighbours say, Linda had a regular visitor who they think

537
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:47,170
看起来有点可疑。我问过缉毒局他们是否在监视她。
looked a bit shifty. I've asked drug enforcement if she's on their radar.

538
00:41:47,194 --> 00:41:48,370
好。
Good.

539
00:41:48,394 --> 00:41:51,570
与检察机关取得联系。
Get in touch with the service prosecuting authority.

540
00:41:51,594 --> 00:41:53,690
洛根·克雷根正在接受调查，我想
Logan Creggan was under investigation and I want

541
00:41:53,714 --> 00:41:55,450
了解细节。
to know the details.

542
00:41:55,474 --> 00:41:57,930
而且，他没有不在场证明。
Also, he doesn't have an alibi.

543
00:41:57,954 --> 00:42:00,810
有可能伊芙在战争罪上的立场
And it's just possible that Eve's position on war crimes

544
00:42:00,834 --> 00:42:04,930
只是揭开了一些旧伤疤。
has just opened up some old wounds.

545
00:42:04,954 --> 00:42:08,410
也和弗雷泽的老师谈谈。调查一下他的背景。
And talk to Fraser's teachers, as well. Get some background on him.

546
00:42:08,434 --> 00:42:09,890
我没有时间。
I don't have time.

547
00:42:09,914 --> 00:42:13,050
你去那边找个制服吧?看看就知道了。
Why don't you get a uniform over there? Just take a look.

548
00:42:13,074 --> 00:42:16,850
在去赫利斯特的路上。去赫利斯特的路上有什么?
It's on the road to Hellister. What's on the road to Hellister?

549
00:42:16,874 --> 00:42:18,154
磨合。
A break-in.

550
00:42:20,194 --> 00:42:22,170
那离加尔布雷斯家不远。
That's not far from Galbraith's house.

551
00:42:22,194 --> 00:42:23,874
拍摄什么?一个无人驾驶飞机。
What was taken? A drone.

552
00:42:27,154 --> 00:42:29,930
我还以为是我开着的门砰的一声。
I thought it was just a door banging that I'd left open.

553
00:42:29,954 --> 00:42:32,850
不。看来是有人强迫的。
No. Looks like somebody forced it.

554
00:42:32,874 --> 00:42:37,530
你丈夫用无人机做什么?摄影。
What does your husband use the drone for? Photography.

555
00:42:37,554 --> 00:42:39,730
这是他的爱好。
It's his hobby.

556
00:42:39,754 --> 00:42:41,570
他最后一次用是什么时候?
And when did he last use it?

557
00:42:41,594 --> 00:42:45,170
昨天早上。他在外面沿着海岸飞来飞去。
Yesterday morning. He was out flying up and down the coast.

558
00:42:45,194 --> 00:42:47,450
所以他会跳过加尔布雷斯家吗?
So he would have passed over the Galbraith house?

559
00:42:47,474 --> 00:42:48,970
我想是的。
I would think so.

560
00:42:48,994 --> 00:42:52,170
他在吗?我想跟你说几句话。
Is he around? I'd like to have a quick word.

561
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:54,290
他在工作。
He's at work.

562
00:42:54,314 --> 00:42:56,370
他说看到什么了?
He mentioned seeing anything?

563
00:42:56,394 --> 00:42:59,234
如果他知道，我想他会说的。
If he had, I think he would have said.

564
00:43:03,474 --> 00:43:05,314
那是血吗?
Is that blood?

565
00:43:06,394 --> 00:43:09,490
桑迪，你能拿个样本吗?
Sandy, can you get a sample of that?

566
00:43:09,514 --> 00:43:12,530
当然可以。你有他的联系电话吗?
Of course. Do you have a contact number for him?

567
00:43:12,554 --> 00:43:14,290
我真的很想和他谈谈。
I'd really like to speak to him.

568
00:43:14,314 --> 00:43:16,130
这可能很难。
That might be difficult.

569
00:43:16,154 --> 00:43:19,554
他在维修尼尼安的一条管道。
He's doing maintenance on a Ninian pipeline.

570
00:43:31,874 --> 00:43:34,250
冠军宝座。
Eamon.

571
00:43:34,274 --> 00:43:35,770
你还好吗?
Are you feeling OK?

572
00:43:35,794 --> 00:43:38,970
你准备好了吗当然，你为什么这么问?
Are you up for this? Of course, why are you asking?

573
00:43:38,994 --> 00:43:41,330
我只是想确认一下你现在的心境是否正常。
I'm just making sure you're in the right frame of mind.

574
00:43:41,354 --> 00:43:43,130
你昨晚看起来有点紧张。
You seemed a bit on edge last night.

575
00:43:43,154 --> 00:43:45,234
不，只是个家庭纠纷。
No, it was just a domestic, eh.

576
00:43:47,074 --> 00:43:48,274
好的。
OK.

577
00:44:09,154 --> 00:44:11,930
好了，埃蒙，潜水深度是200米。你们
OK, Eamon, the dive depth will be 200 metres. You guys

578
00:44:11,954 --> 00:44:13,554
一切都满意吗?
happy with everything?

579
00:44:23,514 --> 00:44:27,170
听着，有可能这个埃蒙·高迪
Listen, it's possible that this guy Eamon Gauldie

580
00:44:27,194 --> 00:44:31,490
无意中拍下了凶手离开犯罪现场的画面，
has inadvertently filmed the killer leaving the crime scene,

581
00:44:31,514 --> 00:44:33,850
就是他拿走了无人机。
and that's who's taken the drone.

582
00:44:33,874 --> 00:44:35,810
如果是这样，我们得找到他。是吗?
If that's the case, we need to find him. Yeah?

583
00:44:35,834 --> 00:44:38,530
谢谢你！确定。
Thank you. Sure.

584
00:44:38,554 --> 00:44:40,450
高迪已经开始潜水了。
Gauldie has started his dive.

585
00:44:40,474 --> 00:44:42,570
但我做了个简短的背景调查。
But I did a quick background check.

586
00:44:42,594 --> 00:44:45,730
几年前他卷入了一桩官司。
He was involved in a court case a few years ago.

587
00:44:45,754 --> 00:44:47,490
攻击。
Assault.

588
00:44:47,514 --> 00:44:48,810
别告诉我
Don't tell me -

589
00:44:48,834 --> 00:44:51,490
加尔布雷斯为他辩护?不。
Galbraith defended him? No.

590
00:44:51,514 --> 00:44:54,490
加尔布雷斯是另一个人的律师。
Galbraith represented the other guy.

591
00:44:54,514 --> 00:44:56,632
叫他们把他带上来。
Tell them to bring him back up.

592
00:45:01,154 --> 00:45:03,130
你还好吗?
Are you OK?

593
00:45:03,154 --> 00:45:04,994
等一下，慢点。
Hang on, just slow down.

594
00:45:08,274 --> 00:45:10,130
你刚才看到了吗?
And you saw this just now?

595
00:45:10,154 --> 00:45:11,914
看,我会的。我保证。
Look, I will. I promise.

596
00:45:13,634 --> 00:45:15,114
这是凯特。
That was Kate.

597
00:45:16,154 --> 00:45:18,890
《纪事报》刚刚刊登了犯罪现场的照片
The Chronicle have just published crime-scene photographs

598
00:45:18,914 --> 00:45:20,474
网上她妹妹的照片。
of her sister online.

599
00:45:24,154 --> 00:45:27,290
这些从未向公众公布。
These were never released to the public.

600
00:45:27,314 --> 00:45:29,690
他们是怎么拿到的?
How the hell did they get hold of them?

601
00:45:29,714 --> 00:45:32,914
肯定是有人黑进了我们的系统下载了。
Somebody must have hacked into our system and downloaded them.

602
00:45:34,274 --> 00:45:36,594
比利，把麦克贝叫来。
Billy, get MacBay in here now.

603
00:45:41,194 --> 00:45:43,010
你从哪里得到这些图像的?
Where did you get these images?

604
00:45:43,034 --> 00:45:45,770
他们被张贴在办公室的前门。
They were posted through the front door of the office.

605
00:45:45,794 --> 00:45:47,490
没有邮票。
No stamp.

606
00:45:47,514 --> 00:45:50,330
可能是同情基尔缪尔一家的人。
Probably someone sympathetic to the Kilmuir family.

607
00:45:50,354 --> 00:45:51,890
看不见你。
Aye.

608
00:45:51,914 --> 00:45:56,050
有人想在唐娜被释放这件事上火上浇油
Somebody looking to pour fuel on the fire over Donna's release and

609
00:45:56,074 --> 00:45:58,730
你只是很乐意帮忙。
you were just happy to oblige.

610
00:45:58,754 --> 00:46:00,810
这是为了公众的利益。
It's in the public interest.

611
00:46:00,834 --> 00:46:02,354
不,这是无情的。
No, it's heartless.

612
00:46:03,354 --> 00:46:05,730
这些是警方的财产，你得拿走它们
These are police property and you're going to take them

613
00:46:05,754 --> 00:46:08,154
趴下，你现在就来。
down and you're going to do it now.

614
00:46:12,354 --> 00:46:14,410
比利。
Billy.

615
00:46:14,434 --> 00:46:17,810
这些都是用电脑打印出来的，也许是扫描出来的。
These have been printed out on a computer - scanned, maybe.

616
00:46:17,834 --> 00:46:20,730
检查一下原件是否还在停尸房和柯拉在一起。
Check if the originals are still with Cora at the mortuary.

617
00:46:20,754 --> 00:46:23,770
然后联系阿伯丁的数字调查组。
And then get on to the Digital Investigation Team in Aberdeen.

618
00:46:23,794 --> 00:46:26,690
如果它们被下载了，我们得追踪到是谁。
If they were downloaded, we need be able to trace who by.

619
00:46:26,714 --> 00:46:28,490
不，它们被雪压住了。
No, they're snowed under.

620
00:46:28,514 --> 00:46:31,050
他们要过几周才能找到我们。
It'll be weeks before they get to us.

621
00:46:31,074 --> 00:46:33,450
唐尼能做到。
Donnie could do it.

622
00:46:33,474 --> 00:46:36,210
他就是这样，半人半电脑。
It's what he does - he's half man, half laptop.

623
00:46:36,234 --> 00:46:38,114
可能会加快速度。
Might speed things up.

624
00:46:40,154 --> 00:46:42,450
好的。检查一下一切都是光明正大的
OK. Check that everything's above board,

625
00:46:42,474 --> 00:46:45,130
因为如果我们需要利用他发现的任何东西，我们做不到
because if we need to use anything that he discovers, we cannae

626
00:46:45,154 --> 00:46:48,650
冒着被扔掉的风险。我不知道这是否重要，
risk it being thrown out. And I don't know if this is significant,

627
00:46:48,674 --> 00:46:51,890
但是弗雷泽·克雷根曾经入侵过他学校的电脑系统
but Fraser Creggan once hacked into his school computer system -

628
00:46:51,914 --> 00:46:54,970
他被开除了。他很聪明，不会
you know, got himself expelled. And he's smart enough not

629
00:46:54,994 --> 00:46:57,274
把它们放到自己的网站上。
to put them up on his own website.

630
00:47:04,914 --> 00:47:06,810
嗨。
Hi.

631
00:47:06,834 --> 00:47:08,034
嗨,莫莉。
Hi, Molly.

632
00:47:10,074 --> 00:47:13,170
你应该听说过莫莉姨妈的照片吧
I suppose you've heard that photographs of Molly's aunt

633
00:47:13,194 --> 00:47:14,370
在网上发布。
were posted online.

634
00:47:14,394 --> 00:47:17,370
被复制并留在了《纪事报》，但有人黑了
They were copied and left at the Chronicle, but someone hacked

635
00:47:17,394 --> 00:47:20,170
进入我们的系统，把他们放在第一位。
into our system to get them in the first place.

636
00:47:20,194 --> 00:47:22,010
我帮不了你。好的。
I can't help you. OK.

637
00:47:22,034 --> 00:47:23,850
昨天你去之前在哪里
Where were you yesterday before you went

638
00:47:23,874 --> 00:47:26,250
去加尔布雷斯的地方?
up to the Galbraith place?

639
00:47:26,274 --> 00:47:28,490
和我在一起。
With me.

640
00:47:28,514 --> 00:47:30,314
我们一起来的。
We were here together.

641
00:47:34,634 --> 00:47:38,410
好的。弗雷泽，我要没收你的电脑，
OK. Fraser, I'm going to have to confiscate your desktop,

642
00:47:38,434 --> 00:47:41,690
你的智能手机和其他任何设备。你可以拥有它们
your smartphone and any other devices you have. You can have them

643
00:47:41,714 --> 00:47:45,050
等我们查完他们就回来。
back once we've run a check on them.

644
00:47:45,074 --> 00:47:46,914
什么都没做!
Didn't do anything!

645
00:47:57,194 --> 00:48:00,130
我儿子和加尔布雷斯的死没有任何关系。
My boy had nothing to do with Galbraith's death.

646
00:48:00,154 --> 00:48:01,890
我从没说过他有。
I never said he did.

647
00:48:01,914 --> 00:48:04,410
不，但这是你的想法。
No, but it's what you think.

648
00:48:04,434 --> 00:48:09,130
我认为他对做坏事的人很着迷。
What I think is that he's fascinated by people who do bad things.

649
00:48:09,154 --> 00:48:13,114
但你比我更清楚原因。
But you'd have a much better idea why that is than me.

650
00:48:22,874 --> 00:48:26,530
看看这个桌面，看看主人是否黑进了我们的系统。
Take a look at this desktop - see if the owner hacked into our system.

651
00:48:26,554 --> 00:48:29,370
我们还有一些莉齐·基尔缪尔的照片。
Also, we've got some images of Lizzie Kilmuir.

652
00:48:29,394 --> 00:48:31,370
能查出是哪个装置吗
Is it possible to find out which device

653
00:48:31,394 --> 00:48:33,130
是打印的还是扫描的?
they were printed or scanned on?

654
00:48:33,154 --> 00:48:35,074
是的。我看看能帮上什么忙。
Yeah. Er, I'll see what I can do.

655
00:48:39,994 --> 00:48:42,514
主办公室也禁止入内。
And the main office is off limits.

656
00:48:43,674 --> 00:48:46,034
哦，是的，那不是问题。
Oh, yeah, that's not a problem.

657
00:48:55,754 --> 00:48:58,370
来吧，我们把东西收拾一下。
Come on, let's get our stuff together.

658
00:48:58,394 --> 00:49:00,274
他们说我们可以回家了。
They've said we can go home.

659
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:04,930
我不能回那栋房子。
I can't go back to that house.

660
00:49:04,954 --> 00:49:07,650
我们没得选，亲爱的。
We don't have a choice, darling.

661
00:49:07,674 --> 00:49:10,010
我们还能去哪里?
Where else will we go?

662
00:49:10,034 --> 00:49:11,434
这不是安全的。
It's not safe.

663
00:49:12,874 --> 00:49:15,530
房子周围会有保安。
There'll be security all around the house.

664
00:49:15,554 --> 00:49:19,154
我们将是设得兰群岛最安全的人。我不会回去的。
We will be the safest people in Shetland. I'm not going back.

665
00:49:36,554 --> 00:49:39,450
你到底在搞什么鬼?你从哪儿弄来的?
What the hell are you playing at, huh? Where did you get that?

666
00:49:39,474 --> 00:49:40,570
莫莉给我的。
Molly gave me it.

667
00:49:40,594 --> 00:49:43,530
你别再发这些狗屁了!
You need to stop posting this shit!

668
00:49:43,554 --> 00:49:46,370
你只是在吸引别人的注意。
You're just attracting attention to yourself.

669
00:49:46,394 --> 00:49:47,970
他们觉得你是个怪胎。
They think you're a fucking weirdo.

670
00:49:47,994 --> 00:49:49,450
我是一个怪人?
I'm a weirdo?

671
00:49:49,474 --> 00:49:52,570
不是我在他睡觉时又喊又哭，又喝酒
It's not me screaming and crying in his sleep, drinking

672
00:49:52,594 --> 00:49:53,874
自己死。
himself to death.

673
00:49:55,194 --> 00:49:57,090
我爱你，孩子!
I love you, boy!

674
00:49:57,114 --> 00:50:00,634
但你要是再这样跟我说话，我就…什么?
But you ever speak to me like that again and I'll... What?

675
00:50:06,714 --> 00:50:11,034
我只是…不想让他们因为你没做过的事而指责你。
I just... don't want them accusing you of something you haven't done.

676
00:50:25,154 --> 00:50:26,970
他们把他带回来了。
They're bringing him back up.

677
00:50:26,994 --> 00:50:28,890
问题吗?不确定。
Problem? Not sure.

678
00:50:28,914 --> 00:50:30,834
不过它们需要食物。
They'll be needing fed, though.

679
00:50:53,794 --> 00:50:55,474
Grub。
Grub's up.

680
00:51:21,834 --> 00:51:24,210
嗨。一切都好吗?
Hi. Is everything OK?

681
00:51:24,234 --> 00:51:25,594
对不起,吉米。
I'm sorry, Jimmy.

682
00:51:26,834 --> 00:51:28,690
她不愿回家。
She won't go home.

683
00:51:28,714 --> 00:51:30,250
她在浴室里。
She's in the bathroom.

684
00:51:30,274 --> 00:51:31,770
她不会说话。
She won't talk.

685
00:51:31,794 --> 00:51:34,090
哦,嗯…
Oh, um...

686
00:51:34,114 --> 00:51:37,154
好吧，我试试。
OK, I'll-I'll give it a go.

687
00:51:46,234 --> 00:51:50,010
梅兰，我是吉米·佩雷斯。
Hey, Merran, it's Jimmy Perez.

688
00:51:50,034 --> 00:51:53,050
你妈妈说你…
Your mum says that you...

689
00:51:53,074 --> 00:51:55,450
你不想回家。
you don't want to go home.

690
00:51:55,474 --> 00:51:56,674
是这样吗?
Is that right?

691
00:51:59,594 --> 00:52:02,394
我真的不怪你。
You know, I really don't blame you.

692
00:52:04,754 --> 00:52:07,410
因为当你失去某人的时候
Because when you lose somebody

693
00:52:07,434 --> 00:52:09,634
你爱的人是谁?
who's that close to you and you love...

694
00:52:13,314 --> 00:52:15,130
这是……
It's...

695
00:52:15,154 --> 00:52:18,034
就像世界停止了运转。
It's like the world just stopped.

696
00:52:25,514 --> 00:52:27,074
它是累人的。
It's exhausting.

697
00:52:28,514 --> 00:52:30,514
因为没人懂。
Because nobody gets it.

698
00:52:32,114 --> 00:52:33,514
不是真的。
Not really.

699
00:52:36,754 --> 00:52:40,490
你只需要继续努力，
You've just got to try and keep on going,

700
00:52:40,514 --> 00:52:43,610
不管有多难，因为，
regardless of how hard it is, because,

701
00:52:43,634 --> 00:52:45,874
说实话，没有别的办法了。
honestly, there's nothing else to be done.

702
00:53:25,794 --> 00:53:30,210
我们什么时候能比对车库血迹的DNA ?
When are we going to get a DNA hit on the blood from the garage?

703
00:53:30,234 --> 00:53:32,674
那需要几天时间。
That'll be a couple of days.

704
00:53:33,714 --> 00:53:35,690
我将追逐它。
I'll chase it.

705
00:53:35,714 --> 00:53:37,914
缉毒局没有琳达的证据。
Drug enforcement have got nothing on Lynda.

706
00:53:41,794 --> 00:53:43,410
比利。
Billy.

707
00:53:43,434 --> 00:53:46,610
高迪，他会被关进减压室
Gauldie - he's going to be in a decompression chamber

708
00:53:46,634 --> 00:53:49,290
几天。对此我们无能为力。
for a few days. Nothing we can do about that.

709
00:53:49,314 --> 00:53:52,570
要我打电话给潜水船，看看能不能和他谈谈吗?
You want me to call the dive boat, see if we can talk to him?

710
00:53:52,594 --> 00:53:53,954
这样做。
Do it.

711
00:53:55,314 --> 00:53:57,050
我们不接受陆上打来的电话。
We can't accept calls from onshore.

712
00:53:57,074 --> 00:53:59,890
告诉他们我们会把电话从桥上转过去。
Tell them we'll divert the call from the bridge.

713
00:53:59,914 --> 00:54:03,570
好吧，但我们需要时间先隔离他。
OK, but we need time to isolate him first.

714
00:54:03,594 --> 00:54:04,794
好的。
OK.

715
00:54:06,514 --> 00:54:07,850
什么事那么匆忙?
What's the rush?

716
00:54:07,874 --> 00:54:10,594
他们就不能等他出了房间再说吗?
Can they not wait till he's out of his chamber?

717
00:54:13,154 --> 00:54:15,210
在潜水船上等着我们。
Just waiting on the dive boat getting back to us.

718
00:54:15,234 --> 00:54:17,850
可能需要一段时间。他们说他听起来像个
Could be a while. And they say he'll sound like a

719
00:54:17,874 --> 00:54:20,610
和花栗鼠说话的时候。天啊，比利，我不管他
chipmunk when we do talk to him. Jesus, Billy, I don't care what he

720
00:54:20,634 --> 00:54:22,714
听起来，我们只需要和他谈谈!
sounds like, we just need to speak to him!

721
00:54:27,874 --> 00:54:31,674
你该回家了。看看你爸爸，你有时间。
You should go home. Check on your dad - you've got time.

722
00:54:49,474 --> 00:54:51,114
你坐在黑暗里，爸爸。
You're sitting in the dark, Dad.

723
