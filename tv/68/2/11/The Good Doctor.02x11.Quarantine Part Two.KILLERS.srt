1
00:00:00,073 --> 00:00:01,893
Previously on "The Good Doctor"...

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:02,952
I'm covering the E.R. today.

3
00:00:04,213 --> 00:00:07,057
- Gonna be a madhouse.
- Yeah.

4
00:00:07,059 --> 00:00:10,250
This emergency room and everyone
in it is now under quarantine.

5
00:00:10,275 --> 00:00:13,375
A serious respiratory virus
has infected three patients.

6
00:00:13,378 --> 00:00:14,945
Take me to the hospital.

7
00:00:14,946 --> 00:00:16,379
We are going to your appointment

8
00:00:16,381 --> 00:00:17,914
and making sure your think-melon

9
00:00:17,916 --> 00:00:19,115
remains tumor-free.

10
00:00:19,117 --> 00:00:21,251
I no longer have an immune system.

11
00:00:21,253 --> 00:00:23,152
My donor's on his way, right?

12
00:00:23,155 --> 00:00:25,288
Why are you answering our donor's phone?

13
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:27,957
Because he's here in quarantine.

14
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,693
My wife's in there.
I need to get in there.

15
00:00:29,695 --> 00:00:31,161
If something happens to me,

16
00:00:31,163 --> 00:00:33,662
our son needs someone
to take care of him.

17
00:00:33,664 --> 00:00:35,064
Put your mask back on.

18
00:00:35,067 --> 00:00:36,165
Why?

19
00:00:36,167 --> 00:00:37,500
Because I'm infected.

20
00:00:37,503 --> 00:00:40,737
On the bright side, I think
I'm growing on Morgan.

21
00:00:41,972 --> 00:00:43,472
Dr. Reznick.

22
00:00:45,076 --> 00:00:46,243
Morgan.

23
00:00:47,578 --> 00:00:48,811
He doesn't need to die.

24
00:00:48,814 --> 00:00:50,012
He signed a DNR.

25
00:00:50,015 --> 00:00:51,081
He shouldn't have.

26
00:00:51,082 --> 00:00:52,314
We're gonna get his donor's marrow.

27
00:00:52,317 --> 00:00:54,084
You need surgery now.

28
00:00:54,085 --> 00:00:55,451
There's no operating room.

29
00:00:55,454 --> 00:00:57,052
We will have to improvise.

30
00:00:57,054 --> 00:00:59,125
Use your finger to plug the hole.

31
00:00:59,892 --> 00:01:01,158
Now what?

32
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:02,259
Dr. Lim?

33
00:01:04,227 --> 00:01:05,728
It's back.

34
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,509
Help my son! Help my son!

35
00:01:28,819 --> 00:01:31,555
311 bus.

36
00:01:38,329 --> 00:01:41,831
$2.35.

37
00:01:53,311 --> 00:01:55,579
Left on Blossom Hill...

38
00:01:57,348 --> 00:01:58,381
Kellan!

39
00:01:59,951 --> 00:02:02,852
Right on Cottle Street...

40
00:02:04,489 --> 00:02:05,721
Dr. Murphy?

41
00:02:05,724 --> 00:02:08,525
Left on Santa Teresa...

42
00:02:08,526 --> 00:02:11,294
I think there's something wrong with him.

43
00:02:11,295 --> 00:02:13,597
- We'll get you a mask.
- Can we get a pregnant woman a mask?

44
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:14,965
Kellan, can you hear me? Please!

45
00:02:16,033 --> 00:02:17,567
It's empty.

46
00:02:20,204 --> 00:02:21,704
Kellan!

47
00:02:21,706 --> 00:02:26,075
Right on Meridian...

48
00:02:26,078 --> 00:02:28,044
Dr. Reznick needs you.

49
00:02:28,045 --> 00:02:29,445
He's not answering.

50
00:02:29,448 --> 00:02:30,479
Dr. Murphy...

51
00:02:30,481 --> 00:02:32,581
Don't yell. It'll only make it worse.

52
00:02:32,584 --> 00:02:34,251
Okay... what should I do?

53
00:02:41,192 --> 00:02:42,491
Tell him about the surgery.

54
00:02:42,493 --> 00:02:43,893
Give him every detail you can.

55
00:02:48,066 --> 00:02:50,400
Santa Pete... has a torn IMA.

56
00:02:50,401 --> 00:02:52,201
He's hemorrhaging into his belly.

57
00:02:52,204 --> 00:02:55,271
His BP at 87 over 54 and dropping.

58
00:02:59,677 --> 00:03:03,145
A saphenous vein graft.

59
00:03:06,485 --> 00:03:12,489
We can repair the IMA with
a graft from the saphenous vein.

60
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:14,657
- We just...
- I don't need a diagnosis,

61
00:03:14,659 --> 00:03:17,159
I need an extra set of hands.

62
00:03:17,162 --> 00:03:20,096
Get me a 2-0 silk, vascular
clamps, and an 11 blade.

63
00:03:21,498 --> 00:03:22,598
Clear.

64
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:26,036
Charge to 200 joules.

65
00:03:26,038 --> 00:03:27,037
Clear!

66
00:03:33,444 --> 00:03:36,478
We just saved his life...
and violated his rights.

67
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,980
We could lose our licenses.

68
00:03:37,983 --> 00:03:40,050
You won't. You were
following instructions

69
00:03:40,051 --> 00:03:42,597
- given by an attending.
- No, I wasn't...

70
00:03:43,221 --> 00:03:45,121
Let's get him stabilized
so I can go to Andrews

71
00:03:45,122 --> 00:03:46,622
and talk to him about
getting him some marrow

72
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,258
so this wasn't a waste of time.

73
00:03:51,861 --> 00:03:53,096
Keep your lips together

74
00:03:53,098 --> 00:03:55,064
and breathe like you're
blowing out a candle.

75
00:03:55,067 --> 00:03:58,100
I c... I can't... I-I can't.

76
00:03:58,868 --> 00:04:00,736
Kel... deep breaths. Deep breaths.

77
00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:02,705
You're a doctor, right?
Any update on the virus...

78
00:04:02,707 --> 00:04:05,175
- Do I have it?
- No... no rash, no fever.

79
00:04:05,176 --> 00:04:06,109
This is your asthma...

80
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,343
When can we go home...

81
00:04:07,346 --> 00:04:08,478
Your lungs are hyper-inflated...

82
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:09,812
They better send in more doctors,

83
00:04:09,814 --> 00:04:11,213
because that weirdo melted down...

84
00:04:11,216 --> 00:04:13,694
Everybody shut up! Just shut the hell up.

85
00:04:14,118 --> 00:04:16,519
We have multiple people
in serious condition,

86
00:04:16,521 --> 00:04:19,422
including a senior doctor and my son.

87
00:04:19,423 --> 00:04:21,286
Your questions are gonna have to wait.

88
00:04:22,194 --> 00:04:23,959
I need a nebulizer.

89
00:04:23,961 --> 00:04:25,661
It's in isolation...
with the infected patients.

90
00:04:25,663 --> 00:04:27,500
I'll order one in from pharmacy...

91
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:30,100
No time.

92
00:04:32,237 --> 00:04:35,237

Making your own nebulizer?

95
00:04:44,615 --> 00:04:46,231
Something like that.

96
00:04:54,526 --> 00:04:55,692
You broke in?

97
00:04:55,694 --> 00:04:56,862
No.

98
00:04:57,629 --> 00:04:59,461
Dad... I saw the Taser.

99
00:04:59,463 --> 00:05:01,630
I didn't use it. Just threatened to...

100
00:05:01,632 --> 00:05:03,466
That was dumb.

101
00:05:03,468 --> 00:05:05,468
Long, deep breaths.

102
00:05:12,843 --> 00:05:14,377
You got her on maximal oxygen?

103
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:16,812
Yeah. Her vitals have recovered slightly.

104
00:05:16,814 --> 00:05:18,480
The CDC is sending a PCR test

105
00:05:18,483 --> 00:05:20,682
based off the virus
in the Malaysian outbreak.

106
00:05:20,685 --> 00:05:22,117
So what's their treatment protocol?

107
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,553
Antivirals, steroids,
inhaled nitric oxide

108
00:05:24,555 --> 00:05:26,889
and anti-TNF receptor antibodies.

109
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:30,560
That's what we did for
the two plane patients.

110
00:05:30,562 --> 00:05:32,862
And Tyler.

111
00:05:32,863 --> 00:05:36,199
We got to Dr. Lim sooner,
that should make a difference.

112
00:05:40,069 --> 00:05:41,637
How's Dr. Murphy?

113
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:42,838
He's fine.

114
00:05:42,841 --> 00:05:45,442
I saw his breakdown on the security feed.

115
00:05:47,511 --> 00:05:49,812
Better. He's closing on Santa Pete.

116
00:05:49,814 --> 00:05:51,613
Do you have a strategy
for dealing with him?

117
00:05:51,615 --> 00:05:53,449
- Dr. Park and I can...
- Park's in there?

118
00:05:53,451 --> 00:05:54,483
When did that happen?

119
00:05:54,485 --> 00:05:56,084
Just a few minutes ago.

120
00:05:56,086 --> 00:05:57,420
He came in to help his son.

121
00:05:59,687 --> 00:06:00,747
Perfect.

122
00:06:09,201 --> 00:06:10,934
You're still here?

123
00:06:10,935 --> 00:06:11,867
What did they say?

124
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,435
Very kind of you.

125
00:06:13,437 --> 00:06:15,704
No wonder you and Shaun
get along so well.

126
00:06:15,706 --> 00:06:17,072
What did they say?

127
00:06:17,074 --> 00:06:18,975
Did the new tests show anything new?

128
00:06:18,976 --> 00:06:22,156
They need time to process the CT images,

129
00:06:22,781 --> 00:06:24,848
send them off to Dr. Blaize.

130
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:27,817
So you might have been wrong
about your cancer coming back?

131
00:06:27,819 --> 00:06:29,122
No.

132
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,625
No?

133
00:06:32,324 --> 00:06:33,622
How can you know you're not wrong

134
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:35,757
if you don't know you're not wrong?

135
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,259
This is how they do it.

136
00:06:37,262 --> 00:06:38,927
First they tell you
there might be something,

137
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:43,500
and then they order new tests
to test the previous tests...

138
00:06:43,502 --> 00:06:47,002
only to inform you that it was
what they suspected all along.

139
00:06:47,004 --> 00:06:49,725
Very effective way of breaking bad news.

140
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:52,062
Okay...

141
00:06:52,444 --> 00:06:55,774
And if your tumor really is
back, what does that mean?

142
00:06:56,648 --> 00:06:59,716
It means that I had surgery
and let them pump radiation

143
00:06:59,718 --> 00:07:01,850
into my brain for nothing.

144
00:07:01,853 --> 00:07:05,420
It means that my memory loss
is because my brain is dying.

145
00:07:05,423 --> 00:07:10,259
It means that I probably have
a year, maybe 14 months.

146
00:07:10,262 --> 00:07:11,694
Enough meaning for you?

147
00:07:17,334 --> 00:07:19,630
What are we gonna tell Shaun?

148
00:07:20,271 --> 00:07:21,800
Nothing.

149
00:07:22,507 --> 00:07:26,175
St. Bonaventure's opened up
a room for family and friends.

150
00:07:26,177 --> 00:07:27,709
You want to come?

151
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:32,548
We expand the quarantine,
we move our marrow donor

152
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:33,816
and our patient into...

153
00:07:33,817 --> 00:07:36,019
If the donor has the virus,
his marrow will transmit it

154
00:07:36,021 --> 00:07:37,586
to your immunocompromised patient.

155
00:07:37,588 --> 00:07:38,687
He'll be dead in hours.

156
00:07:38,689 --> 00:07:40,456
As he will be without the transplant.

157
00:07:40,457 --> 00:07:42,625
We create a sterile pathway from the E.R.

158
00:07:42,627 --> 00:07:45,060
into this procedure room
using polyethylene sheeting...

159
00:07:45,062 --> 00:07:46,862
No, you won't.

160
00:07:46,865 --> 00:07:48,363
The only people taking any risks here

161
00:07:48,365 --> 00:07:49,999
are my people,
the patient, and the donor...

162
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,735
And this hospital and everyone
in it if you screw anything up.

163
00:07:52,737 --> 00:07:54,637
But my larger objection is...
it won't work.

164
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,173
That procedure room
isn't negative pressure,

165
00:07:57,175 --> 00:08:00,910
which leaves the virus free to
escape to the main vent system.

166
00:08:05,617 --> 00:08:07,584
I'll figure something else...

167
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,889
Janitors' closets.

168
00:08:16,627 --> 00:08:18,360
They're negative pressure

169
00:08:18,362 --> 00:08:20,262
because of the cleansers,
sterilizing agents.

170
00:08:20,264 --> 00:08:21,697
Don't want those odors and toxins

171
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:24,399
to disperse to patient areas.

172
00:08:24,401 --> 00:08:25,735
Here.

173
00:08:25,737 --> 00:08:27,737
That closet doesn't have
room for two patients.

174
00:08:27,738 --> 00:08:30,572
We can do the extraction there,
but not the transplant.

175
00:08:32,576 --> 00:08:34,576
We could use this linen room,
in the basement,

176
00:08:34,578 --> 00:08:36,957
which is also negative pressure

177
00:08:37,615 --> 00:08:40,316
and connects to the janitors' closet

178
00:08:40,317 --> 00:08:41,850
through this laundry chute.

179
00:08:41,852 --> 00:08:45,020
Once the bone marrow is extracted,

180
00:08:45,023 --> 00:08:48,323
it'd travel through the laundry
chute into the linen room.

181
00:08:48,326 --> 00:08:50,058
Where you could do the transplant.

182
00:08:52,596 --> 00:08:54,463
Dr. Murphy?

183
00:08:59,436 --> 00:09:01,638
Update me on patient status.

184
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:05,674
Santa Pete's vitals are stable,

185
00:09:05,677 --> 00:09:08,277
no sign of post-op infection.

186
00:09:08,278 --> 00:09:11,533
Toby is in Bay 3 receiving an IV drip;

187
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,083
Ester's ST...

188
00:09:15,086 --> 00:09:16,852
I think you're overloading him.

189
00:09:16,855 --> 00:09:18,221
No. When he's dealing with medicine,

190
00:09:18,222 --> 00:09:21,423
he's not distracted by...
everything else.

191
00:09:21,426 --> 00:09:24,192
It helps. Keep going, Shaun.

192
00:09:24,195 --> 00:09:28,664
Ester's ST depressions have improved.

193
00:09:38,243 --> 00:09:39,979
That should help, too.

194
00:09:45,548 --> 00:09:47,783
Ester's ST depressions have improved,

195
00:09:47,786 --> 00:09:49,284
and Viola's water broke.

196
00:09:49,287 --> 00:09:50,653
What? When?

197
00:09:50,654 --> 00:09:53,088
It appears quite recently.

198
00:10:05,775 --> 00:10:08,543
Aaah! Aah...

199
00:10:09,438 --> 00:10:12,240
Given you're only 36 weeks gestationally,

200
00:10:12,243 --> 00:10:13,841
and there's no sign of infection,

201
00:10:13,844 --> 00:10:15,778
the baby should be able to stay in utero

202
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:17,479
for at least 24 hours.

203
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,748
If the quarantine is done before...

204
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,451
You're not gonna fall apart
again, are you?

205
00:10:25,389 --> 00:10:28,990
I don't think so, Viola.

206
00:10:28,993 --> 00:10:32,193
The buzzing is gone,
and there is much less yelling.

207
00:10:32,196 --> 00:10:33,828
Except you.

208
00:10:33,831 --> 00:10:35,931
It was the buzzing and the yelling,

209
00:10:35,932 --> 00:10:37,932
not the fact that we're
trapped with three people

210
00:10:37,934 --> 00:10:39,701
who have died from
a highly infectious disease?

211
00:10:39,703 --> 00:10:42,236
That's not something to worry about.

212
00:10:42,239 --> 00:10:44,740
I either have the virus or I don't,

213
00:10:44,741 --> 00:10:48,476
and, based on past national
quarantine mortality rates,

214
00:10:48,479 --> 00:10:51,759
we have a very good statistical
chance of surviving.

215
00:10:54,183 --> 00:10:58,354
But I didn't know that I would
"fall apart" the first time,

216
00:10:58,355 --> 00:10:59,955
so I may be wrong.

217
00:10:59,956 --> 00:11:02,390
Here you go.

218
00:11:05,227 --> 00:11:07,129
You always talk like that?

219
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:08,797
Like what?

220
00:11:08,798 --> 00:11:10,932
Just say whatever you're thinking

221
00:11:10,934 --> 00:11:12,967
when you're thinking it?

222
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:15,991
Yes. It's good to be honest.

223
00:11:17,539 --> 00:11:19,707
Wish my dad was like that.

224
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:23,445
Dr. Park is very honest.
He always shares his opinions.

225
00:11:23,447 --> 00:11:26,192
There's opinions.
And then there's feelings.

226
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:30,298
Your dad doesn't tell you
that he loves you?

227
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,855
What?

228
00:11:34,256 --> 00:11:38,860
Well, he's just...
not really there for us.

229
00:11:41,998 --> 00:11:45,734
He did just risk his life,
and his career,

230
00:11:45,735 --> 00:11:47,961
to break into a quarantine to help you.

231
00:11:48,722 --> 00:11:50,438
That's true.

232
00:11:50,441 --> 00:11:52,607
But most kids want their dad there

233
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:55,076
even when it's not life and death.

234
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:16,565
Sorry for your loss.

235
00:12:25,674 --> 00:12:27,241
Status?

236
00:12:27,244 --> 00:12:29,076
O2 SAT is 92,

237
00:12:29,078 --> 00:12:31,400
respiratory rate is down to 16.

238
00:12:31,981 --> 00:12:33,782
Your lungs sound clearer.

239
00:12:33,783 --> 00:12:35,683
Keep pulmonary edema to a minimum

240
00:12:35,686 --> 00:12:37,985
with conservative fluid management.

241
00:12:37,988 --> 00:12:41,023
Use furosemide so my CVP's under 8.

242
00:12:41,024 --> 00:12:42,691
Absolutely.

243
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,200
I love this place.

244
00:12:55,938 --> 00:12:59,475
I always said I'd be doing this
'til the day I died.

245
00:12:59,476 --> 00:13:01,844
Ta-da.

246
00:13:01,846 --> 00:13:04,580
We started your treatment early.

247
00:13:04,581 --> 00:13:06,815
You'll be back to repairing
late-night, drunken head injuries

248
00:13:06,817 --> 00:13:08,115
in no time.

249
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:13,317
I forgot to call my mom on her birthday.

250
00:13:14,924 --> 00:13:17,091
I forgot to do a lot of stuff...

251
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:22,409
Tyler was sweet.

252
00:13:22,866 --> 00:13:24,298
He was a good guy.

253
00:13:27,135 --> 00:13:30,639
Best to put him out of sight.

254
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:35,177
It's not a healthy reminder...
for either of us.

255
00:14:00,671 --> 00:14:02,370
Tyler's mask had a tear in it.

256
00:14:02,373 --> 00:14:04,306
It's possible the virus is droplet-based,

257
00:14:04,307 --> 00:14:05,606
not airborne.

258
00:14:05,609 --> 00:14:07,942
Blood or saliva could've made
its way through his mask

259
00:14:07,945 --> 00:14:09,745
from the airline passengers.

260
00:14:09,746 --> 00:14:11,547
Unfortunately, until we know for sure,

261
00:14:11,548 --> 00:14:14,336
we're still on lockdown.

262
00:14:14,851 --> 00:14:16,884
But I'll let the CDC know.

263
00:14:21,325 --> 00:14:22,890
Do you have a minute?

264
00:14:22,893 --> 00:14:24,259
Is it urgent?

265
00:14:26,162 --> 00:14:27,428
Not really.

266
00:14:31,366 --> 00:14:32,855
Kel...

267
00:14:33,636 --> 00:14:35,102
What's up?

268
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,942
Why'd you move away?

269
00:14:39,943 --> 00:14:42,344
I'm a resident, you go
where the job takes you.

270
00:14:42,346 --> 00:14:44,779
They don't need doctors in Phoenix?

271
00:14:44,782 --> 00:14:47,081
This was an excellent opportunity for me.

272
00:14:47,084 --> 00:14:48,616
And it's less than
a two-hour flight; I'm not...

273
00:14:48,619 --> 00:14:51,581
You had my baseball schedule for months

274
00:14:52,188 --> 00:14:53,754
and you came for one game

275
00:14:53,756 --> 00:14:56,758
and you were on your computer
the entire time.

276
00:14:56,759 --> 00:14:59,193
I had exams the next day.

277
00:14:59,196 --> 00:15:01,062
So why'd you bother coming?

278
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,945
Mm, good...

279
00:15:16,947 --> 00:15:18,080
Slowly...

280
00:15:18,081 --> 00:15:19,648
Good...

281
00:15:19,649 --> 00:15:22,750
As delicious as these ice chips are,

282
00:15:22,753 --> 00:15:24,885
I think I'm ready for some solid food;

283
00:15:24,888 --> 00:15:26,621
did they send in any cookies?

284
00:15:26,624 --> 00:15:30,292
Dr. Murphy was very clear...
no food until you fart.

285
00:15:31,695 --> 00:15:35,998
Just imagine they're straight
from the North Pole.

286
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,533
- Bob, you ready?
- Of course.

287
00:15:39,536 --> 00:15:41,036
I'm doing a bone marrow extraction,

288
00:15:41,038 --> 00:15:43,838
and I need an extra set of hands
to handle some bloody stuff...

289
00:15:43,841 --> 00:15:46,307
separating bone and fat from stem cells.

290
00:15:46,309 --> 00:15:48,610
Who here isn't freaked out by
what I just said and can help?

291
00:15:48,611 --> 00:15:50,600
Ester's a doctor.

292
00:15:51,514 --> 00:15:52,648
You're a doctor? Why haven't you...

293
00:15:52,649 --> 00:15:54,282
Veterinarian. Retired.

294
00:15:54,283 --> 00:15:55,716
Blood is blood. Follow us.

295
00:16:00,691 --> 00:16:05,192
Fetal heart rate is still
between 130 and 140 BPM.

296
00:16:05,195 --> 00:16:06,995
Contractions 17 minutes apart.

297
00:16:06,996 --> 00:16:08,062
What's happening? Is it my baby?

298
00:16:08,065 --> 00:16:10,798
Viola's BP is 180 over 100.

299
00:16:10,801 --> 00:16:14,568
She may have preeclampsia
and an oncoming seizure.

300
00:16:14,571 --> 00:16:16,038
We need to induce labor.

301
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:18,173
No. He's not being born in here.

302
00:16:18,174 --> 00:16:19,607
We are waiting for quarantine to end.

303
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:21,475
Your placenta isn't getting
enough blood flow.

304
00:16:21,477 --> 00:16:23,378
We need to get him out.

305
00:16:23,379 --> 00:16:26,847
This is going to be your first baby.

306
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:28,517
And mine.

307
00:16:32,789 --> 00:16:34,588
Start bronchodilators.

308
00:16:34,591 --> 00:16:36,057
Dr. Lim... can you hear me?

309
00:16:38,061 --> 00:16:40,162
O2 SATs are still dropping.

310
00:16:44,167 --> 00:16:45,966
Push paralytics.

311
00:16:45,969 --> 00:16:47,668
Starting intubation.

312
00:16:52,221 --> 00:16:53,721
I'm getting resistance bagging.

313
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:55,706
I gave her hyoscine.

314
00:16:57,332 --> 00:16:59,594
Hello? What's going on?

315
00:17:00,383 --> 00:17:01,816
What's going on?

316
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,688
Lim's O2 SATs are crashing.
Her lungs aren't inflating.

317
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,990
They're filled with fluid and secretions.

318
00:17:06,991 --> 00:17:09,058
- Pick up the phone.
- I've got my hands full.

319
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,180
Villanueva, pick up the phone.

320
00:17:12,196 --> 00:17:14,698
Okay, show me what's going on.

321
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,432
She's in full respiratory failure.

322
00:17:16,434 --> 00:17:18,201
She needs more pulmonary support.

323
00:17:18,202 --> 00:17:20,737
Get her on BiPAP.
That might buy us some time.

324
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:22,571
Or we take her lungs out of the equation.

325
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:23,707
We put her on ECMO,

326
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,076
oxygenate her blood outside her body...

327
00:17:26,077 --> 00:17:27,277
her lungs will have time to heal.

328
00:17:27,278 --> 00:17:28,711
We can't do ECMO in the E.R.

329
00:17:28,713 --> 00:17:30,079
We aren't supposed to do
abdominal surgery

330
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:31,381
in the E.R., either.

331
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,383
Please, walk me through it.

332
00:17:36,921 --> 00:17:38,421
Prep an area over her femoral vein.

333
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:45,761
That's very loud.

334
00:17:45,763 --> 00:17:47,029
Any crowning, Dr. Murphy?

335
00:17:47,031 --> 00:17:50,534
No, she's dilated at 6 centimeters,

336
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:51,768
and I don't feel the head.

337
00:17:51,769 --> 00:17:53,170
It's been seven hours
since her water broke.

338
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:54,837
The baby's stuck. Use Leopold's maneuvers

339
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:56,640
to identify the location of the baby.

340
00:18:03,614 --> 00:18:05,448
The fetus is transverse.

341
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:08,852
He's lying roughly thirty
degrees to the left side.

342
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:10,287
We can't deliver the baby.

343
00:18:10,288 --> 00:18:11,488
What?! Why not?

344
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:12,689
We need to turn the baby.

345
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:14,423
We need to do an external
cephalic version.

346
00:18:14,425 --> 00:18:16,425
Or a C-section.

347
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:17,894
I have assisted on several...

348
00:18:17,895 --> 00:18:20,063
In operating rooms with
an experienced attending.

349
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:22,398
We are not doing a C-section here.

350
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:24,233
Tilt her bed. I'll grab the gel.

351
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:26,435
- Mm.
- Okay.

352
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:40,650
So when...?

353
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:43,586
What? When what?

354
00:18:43,588 --> 00:18:45,555
I get not telling him
when he's in quarantine.

355
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:47,022
He's got enough on his plate, but...

356
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:48,486
Never.

357
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:51,894
You told him when you
were first diagnosed.

358
00:18:51,896 --> 00:18:54,197
Yes, and that was a mistake.

359
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:57,661
He forced you take tests
that saved your life.

360
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:01,003
Well, no, as it turns out, it didn't.

361
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:03,272
And he became so obsessed and distracted

362
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:05,877
that he nearly killed a patient.

363
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,911
He's your friend.

364
00:19:10,181 --> 00:19:14,183
I'm his mentor. It's not
his job to take care of me.

365
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,968
Make sure you turn the needle so
you're getting marrow from all sides.

366
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:40,042
Aspirate slower.

367
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:41,744
If you pull fast, it's more painful.

368
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:43,380
Hang in there, Bob.

369
00:19:47,018 --> 00:19:49,184
I deserve a little pain.

370
00:19:49,186 --> 00:19:52,221
You're his dad. You're saving his life.

371
00:19:52,223 --> 00:19:55,802
I took off before my son
even knew who I was,

372
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:58,894
traveled in crappy vans

373
00:19:58,896 --> 00:20:01,897
to s-stay at crappy hotels

374
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,811
and play crappy music,

375
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:07,938
all so I could earn enough to get high.

376
00:20:10,074 --> 00:20:11,775
You're here now.

377
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:14,529
By the time I got up
the nerve to face them,

378
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,414
my ex was dying.

379
00:20:20,151 --> 00:20:23,019
God willing I did it in time
to save my son.

380
00:20:29,026 --> 00:20:31,627
Dr. Melendez, Chris's
vitals are bottoming out.

381
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,229
His secretions and lung sounds are worse.

382
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:35,298
I don't know how much longer we can wait.

383
00:20:35,299 --> 00:20:37,185
Administer Levophed,
and prep him for transplant.

384
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,804
Dr. Park, Chris's in hypotensive crisis.

385
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:43,405
- Go faster!
- Fast as I can.

386
00:20:45,943 --> 00:20:47,176
You ready, Dr. Murphy?

387
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:49,244
Yes. I can feel the head.

388
00:20:49,247 --> 00:20:52,115
We need to rotate in the same direction.

389
00:20:52,116 --> 00:20:53,516
Deep breaths, Viola.

390
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:54,917
Okay.

391
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,253
Oh, I can't... I can't do this!

392
00:20:58,256 --> 00:21:00,356
Squeeze my arm hard as you can.

393
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:05,461
The fetus is moving.

394
00:21:05,463 --> 00:21:07,529
The head is facing the cervix.

395
00:21:07,531 --> 00:21:08,932
One more push.

396
00:21:08,933 --> 00:21:10,532
- We just need...
- Stop!

397
00:21:11,868 --> 00:21:13,502
Placental abruption.

398
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:14,871
She's hemorrhaging.

399
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:17,906
Baby's heart rate is decelerating.

400
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:21,644
I need 2 large-bore I.V. lines
and start 2 units PRBC.

401
00:21:21,645 --> 00:21:26,249
Then please page an OB-GYN to
supervise my first solo surgery.

402
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:46,403
This is terrible.

403
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:48,272
This is not how it's supposed to...

404
00:21:48,275 --> 00:21:49,740
This is excellent.

405
00:21:49,742 --> 00:21:53,345
Dr. Garcia will be supervising
me for the C-section.

406
00:21:53,346 --> 00:21:56,681
She's the director of Obstetrics
and Gynecology here.

407
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:58,282
I'm sure she's much more qualified

408
00:21:58,285 --> 00:22:00,285
than your personal OB-GYN.

409
00:22:00,287 --> 00:22:02,420
Relax. You're gonna be fine.
What's the status?

410
00:22:02,422 --> 00:22:05,757
Nerve block is in, and I gave
her a liter bolus of saline.

411
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:07,125
Throw some ChloraPrep down

412
00:22:07,126 --> 00:22:10,095
and make a five centimeter
Pfannenstiel incision.

413
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:18,936
Ten-blade.

414
00:22:56,009 --> 00:22:57,741
Chris's prepped.

415
00:22:57,743 --> 00:22:59,911
Inserting central line now.

416
00:22:59,913 --> 00:23:01,613
How's he doing?

417
00:23:01,615 --> 00:23:04,682
Pressure is 90 over 50, O2 SATs are 85,

418
00:23:04,684 --> 00:23:06,961
heart rate is at 110.

419
00:23:06,962 --> 00:23:09,153
Ready when you are.

420
00:23:10,423 --> 00:23:11,623
One more and we're good to go.

421
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:13,958
I'm on my way.

422
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,492
I'm scrubbing in. Call me the second

423
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:17,295
you're ready for the drop.

424
00:23:20,834 --> 00:23:23,268
Abdomen is open. Retraction.

425
00:23:24,875 --> 00:23:26,430
Suction.

426
00:23:28,775 --> 00:23:30,866
Baby's BPM is 110 and dropping.

427
00:23:30,868 --> 00:23:32,162
What's happening?

428
00:23:32,163 --> 00:23:34,897
Dr. Murphy, do you see the uterine wall?

429
00:23:35,967 --> 00:23:37,165
Blood pressure is dropping.

430
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:39,067
Dr. Murphy, the uterine wall.

431
00:23:39,069 --> 00:23:40,369
Dr. Murphy?

432
00:23:40,372 --> 00:23:42,204
You need to make a gradual
shallow incision

433
00:23:42,207 --> 00:23:43,239
and cut through it.

434
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,641
You do not want to nick the baby.

435
00:23:44,643 --> 00:23:46,675
- What's happening?
- BPM is 95.

436
00:23:46,677 --> 00:23:48,278
Dr. Murphy, please!

437
00:23:48,279 --> 00:23:49,612
Dr. Murphy, should we turn up her oxygen?

438
00:23:49,614 --> 00:23:50,846
Dr. Murphy, you need to make the cut.

439
00:23:50,848 --> 00:23:52,448
Dr. Murphy. Dr. Murphy.

440
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:55,785
- Dr. Murphy.
- Dr. Murphy.

441
00:23:55,787 --> 00:23:57,953
No!

442
00:23:57,955 --> 00:23:59,622
Quiet! Everyone quiet!

443
00:23:59,624 --> 00:24:01,590
I need to concentrate!

444
00:24:15,373 --> 00:24:16,605
I can see the head.

445
00:24:21,512 --> 00:24:23,112
Is my baby okay?

446
00:24:23,114 --> 00:24:25,647
He's not breathing.
We need to start CPR now.

447
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:26,915
Get a pediatric Ambu-bag

448
00:24:26,917 --> 00:24:29,218
and start two-finger chest compressions.

449
00:24:35,926 --> 00:24:37,626
There's something wrong with Viola.

450
00:24:37,628 --> 00:24:39,828
She's hypotensive and tachycardic.

451
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:41,631
She's bleeding out.

452
00:25:00,951 --> 00:25:02,986
You should tell him.

453
00:25:02,988 --> 00:25:05,054
Look at that. Another reason why you two

454
00:25:05,056 --> 00:25:07,356
are so good together.

455
00:25:07,358 --> 00:25:09,759
Neither one of you are willing
to drop a thing.

456
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,760
He deserves to know.

457
00:25:11,762 --> 00:25:13,028
Deserves?

458
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:14,864
Is that how things work in your world?

459
00:25:14,865 --> 00:25:16,566
People get what they deserve?

460
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,103
Shaun deserves to be toyed with?

461
00:25:20,105 --> 00:25:22,336
- Who's toying with him?
- You.

462
00:25:22,874 --> 00:25:24,307
I'm his friend.

463
00:25:24,308 --> 00:25:26,009
You whisk him away on a road trip,

464
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:28,810
kiss him and then leave town.

465
00:25:28,813 --> 00:25:31,814
Now you pop back into his life,
move in with him.

466
00:25:31,816 --> 00:25:33,950
Shaun's not some hamster
you get to play with

467
00:25:33,951 --> 00:25:37,153
and then not think twice about
it when you forget to feed him.

468
00:25:37,154 --> 00:25:39,388
You're gonna hurt him again.
You know that.

469
00:25:39,391 --> 00:25:40,522
I know that.

470
00:25:43,794 --> 00:25:46,996
I'm gonna let that slide
because you're dying.

471
00:25:52,469 --> 00:25:54,302
I'm gonna take this outside.

472
00:26:04,382 --> 00:26:05,847
Bubble wrap?

473
00:26:05,849 --> 00:26:08,183
Need to make sure it
doesn't break on the trip.

474
00:26:08,185 --> 00:26:10,118
Or the landing.

475
00:26:10,121 --> 00:26:12,587
Dr. Melendez, we're ready.

476
00:26:12,589 --> 00:26:14,891
Copy. Deposit the marrow now.

477
00:26:28,906 --> 00:26:30,940
The marrow is intact.

478
00:26:30,942 --> 00:26:32,174
We're good to go.

479
00:26:38,615 --> 00:26:41,784
My chest...

480
00:26:41,786 --> 00:26:43,952
It really hurts.

481
00:26:43,954 --> 00:26:45,488
He's going into cardiac arrest.

482
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:47,355
- What can I do?
- His I.V. is blown.

483
00:26:48,592 --> 00:26:49,726
The tip broke off.

484
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:51,227
It must be in his heart.

485
00:26:53,396 --> 00:26:54,997
Come on.

486
00:26:54,999 --> 00:26:57,333
Dr. Murphy, the rules
of medical priority are clear.

487
00:26:57,335 --> 00:26:59,034
Focus on saving the mother.

488
00:27:00,038 --> 00:27:02,805
Dr. Murphy, you need to stop now.

489
00:27:02,807 --> 00:27:04,480
Dr. Murphy.

490
00:27:05,242 --> 00:27:06,509
Dr. Murphy?

491
00:27:08,412 --> 00:27:10,946
We can save them both.

492
00:27:10,949 --> 00:27:13,082
Get me a liter of saline, a plastic bag,

493
00:27:13,084 --> 00:27:15,484
some surgical tape
and Kerlix gauze, please.

494
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:20,413
Who knows CPR?

495
00:27:21,259 --> 00:27:23,492
Who knows CPR?

496
00:27:23,494 --> 00:27:25,560
- Um, in Health, they ma...
- Come with me.

497
00:27:25,563 --> 00:27:28,064
Okay, two fingers right here
in the middle of his chest.

498
00:27:28,066 --> 00:27:29,265
Press down twice per second,

499
00:27:29,267 --> 00:27:31,834
every fifteen seconds,
stop and squeeze the bag.

500
00:27:31,836 --> 00:27:33,236
Twice... Yes, don't press too hard,

501
00:27:33,238 --> 00:27:35,010
or you'll crush his heart.

502
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,721
Okay.

503
00:27:50,164 --> 00:27:53,133
You're making a Bakri tamponade
balloon for Viola's bleed?

504
00:27:53,134 --> 00:27:55,101
- Yes.
- What is that supposed to do?

505
00:27:55,103 --> 00:27:57,237
It will control the bleeding
by applying pressure

506
00:27:57,239 --> 00:27:59,105
- from the inside.
- How's the baby?

507
00:27:59,106 --> 00:28:00,272
I don't know if this is working.

508
00:28:00,275 --> 00:28:01,708
- I just...
- Don't stop.

509
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:03,242
Are you ready, Dr. Murphy?

510
00:28:03,244 --> 00:28:05,679
Feed the end of the pack
slowly through her cervix.

511
00:28:05,681 --> 00:28:08,748
Once you reach the fundus of
the uterus, start inflation.

512
00:28:12,386 --> 00:28:13,353
Clear.

513
00:28:14,556 --> 00:28:16,189
- That's the fourth one.
- I have to crack his chest.

514
00:28:16,191 --> 00:28:17,356
- Here?
- Get me rib spreaders

515
00:28:17,358 --> 00:28:19,259
and a ten blade from the crash cart.

516
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,167
Marrow's in.

517
00:28:30,905 --> 00:28:34,641
Heart rate's 84, BP's 100 over 60...

518
00:28:34,643 --> 00:28:36,175
vitals look good.

519
00:28:46,753 --> 00:28:48,822
I'm sorry about before.

520
00:28:53,861 --> 00:28:57,009
Are you gonna tell Shaun
you got some good news?

521
00:28:57,566 --> 00:28:59,231
What makes you think it's good news?

522
00:28:59,233 --> 00:29:01,401
Because you apologized.

523
00:29:02,803 --> 00:29:04,537
The cancer's not back.

524
00:29:04,538 --> 00:29:06,506
- That's great.
- It's not great.

525
00:29:06,508 --> 00:29:08,540
It's okay. It's not great.

526
00:29:08,542 --> 00:29:11,176
I have meningitis from
a CSF leak in my head.

527
00:29:11,179 --> 00:29:14,381
I have to have surgery
pretty much immediately.

528
00:29:14,383 --> 00:29:16,516
And, no, I am not telling Shaun.

529
00:29:17,884 --> 00:29:19,251
You're right about one thing.

530
00:29:19,253 --> 00:29:20,286
You're not his friend.

531
00:29:20,288 --> 00:29:22,188
Because friends tell
each other everything.

532
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:24,089
And you're a lousy mentor.

533
00:29:24,092 --> 00:29:26,092
Friends are there for each
other, and mentors teach.

534
00:29:26,094 --> 00:29:27,594
They don't hide the truth.

535
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:31,865
I'm just looking out for him.

536
00:29:31,866 --> 00:29:33,732
He's not like you. He's not
like everybody el...

537
00:29:33,734 --> 00:29:34,901
No, he's not,

538
00:29:34,903 --> 00:29:37,369
but he's also not some helpless child

539
00:29:37,372 --> 00:29:39,239
who constantly needs protection.

540
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,507
He's an adult;

541
00:29:40,509 --> 00:29:43,710
a very smart, caring adult.

542
00:29:43,711 --> 00:29:47,227
And you could really use
someone like that right now.

543
00:29:58,059 --> 00:29:59,992
It's not working. She's still bleeding.

544
00:29:59,994 --> 00:30:02,095
Keep injecting saline.

545
00:30:11,373 --> 00:30:13,605
Vitals are 80 over 60. Heart rate's 110.

546
00:30:13,607 --> 00:30:14,907
Stop CPR.

547
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:17,464
I need to see if he can
breathe on his own.

548
00:30:22,049 --> 00:30:23,516
Is everything okay?

549
00:30:23,518 --> 00:30:25,484
No. His lungs are filled with fluid.

550
00:30:25,487 --> 00:30:26,618
He's drowning.

551
00:30:26,621 --> 00:30:28,755
Get the pediatric laryngoscope stat.

552
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,692
Dr. Andrews, she's still...

553
00:30:33,694 --> 00:30:35,828
It's not Andrews.

554
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:37,663
Can I see her?

555
00:30:38,699 --> 00:30:40,599
Map is holding steady at 65,

556
00:30:40,602 --> 00:30:44,304
but she was dipping into serious
hypoxia for a short bit.

557
00:30:44,306 --> 00:30:46,172
Can I see her?

558
00:31:00,653 --> 00:31:03,690
Good work, taking care of her.

559
00:31:03,692 --> 00:31:05,290
Thank you.

560
00:31:16,703 --> 00:31:18,904
The baby has meconium aspiration.

561
00:31:18,906 --> 00:31:19,939
Suction catheter.

562
00:31:19,941 --> 00:31:21,240
Is that bad?

563
00:31:21,242 --> 00:31:22,808
Fecal matter has settled in his lungs.

564
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:24,109
It's blocking his airway.

565
00:31:24,112 --> 00:31:25,144
Did I do something wrong?

566
00:31:25,146 --> 00:31:26,546
You most likely dislodged some of it.

567
00:31:26,548 --> 00:31:29,015
Without that, he would've
suffocated by now.

568
00:31:29,017 --> 00:31:30,784
Clearing his airway.

569
00:31:33,788 --> 00:31:36,627
It's the most important
moment of my life.

570
00:31:37,358 --> 00:31:39,259
And I'm not there with Viola.

571
00:31:40,994 --> 00:31:43,163
This is the way it used to be done.

572
00:31:43,164 --> 00:31:45,131
The men waiting outside.

573
00:31:46,534 --> 00:31:48,601
Now we know better.

574
00:31:48,603 --> 00:31:52,172
Now we know it matters.

575
00:31:52,173 --> 00:31:54,540
Do you think your grandfather
loved your father

576
00:31:54,542 --> 00:31:57,042
- any less just beca...
- Shut up.

577
00:31:57,045 --> 00:31:58,744
Ignore him. He's just a grouch.

578
00:31:58,747 --> 00:32:00,712
Shh.

579
00:32:06,019 --> 00:32:07,386
Is that...?

580
00:32:11,425 --> 00:32:13,692
I think you've got yourself
a new alarm clock.

581
00:32:15,329 --> 00:32:17,029
Congratulations!

582
00:32:19,835 --> 00:32:21,433
Congratulations.

583
00:32:23,237 --> 00:32:25,571
I'm a dad.

584
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:44,457
He is okay.

585
00:32:49,395 --> 00:32:51,263
A Christmas miracle.

586
00:32:57,239 --> 00:32:58,872
Thank you.

587
00:33:00,541 --> 00:33:01,875
It's Lim.

588
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:10,950
Could I get some water?

589
00:33:17,692 --> 00:33:19,392
ECMO?

590
00:33:19,394 --> 00:33:20,926
That was a ballsy move.

591
00:33:37,826 --> 00:33:41,894
Ester Blum, Pete Bailey...

592
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:45,664
your PCR and serology came
back negative for the virus.

593
00:33:45,666 --> 00:33:47,333
You're officially cleared.

594
00:33:47,335 --> 00:33:48,667
We're going home.

595
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:50,603
Only Ester can go home.

596
00:33:50,605 --> 00:33:53,573
You're going to post-op
recovery for another day.

597
00:33:55,409 --> 00:33:57,175
I'll keep you company.

598
00:33:57,177 --> 00:33:59,912
There's someone I want
to see up there anyway.

599
00:34:03,951 --> 00:34:06,085
On Dasher, on Dancer,

600
00:34:06,086 --> 00:34:07,920
on Prancer and Vixen.

601
00:34:14,094 --> 00:34:16,496
You are stable;

602
00:34:16,498 --> 00:34:18,998
no sign of marrow rejection.

603
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,934
We will be monitoring you
over the next few weeks,

604
00:34:21,936 --> 00:34:25,670
but remission is a very real possibility.

605
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,132
I don't know how to thank you enough.

606
00:34:29,978 --> 00:34:31,943
Guess I should thank my dad too.

607
00:34:31,945 --> 00:34:33,146
Is he here?

608
00:34:36,048 --> 00:34:39,585
There was a complication
during extraction.

609
00:34:39,586 --> 00:34:41,228
Bob's heart stopped.

610
00:34:41,922 --> 00:34:44,456
And we did everything
we could to revive him,

611
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:47,059
but he died.

612
00:34:48,996 --> 00:34:49,996
What?

613
00:34:53,099 --> 00:34:55,601
We're so sorry for your loss.

614
00:34:58,472 --> 00:34:59,871
Are you Chris Santos?

615
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:04,710
My name is Ester.

616
00:35:07,681 --> 00:35:09,949
I was with your father when he...

617
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:15,762
He mentioned that he had lot of regrets.

618
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:21,427
But it meant a lot to him
that he could help you.

619
00:35:38,978 --> 00:35:41,947
Heard you were a big help
during that delivery.

620
00:35:41,949 --> 00:35:43,815
They needed extra hands.

621
00:35:55,528 --> 00:36:00,682
You asked me why I let
you and your mom go,

622
00:36:01,536 --> 00:36:03,402
why I didn't fight harder.

623
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:12,744
It's because I wasn't a good person.

624
00:36:13,914 --> 00:36:15,715
I wasn't a good father.

625
00:36:20,686 --> 00:36:24,389
My dad had this mantra...

626
00:36:24,391 --> 00:36:26,826
Be like stone; never cry.

627
00:36:28,661 --> 00:36:34,000
If I got emotional or upset...
he'd repeat it:

628
00:36:34,001 --> 00:36:37,202
be like stone; never cry.

629
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:41,306
It made me stronger...

630
00:36:41,309 --> 00:36:43,643
which wasn't always a good thing.

631
00:36:44,378 --> 00:36:47,512
Spent my life living behind a wall...

632
00:36:47,514 --> 00:36:49,949
which meant your mom got
to live with that wall

633
00:36:49,951 --> 00:36:52,518
as well, and...

634
00:36:55,755 --> 00:37:01,059
When we split up, I felt like a failure.

635
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:08,601
Moving away helped me hide from that.

636
00:37:12,806 --> 00:37:15,842
My father's voice is still in my head.

637
00:37:16,643 --> 00:37:20,246
But I'm working on
getting it to be quiet.

638
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:26,284
I love you, Kellan.

639
00:37:28,521 --> 00:37:30,422
Always will.

640
00:38:58,978 --> 00:39:00,880
Kellan!

641
00:39:00,882 --> 00:39:02,313
Mom!

642
00:39:05,943 --> 00:39:07,085
Are you okay?

643
00:39:07,088 --> 00:39:08,487
I'm fine. I, uh...

644
00:39:08,489 --> 00:39:09,989
I helped deliver a baby.

645
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:11,923
Oh.

646
00:39:11,925 --> 00:39:13,492
He was amazing.

647
00:39:16,996 --> 00:39:18,630
It's good to see you, Mia.

648
00:39:18,632 --> 00:39:20,166
How was it in there?

649
00:39:23,503 --> 00:39:26,338
The guy I worked on didn't make it.

650
00:39:56,902 --> 00:39:58,628
Merry Christmas.

651
00:39:59,273 --> 00:40:01,340
I don't think I'll forget this one.

652
00:40:06,213 --> 00:40:07,972
Me neither.

653
00:40:08,983 --> 00:40:11,266
The idea of you not being around...

654
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:14,052
wasn't okay with me.

655
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:18,257
Who would I drink bourbon with?

656
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:23,496
I think my bourbon days are
behind me for a little while.

657
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:27,932
I'll wait.

658
00:40:35,074 --> 00:40:36,375
Shaun!

659
00:40:36,376 --> 00:40:37,409
Hi.

660
00:40:39,545 --> 00:40:41,880
You must be exhausted.

661
00:40:41,882 --> 00:40:43,481
And hungry.

662
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:46,018
All the sandwiches they gave us
had pickles in them.

663
00:40:46,019 --> 00:40:47,637
Oh, that's no good.

664
00:40:48,255 --> 00:40:50,655
How about we go to that
24-hour breakfast place

665
00:40:50,657 --> 00:40:52,358
and get some pancakes?

666
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:55,027
I would like that very much.

667
00:40:55,028 --> 00:40:57,262
- Hello, Dr. Glassman.
- Hello.

668
00:40:57,264 --> 00:40:59,764
- I delivered a baby.
- Yes, we heard.

669
00:40:59,766 --> 00:41:02,333
I'm sorry I couldn't drive you
to your appointment.

670
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:03,802
How did it go?

671
00:41:07,574 --> 00:41:08,907
I have meningitis.

672
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:14,045
I have to have surgery later today

673
00:41:14,047 --> 00:41:17,083
to fix the CSF leak in my head.

674
00:41:18,251 --> 00:41:19,952
I thought you should know.

675
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:26,257
That's good.

676
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:29,128
Meningitis is definitely
not as bad as cancer.

677
00:41:29,739 --> 00:41:33,532
It also explains your memory loss.

678
00:41:33,534 --> 00:41:36,268
Now you can get your license back.

679
00:41:37,003 --> 00:41:40,739
Shaun, would you mind
if Glassy gave you a hug?

680
00:41:43,809 --> 00:41:45,744
I think that would be very nice.

681
00:41:54,255 --> 00:41:55,954
Very proud of you.
