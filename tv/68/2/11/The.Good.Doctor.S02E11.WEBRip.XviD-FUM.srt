back, what does that mean?

167
00:06:57,384 --> 00:07:00,521
It means that I had surgery
and let them pump radiation

168
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:02,756
into my brain for nothing.

169
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:06,494
It means that my memory loss
is because my brain is dying.

170
00:07:06,527 --> 00:07:10,197
It means that I probably have
a year, maybe 14 months.

171
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:12,700
Enough meaning for you?

173
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,873
What are we gonna
tell Shaun?

174
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:23,343
Nothing.

175
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:26,413
St Bonaventure's opened up
a room for family and friends.

176
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,081
You want to come?

177
00:07:31,084 --> 00:07:32,452
We expand the quarantine.

178
00:07:32,486 --> 00:07:34,421
We move our marrow donor
and our patient...

179
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,890
If the donor has the virus,
his marrow will transmit it

180
00:07:36,924 --> 00:07:37,958
to your
immunocompromised patient.

181
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:39,259
He'll be dead in hours.

182
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,361
As he will be without
the transplant.

183
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:43,731
We create a sterile pathway
from the ER

184
00:07:43,764 --> 00:07:45,866
into this procedure room
using polyethylene sheeting...

185
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:47,868
No, you won't.

186
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:49,402
The only people
taking any risks here

187
00:07:49,436 --> 00:07:50,771
are my people,
the patient, and the donor.

188
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,773
And this hospital
and everyone in it

189
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:53,874
if you screw anything up.

190
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:55,709
But my larger objection is
it won't work.

191
00:07:55,743 --> 00:07:58,946
That procedure room
isn't negative pressure,
which leaves the virus free

192
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,481
to escape
to the main vent system.

193
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,355
I'll figure something else.

194
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:13,260
Janitors' closets.

195
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:19,667
They're negative pressure

196
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,334
because of the cleansers,
sterilizing agents.

197
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:22,903
Don't want those odors
and toxins

198
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:24,672
to disperse
to patient areas.

199
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:26,740
Here.

200
00:08:26,774 --> 00:08:28,676
That closet doesn't have
room for two patients.

201
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:30,878
We can do the extraction there
but not the transplant.

202
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:35,616
We could use this linen room
in the basement,

203
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:38,118
which is also
negative pressure

204
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:41,254
and connects
to the janitors' closet

205
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:42,355
through this laundry chute.

206
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:44,892
Once the bone marrow
is extracted,

207
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,728
it'd travel through
the laundry chute

208
00:08:47,761 --> 00:08:49,129
into the linen room

209
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:50,864
where you could do
the transplant.

DR PARK: I think you're
overloading him.

217
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,159
No. When he's dealing
with medicine,

218
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:22,395
he's not distracted by
everything else.

219
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:25,065
It helps.
Keep going, Shaun.

That's not something
to worry about.

I either have the virus
or I don't,
