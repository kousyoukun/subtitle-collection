<i>Previously on "The Good Doctor"...</i>

2
00:00:02,288 --> 00:00:05,189
Coming back to California
and moving in with you...

3
00:00:05,214 --> 00:00:07,848
it's been harder than I anticipated.

4
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:10,250
Hershey meant everything to me, Shaun.

5
00:00:10,252 --> 00:00:12,953
I took the biggest chance
of my life going back there.

6
00:00:12,955 --> 00:00:14,688
And then it just went away.

7
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:16,056
Deep brain stimulation

8
00:00:16,058 --> 00:00:17,624
was used to treat anorexia.

9
00:00:17,626 --> 00:00:20,561
You want to use brain surgery
for a psychiatric disorder?

10
00:00:20,563 --> 00:00:23,063
DBS isn't FDA-approved
for anorexia treatment here.

11
00:00:23,065 --> 00:00:24,164
It's not a real option.

12
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:26,600
My wife's decided against
the valve-repair surgery,

13
00:00:26,602 --> 00:00:28,669
at least until she's tried
the deep brain stimulation.

14
00:00:28,671 --> 00:00:30,104
You won't be a part of the surgery.

15
00:00:30,106 --> 00:00:31,638
Or any of my surgeries.

16
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,108
You went around me,
directly to the patient.

17
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,078
You're booting me off your service?

18
00:00:53,215 --> 00:00:56,196
Oh, he's... very affectionate.

19
00:00:56,198 --> 00:00:57,731
Ooh. Yeah.

20
00:01:06,008 --> 00:01:09,276
Cats are smart and independent.

21
00:01:10,053 --> 00:01:11,962
I don't think my first pet

22
00:01:11,964 --> 00:01:13,847
should be something I'm allergic to.

23
00:01:15,683 --> 00:01:17,017
Oh.

24
00:01:19,722 --> 00:01:24,158
Did you know constrictors
don't crush their prey?

25
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,528
They induce arterial
circulatory collapse.

26
00:01:36,705 --> 00:01:38,472
He looks like a Hubert.

27
00:01:38,474 --> 00:01:45,279
The pH should be maintained
within a range of 7.1 to 7.3.

28
00:01:45,281 --> 00:01:48,615
And we're supposed to
add 3 drops of Klor-out

29
00:01:48,617 --> 00:01:50,817
to neutralize the tap water.

30
00:01:54,189 --> 00:01:55,422
Don't worry, Hubert.

31
00:01:55,424 --> 00:01:57,925
Daddy just shows his love
in a different way.

32
00:02:04,032 --> 00:02:06,166
Mnh-mnh, no.

33
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:07,901
You don't come by for a month,
and then you think

34
00:02:07,903 --> 00:02:09,903
a store-bought pie is gonna
make it all right?

35
00:02:09,905 --> 00:02:12,039
It's from the Farmer's Market.

36
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:13,373
- Uh-huh.
- Mm-hmm.

37
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:14,741
Fine. Hand it over.

38
00:02:14,743 --> 00:02:16,176
Bring it in.

39
00:02:16,178 --> 00:02:18,645
- Hey.
- Thanks for coming.

40
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,359
How is she?

41
00:02:23,151 --> 00:02:26,119
Why didn't you tell me
things were getting so bad?

42
00:02:26,121 --> 00:02:28,121
- I would have come.
- You're busy.

43
00:02:28,123 --> 00:02:30,657
I will always make time for you, Kay.

44
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:32,526
Good, 'cause you're not leaving

45
00:02:32,528 --> 00:02:35,095
until the three of us
finish a bottle of Merlot.

46
00:02:35,097 --> 00:02:36,630
Did you call that oncologist

47
00:02:36,632 --> 00:02:38,865
doing the new ovarian cancer
PARP-I trial?

48
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:41,702
The intake doctor said I don't
have the right tumor markers.

49
00:02:41,704 --> 00:02:43,470
Then you need to go back to your hos...

50
00:02:43,472 --> 00:02:49,243
My... My team put me
on hospice last week.

51
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:52,346
Do you want a dose of morphine?

52
00:02:52,348 --> 00:02:53,847
No. I got it.

53
00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:56,917
Just give it a minute to pass.

54
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:58,352
Her doctors keep upping the dosage,

55
00:02:58,354 --> 00:03:00,721
but it's not helping anymore.

56
00:03:00,723 --> 00:03:02,856
- Nothing is.
- Ohh.

Hey, um...

60
00:03:27,783 --> 00:03:29,950
Um, my college roommate was diagnosed

61
00:03:29,952 --> 00:03:32,653
with stage 4 ovarian cancer a year ago.

62
00:03:32,655 --> 00:03:35,756
She's had six cycles of Carbo-Taxol

63
00:03:35,758 --> 00:03:38,558
without cyto-reductive surgery
due to widespread disease.

64
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,928
They stopped chemo when
she stopped responding.

65
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,198
She has a month at most.

66
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,167
Wow. I'm so sorry to hear that, Claire.

67
00:03:47,169 --> 00:03:48,435
As am I.

68
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:50,370
And I assume you're not here
just seeking sympathy.

69
00:03:50,372 --> 00:03:52,606
I have reviewed her scans
and she can't be cured,

70
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:55,208
but this metastatic lesion
extending through her diaphragm

71
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:57,744
is causing most of her pain.

72
00:03:57,746 --> 00:04:00,347
Her surgeon has ruled out removing it

73
00:04:00,349 --> 00:04:01,982
due to vascular complexity.

74
00:04:01,984 --> 00:04:06,086
But I think laparoscopic
debulking is possible.

75
00:04:06,088 --> 00:04:08,655
Difficult, but possible.

76
00:04:12,026 --> 00:04:13,694
I know you're upset with me,

77
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:17,074
but sh-she's my friend and she's in pain.

78
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,033
I need your help.

79
00:04:20,035 --> 00:04:21,768
I'll take a look at her today.

80
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:23,872
Thank you.

81
00:04:24,673 --> 00:04:26,206
We need a surgeon over here!

82
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:27,441
He fell down the stairs
at a construction site

83
00:04:27,443 --> 00:04:28,642
while holding a nail gun.

84
00:04:28,644 --> 00:04:30,744
Portable head X-ray, stat.
Any other injuries?

85
00:04:30,746 --> 00:04:33,213
Nah. Just yank it off
and slap a Band-Aid.

86
00:04:33,215 --> 00:04:34,748
- Any weakness?
- No.

87
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,398
All right. On my count.

88
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,552
One, two, three.

89
00:05:08,483 --> 00:05:09,983
Let's get you that Band-Aid.

90
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,753
We could have done that for free at home

91
00:05:12,755 --> 00:05:14,287
with a pair of vise grips.

92
00:05:14,289 --> 00:05:15,622
You don't pay for our equipment.

93
00:05:15,624 --> 00:05:17,758
You pay for me to tell you
that he got lucky.

94
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,326
It's superficial.

95
00:05:19,328 --> 00:05:20,460
His pressure's dropping.

96
00:05:21,864 --> 00:05:24,297
- You feeling faint?
- A little banged up.

97
00:05:24,299 --> 00:05:26,199
All right, something else is going on.

98
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:27,801
Let's log-roll him.

99
00:05:30,004 --> 00:05:31,738
What's wrong with my brother?

100
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,174
I see a puncture wound in his flank.

101
00:05:34,176 --> 00:05:35,776
There's a nail in his abdomen, too.

102
00:05:35,778 --> 00:05:37,310
Let's get him up to the O.R.

103
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:47,087
How bad is the pain?

104
00:05:47,089 --> 00:05:48,822
Maybe a six.

105
00:05:48,824 --> 00:05:50,457
She's lying.

106
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:52,092
She, uh, hides it well,

107
00:05:52,094 --> 00:05:54,060
but she's in terrible pain all the time.

108
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,562
But Claire said you're not out of options

109
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:57,597
until Dr. Melendez says you are.

110
00:05:59,704 --> 00:06:01,638
So, am I?

111
00:06:01,663 --> 00:06:04,330
I think we can make things
a little easier for you.

112
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:07,800
How soon?

113
00:06:07,802 --> 00:06:09,669
Dr. Park and I will do it today.

114
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:13,339
What about Claire?

115
00:06:13,341 --> 00:06:14,841
I came here because of her.

116
00:06:14,843 --> 00:06:16,442
Dr. Park is excellent.

117
00:06:16,444 --> 00:06:18,144
You're in very capable hands.

118
00:06:19,313 --> 00:06:23,216
When my doctors gave up on me,
Claire found a way.

119
00:06:23,218 --> 00:06:26,453
I trust her. I won't do
this surgery without her.

120
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:32,325
Dr. Park and Dr. Browne
will prep you for surgery.

121
00:07:01,156 --> 00:07:02,622
Now try that again.

122
00:07:02,624 --> 00:07:03,890
Show me.

123
00:07:03,892 --> 00:07:05,959
Straight. Straight.

124
00:07:05,961 --> 00:07:07,427
Straight. Yeah.

125
00:07:07,429 --> 00:07:09,496
Oh, almost.

126
00:07:12,267 --> 00:07:14,400
And pull back up.

127
00:07:14,402 --> 00:07:15,535
That's good.

128
00:07:15,537 --> 00:07:16,636
Thank you.

129
00:07:19,573 --> 00:07:21,774
The nail completely ruptured the kidney.

130
00:07:21,776 --> 00:07:23,345
Renal hilum's blown, too.

131
00:07:23,347 --> 00:07:24,744
4-0 on a driver.

132
00:07:30,619 --> 00:07:32,919
This isn't working.
Clamp the renal vessels.

133
00:07:32,921 --> 00:07:34,520
He's gonna have to live without it.

134
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:38,091
Expose the other kidney,

135
00:07:38,093 --> 00:07:40,159
make sure it's got that new-car smell.

136
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:45,765
The adrenal gland is low-lying.

137
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:48,901
You won't find the left kidney there.

138
00:07:48,903 --> 00:07:50,570
You expect her to find it on the right?

139
00:07:50,572 --> 00:07:52,805
No. The most likely reason

140
00:07:52,807 --> 00:07:56,409
for the gland to be lower
is unilateral renal agenesis.

141
00:08:03,885 --> 00:08:06,085
He was born with one kidney.

142
00:08:19,534 --> 00:08:21,134
Is that the vena cava?

143
00:08:21,136 --> 00:08:22,702
There's so much tumor in there,

144
00:08:22,704 --> 00:08:24,337
it's hard to tell what anything is.

145
00:08:24,339 --> 00:08:28,975
I need to free this segment
without nicking that vein or...

146
00:08:29,826 --> 00:08:33,913
Park, pull on that fragment
very carefully.

147
00:08:33,915 --> 00:08:35,048
Got it.

148
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:37,334
All right. Claire, I need you to tilt...

149
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:40,887
Exactly.

150
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:42,922
The tumor's invaded the vessel wall.

151
00:08:54,035 --> 00:08:56,202
I think you got it.

152
00:09:01,976 --> 00:09:05,011
Why isn't there tumor tissue
penetrating her diaphragm?

153
00:09:07,081 --> 00:09:08,314
Hmm.

154
00:09:08,316 --> 00:09:09,682
The CT scan showed...

155
00:09:09,684 --> 00:09:12,752
The segment we removed was
displacing the diaphragm upward,

156
00:09:12,754 --> 00:09:14,887
giving the appearance
of chest infiltration.

157
00:09:16,123 --> 00:09:18,324
If the cancer's just in her abdomen,

158
00:09:18,326 --> 00:09:21,094
she could be a candidate
for HIPEC treatment.

159
00:09:21,096 --> 00:09:22,361
Treatment?

160
00:09:22,363 --> 00:09:24,263
Not pain relief?

161
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,267
We may be able to give her
a little more time.

162
00:09:34,882 --> 00:09:36,195
It's called HIPEC surgery.

163
00:09:36,197 --> 00:09:38,011
I'd remove as much tumor as possible,

164
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:39,774
and then we'd infuse your abdomen

165
00:09:39,776 --> 00:09:42,172
with a chemotherapy
solution for 90 minutes.

166
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,915
It could give you another six months.

167
00:09:46,318 --> 00:09:48,319
It comes with a big risk.

168
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:52,356
This is a major operation,
and your body's frail.

169
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:54,244
You could die on the table.

170
00:09:57,262 --> 00:10:00,965
Uh... I-I want more time.

171
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:02,826
But her pain is finally manageable.

172
00:10:02,828 --> 00:10:06,464
I-I'm afraid to press our luck anymore.

173
00:10:08,961 --> 00:10:12,029
The thought of gambling
away your last few weeks

174
00:10:12,031 --> 00:10:16,767
terrifies me, too, but this wasn't luck.

175
00:10:16,769 --> 00:10:20,238
Dr. Melendez has proved that
despite all of the challenges

176
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,542
of your cancer, he can safely
navigate inside your abdomen.

177
00:10:26,311 --> 00:10:29,247
I think it's worth putting
your trust in him again.

178
00:10:36,488 --> 00:10:37,522
Okay.

179
00:10:40,158 --> 00:10:42,927
We'll start with a complete PET-CT scan

180
00:10:42,929 --> 00:10:44,762
so we can plan our approach.

181
00:10:53,373 --> 00:10:56,240
He has extensive vein thrombosis.

182
00:10:56,242 --> 00:10:57,642
There's a clear segment we can use

183
00:10:57,644 --> 00:10:59,210
for an AV dialysis graft.

184
00:10:59,212 --> 00:11:03,447
It's short, but we can attach it
to the brachial artery...

185
00:11:03,449 --> 00:11:05,550
Ohh.

186
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,088
Hello, Lea.

187
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:11,589
I'm sorry, but I can't talk right...

188
00:11:11,591 --> 00:11:13,573
<i>There's a problem with Hubert.</i>

189
00:11:14,894 --> 00:11:17,328
Oh, okay.

190
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:19,897
Yeah. The pH is exactly 7.2,

191
00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:22,600
temp's 73, everything is perfect.

192
00:11:22,602 --> 00:11:23,634
<i>Perfect.</i>

193
00:11:23,636 --> 00:11:24,735
He looks bored.

194
00:11:25,971 --> 00:11:27,271
Bored?

195
00:11:27,273 --> 00:11:29,774
He can't be bored.

196
00:11:29,776 --> 00:11:31,142
He's a fish.

197
00:11:31,144 --> 00:11:34,011
He's just floating there
with nothing to do.

198
00:11:34,013 --> 00:11:35,813
<i>I thought you were working today.</i>

199
00:11:35,815 --> 00:11:37,315
I was... from home.

200
00:11:37,317 --> 00:11:39,917
Now I'm procrastinating with Hubert.

201
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:41,285
<i>You should work.</i>

202
00:11:41,287 --> 00:11:43,821
Okay, can you pick up one
of those little castles?

203
00:11:43,823 --> 00:11:45,323
Mm.

204
00:11:45,325 --> 00:11:47,148
Okay.

205
00:11:47,827 --> 00:11:49,594
I'm not sure who's being domesticated...

206
00:11:49,596 --> 00:11:51,596
you or the fish.

207
00:11:51,598 --> 00:11:53,863
Uh, yes, I'm still here.

208
00:11:56,069 --> 00:11:57,902
Call us if anything changes.

209
00:11:57,904 --> 00:11:59,904
Due to his tissue type,

210
00:11:59,906 --> 00:12:03,007
UNOS doesn't expect to
locate a match in time.

211
00:12:03,009 --> 00:12:04,742
We'll need to find a living donor.

212
00:12:07,813 --> 00:12:09,547
You did a great job today.

213
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:15,620
Ooh! You want some pirate booty
and a juice box with that?

214
00:12:17,457 --> 00:12:19,323
You keep me waiting for hours on end.

215
00:12:19,325 --> 00:12:20,691
Now at least I have something to do.

216
00:12:20,693 --> 00:12:22,126
Cancer is keeping you waiting.

217
00:12:22,128 --> 00:12:24,895
- Yeah.
- We're ready for you.

218
00:12:24,897 --> 00:12:27,298
Here you go. Oh, you can keep that.

219
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,800
Oh. Oh, thank you.

220
00:12:29,802 --> 00:12:31,035
Bye.

221
00:12:32,738 --> 00:12:34,705
That story is not gonna end well, is it?

222
00:12:34,707 --> 00:12:35,947
Mnh.

223
00:12:36,609 --> 00:12:38,609
You know, the yo-yo has been around

224
00:12:38,611 --> 00:12:40,811
for 1,400 years, since ancient China.

225
00:12:40,813 --> 00:12:42,113
Watch this.

226
00:12:44,984 --> 00:12:47,184
You're not my only patient.

227
00:12:47,186 --> 00:12:50,755
Remembering and executing these tricks

228
00:12:50,757 --> 00:12:52,890
will help with my sequential memory

229
00:12:52,892 --> 00:12:55,359
and protect my brain
against your radiation.

230
00:12:55,361 --> 00:12:57,395
With this new targeted therapy,
I can better focus

231
00:12:57,397 --> 00:13:00,564
on just knocking the things out
of your head that I want to.

232
00:13:00,566 --> 00:13:03,134
Of course I'm also
making a little wish list

233
00:13:03,136 --> 00:13:05,169
about other things I might
want to get rid of.

234
00:13:13,211 --> 00:13:14,612
I'm worried.

235
00:13:14,614 --> 00:13:17,748
Whether it's tomorrow
or a few months from now,

236
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,051
Dash is gonna lose me.

237
00:13:20,053 --> 00:13:22,053
And he'll be devastated.

238
00:13:22,055 --> 00:13:25,038
He's an amazing, loving husband.

239
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:29,927
I want you to go out with him.

240
00:13:29,929 --> 00:13:32,263
What?

241
00:13:32,265 --> 00:13:33,564
You two get along.

242
00:13:33,566 --> 00:13:35,800
You even have chemistry.

243
00:13:35,802 --> 00:13:37,635
No. We're friends.

244
00:13:37,637 --> 00:13:39,537
If Dash is gonna move on with his life,

245
00:13:39,539 --> 00:13:41,405
he needs something to live for.

246
00:13:41,407 --> 00:13:43,674
I think that could be you.

247
00:13:45,178 --> 00:13:46,777
We need to begin now.

248
00:13:53,051 --> 00:13:54,485
Okay.

249
00:13:59,392 --> 00:14:01,192
Don't say a word.

250
00:14:01,194 --> 00:14:02,993
It's none of my business.

251
00:14:05,998 --> 00:14:08,432
- Dash seems like a nice guy.
- Shut up.

252
00:14:10,769 --> 00:14:13,038
- You're a perfect match.
- Great.

253
00:14:13,063 --> 00:14:14,863
We just need you to
sign the consent forms.

254
00:14:16,508 --> 00:14:19,610
Donation carries several risks,

255
00:14:19,612 --> 00:14:22,947
including blood clots,
infection, hemorrhage,

256
00:14:22,949 --> 00:14:26,016
lung collapse, and possibly death.

257
00:14:26,018 --> 00:14:27,985
There are also lifelong risks,

258
00:14:27,987 --> 00:14:30,888
such as high blood pressure,
which can cause a heart attack,

259
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:32,957
and protein-losing nephropathy,

260
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,558
which can impair your remaining kidney,

261
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,294
leading to the need for
a transplant yourself.

262
00:14:40,499 --> 00:14:41,565
It's a big ask.

263
00:14:41,567 --> 00:14:43,334
Yes, it is.

264
00:14:48,106 --> 00:14:51,008
I'm happy to sign the forms
on one condition.

265
00:14:52,511 --> 00:14:54,278
I'm not selling the business.

266
00:14:55,882 --> 00:14:57,681
I told you 10 times.

267
00:14:57,683 --> 00:14:59,817
We're not taking that offer.

268
00:14:59,819 --> 00:15:02,119
Either sell or buy me out
at the same price.

269
00:15:02,121 --> 00:15:03,254
You know I can't afford that.

270
00:15:03,256 --> 00:15:04,755
I can't afford anything.

271
00:15:04,757 --> 00:15:06,323
Look, Dad left you in charge,

272
00:15:06,325 --> 00:15:08,793
but all of my money is tied up in it.

273
00:15:08,795 --> 00:15:10,127
I got investment opportunities.

274
00:15:10,129 --> 00:15:12,196
I got things that I'm excited about.

275
00:15:12,198 --> 00:15:14,999
Dad left me in charge because
when things got tough,

276
00:15:15,001 --> 00:15:17,067
you took off to college while we rebuilt.

277
00:15:17,069 --> 00:15:20,104
- And now you want to cash in?
- We'll both cash in.

278
00:15:20,106 --> 00:15:22,606
The deal I negotiated is way over-market.

279
00:15:22,608 --> 00:15:24,508
I don't care how good the deal is.

280
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:27,545
- I like what I do.
- And I like my kidney.

281
00:15:27,547 --> 00:15:29,980
It seems we both need
to make a sacrifice.

282
00:15:32,584 --> 00:15:33,918
I'm not selling.

283
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:46,769
Kayla's back in her room.

284
00:15:46,771 --> 00:15:47,970
We finished her staging,

285
00:15:47,972 --> 00:15:51,040
and everything supports
our operative plan.

286
00:15:51,042 --> 00:15:54,478
Do you have any questions
about her upcoming surgery?

287
00:15:55,013 --> 00:15:56,689
Uh...

288
00:15:58,283 --> 00:16:02,945
did Kay bring up anything about, uh...

289
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:05,531
us?

290
00:16:08,059 --> 00:16:09,992
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

291
00:16:09,994 --> 00:16:11,694
I told her not to do that.

292
00:16:11,696 --> 00:16:13,329
I mean, it's, uh...

293
00:16:13,331 --> 00:16:14,964
It's nuts, you know?

294
00:16:14,966 --> 00:16:18,267
Well, that's a little insulting.

295
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:20,269
Uh...

296
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:22,004
I'm kidding.

297
00:16:22,006 --> 00:16:23,005
It's insane.

298
00:16:24,175 --> 00:16:26,275
Uh... just, you know...

299
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:28,578
we'll just forget she mentioned it, okay?

300
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,047
Will she?

301
00:16:31,049 --> 00:16:32,915
I mean, we've both said no.

302
00:16:32,917 --> 00:16:34,283
What's she gonna do?

303
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:36,052
You've been married to her eight years.

304
00:16:36,054 --> 00:16:38,481
You still ask that question?

305
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:42,325
Well, we, uh, do have one other choice.

306
00:16:44,094 --> 00:16:45,328
You guys have a chapel here, right?

307
00:16:47,765 --> 00:16:49,365
He's exploiting this situation.

308
00:16:49,367 --> 00:16:51,667
Yes. He's entitled to.

309
00:16:53,036 --> 00:16:54,570
You don't think an organ donation

310
00:16:54,572 --> 00:16:56,572
should be an altruistic act?

311
00:16:56,574 --> 00:16:58,107
Can it be?

312
00:16:58,109 --> 00:17:00,042
A majority of donors do it

313
00:17:00,044 --> 00:17:02,511
to make their own lives more worthwhile,

314
00:17:02,513 --> 00:17:03,946
and almost a quarter do it

315
00:17:03,948 --> 00:17:06,282
to relieve guilt over a past mistake.

316
00:17:06,284 --> 00:17:10,052
Redemption, meaning, sure, but not money.

317
00:17:10,054 --> 00:17:12,255
So, you never take
an opportunity to get ahead

318
00:17:12,257 --> 00:17:13,623
at someone else's expense?

319
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:16,192
I'm competing, not trafficking organs.

320
00:17:16,194 --> 00:17:17,727
I need Armando's kidney.

321
00:17:17,729 --> 00:17:20,263
And I need it without getting
dragged into their family drama,

322
00:17:20,265 --> 00:17:21,797
which is why I have residents.

323
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:23,866
So you two find a way to make it happen.

324
00:17:27,104 --> 00:17:29,972
This central line will
allow us to monitor your heart

325
00:17:29,974 --> 00:17:31,641
during tomorrow's surgery.

326
00:17:31,643 --> 00:17:33,943
Have you considered my proposal?

327
00:17:35,212 --> 00:17:38,681
I have been more focused on your surgery

328
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:40,549
than seducing your husband.

329
00:17:40,551 --> 00:17:42,451
Typical.

330
00:17:42,453 --> 00:17:43,819
Ah. You got me.

331
00:17:43,821 --> 00:17:47,189
I'm not dating my cancer-riddled
friend's husband

332
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:48,624
because I have commitment issues.

333
00:17:48,626 --> 00:17:50,226
You've been sprinting away from men

334
00:17:50,228 --> 00:17:51,627
as long as I've known you.

335
00:17:51,629 --> 00:17:52,728
Yeah.

336
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:54,997
I will find the time
when I have the time.

337
00:17:54,999 --> 00:17:57,600
It will never be the right time.

338
00:17:57,602 --> 00:17:59,702
You're afraid to get hurt.

339
00:18:02,205 --> 00:18:04,573
I know how short life is.

340
00:18:04,575 --> 00:18:07,209
I don't want you to miss out
on the best part of it.

341
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,544
All done.

342
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:10,513
What do I owe you for
the therapy session?

343
00:18:10,515 --> 00:18:11,681
Date my husband.

344
00:18:11,683 --> 00:18:13,883
Do you know how stupid that sounds?

345
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:16,419
I want someone to take care
of the man that I love.

346
00:18:16,421 --> 00:18:19,021
- Does that sound stupid?
- Yes, very, but...

347
00:18:20,824 --> 00:18:22,224
Please.

348
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,793
Please, would you just drop this?

349
00:18:25,095 --> 00:18:28,507
I will drop this. If... one date.

350
00:18:29,266 --> 00:18:30,766
One dinner. That's all.

351
00:18:30,768 --> 00:18:33,936
But a real one, not a latte in the café.

352
00:18:33,938 --> 00:18:37,840
I want a real date...
appetizers, main course, wine.

353
00:18:37,842 --> 00:18:40,309
- I'm on call.
- No wine. But candles.

354
00:18:40,311 --> 00:18:42,378
I want candles.

355
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,080
One date. I will never mention

356
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:45,815
any of this again.

357
00:18:48,652 --> 00:18:50,753
It's a federal crime to
barter a human organ

358
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:51,787
for anything of value.

359
00:18:51,789 --> 00:18:53,456
I'm not selling Santiago anything.

360
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:55,257
You're receiving money from a third party

361
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:56,692
in exchange for your kidney.

362
00:18:56,694 --> 00:19:00,629
He's receiving money from
a third party for his business.

363
00:19:00,631 --> 00:19:01,964
So is his brother.

364
00:19:01,966 --> 00:19:03,566
He should love him enough to not...

365
00:19:03,568 --> 00:19:05,000
I love him enough to give him a kidney.

366
00:19:05,002 --> 00:19:06,602
He should love me enough
to accept an offer

367
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:08,304
that would improve my life, too.

368
00:19:08,306 --> 00:19:10,539
I mean, it's a much lower
ask than a vital organ.

369
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:12,375
You're not allowed to ask for anything.

370
00:19:12,377 --> 00:19:13,442
Are you saying that if he agrees

371
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:14,744
you're not gonna perform the surgery?

372
00:19:14,746 --> 00:19:16,112
- He doesn't agree.
- He will.

373
00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:17,646
Everything in life is transactional,

374
00:19:17,648 --> 00:19:19,882
and in this case,
I've got all the leverage.

375
00:19:19,884 --> 00:19:23,018
- Leverage?
- It's what you have that they need.

376
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,588
It's how you shift a deal in your favor.

377
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:28,424
You guys have no leverage
and no cards to play.

378
00:19:28,426 --> 00:19:30,326
Yes, we do.

379
00:19:30,328 --> 00:19:33,362
I don't believe you're willing
to let your brother die.

380
00:19:33,364 --> 00:19:35,664
A good negotiator doesn't bluff.

381
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:37,867
If you cave on a threat,
you lose all credibility.

382
00:19:37,869 --> 00:19:40,202
And Santiago knows I'm a good negotiator.

383
00:19:40,204 --> 00:19:41,937
So he won't die

384
00:19:41,939 --> 00:19:44,440
precisely because I'm willing to let him.

385
00:19:48,612 --> 00:19:50,546
I'll talk to your brother.

386
00:19:50,548 --> 00:19:52,248
Okay.

387
00:20:13,604 --> 00:20:17,072
Um how long do we have to stay?

388
00:20:17,074 --> 00:20:20,176
She said dinner, so I assume
till we're done eating?

389
00:20:20,178 --> 00:20:21,410
Okay.

390
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:25,347
- Dessert?
- Do you want any?

391
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:26,749
- Not really.
- I think we're good.

392
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:28,751
- Okay.
- Okay.

393
00:20:44,735 --> 00:20:46,602
Look at that old clock.

394
00:20:46,604 --> 00:20:48,604
It's the same as the one
that they had at Meline's,

395
00:20:48,606 --> 00:20:50,005
off campus.

396
00:20:50,007 --> 00:20:51,340
Oh, yeah.

397
00:20:54,678 --> 00:20:56,712
Hey, remember that time we went
there on that double date?

398
00:20:57,881 --> 00:20:59,982
You set me up with your English T.A.

399
00:20:59,984 --> 00:21:02,084
Yeah. Kay said it was a bad idea.

400
00:21:02,086 --> 00:21:04,787
I just remember him droning on about

401
00:21:04,789 --> 00:21:07,623
Dryden's influence
on 18th-century literature.

402
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:09,325
If you hadn't stepped in,
I think I might have

403
00:21:09,327 --> 00:21:11,260
stabbed him with my salad fork.

404
00:21:11,262 --> 00:21:13,095
Ah, Kay always knew better.

405
00:21:13,097 --> 00:21:16,665
Yeah. She fixed me up three times.

406
00:21:16,667 --> 00:21:18,834
- Then she gave up.
- Until now.

407
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:37,486
You should sell the business.

408
00:21:37,488 --> 00:21:39,156
Excuse me?

409
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:42,024
You would live.

410
00:21:42,026 --> 00:21:46,428
And you could take the proceeds
and start a new business

411
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:49,164
without your brother as a partner.

412
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:51,800
It's a good deal.

413
00:21:51,802 --> 00:21:55,237
Benitez Builders is my father's legacy.

414
00:21:55,239 --> 00:21:57,072
He built it from nothing.

415
00:21:57,074 --> 00:22:00,442
He was committed, hardworking, honorable.

416
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,763
He expected the same thing
from both of us.

417
00:22:03,847 --> 00:22:08,484
My dad was difficult to please.

418
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,322
I worked hard to be someone that
my father could be proud of.

419
00:22:13,324 --> 00:22:16,392
And I'm the one he trusted
with the controlling share.

420
00:22:16,394 --> 00:22:18,994
I'd rather die than let him down.

421
00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:26,835
Is that bothering you?

422
00:22:26,837 --> 00:22:28,470
Yeah. A little bit.

423
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:36,579
The graft is failing.

424
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:41,917
Oh!

425
00:22:45,089 --> 00:22:47,623
What's happening?

426
00:22:49,962 --> 00:22:52,323
Infusing heparin. He's hypercoagulable.

427
00:22:52,325 --> 00:22:54,732
The tunnel catheter is gonna
clot off just like the graft.

428
00:22:55,546 --> 00:22:58,514
That gives him even less leverage.

429
00:22:58,516 --> 00:23:02,284
It should convince Santiago to
accept his brother's offer.

430
00:23:02,286 --> 00:23:04,686
Santiago? Why him?

431
00:23:04,688 --> 00:23:06,288
I'm negotiating.

432
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:07,790
With the wrong brother.

433
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,717
The catheter's already obstructing.

434
00:23:11,719 --> 00:23:13,162
Whatever we're doing,

435
00:23:13,164 --> 00:23:15,330
it needs to happen in
the next couple of days.

436
00:23:18,268 --> 00:23:20,736
We'll do a live donor drive.

437
00:23:20,738 --> 00:23:22,137
Okay.

438
00:23:22,139 --> 00:23:24,173
One in 100,000 chance of success,

439
00:23:24,175 --> 00:23:25,874
but better than planning his funeral.

440
00:23:25,876 --> 00:23:28,177
I think the odds are better than that.

441
00:23:28,179 --> 00:23:29,812
We don't need to find a match.

442
00:23:29,814 --> 00:23:31,880
We just need the parade of
selfless family members

443
00:23:31,882 --> 00:23:34,283
to embarrass Armando into
doing the right thing.

444
00:23:39,189 --> 00:23:41,256
Evening, roomie.

445
00:23:41,258 --> 00:23:43,158
Evening, roomie.

446
00:23:51,901 --> 00:23:53,469
Hubert is dead.

447
00:23:53,471 --> 00:23:54,570
Yeah.

448
00:23:56,506 --> 00:23:57,573
Hmm.

449
00:23:57,575 --> 00:23:59,141
That's odd.

450
00:23:59,143 --> 00:24:01,076
I'm not sure if I overfed him

451
00:24:01,078 --> 00:24:03,879
or if it was when I changed
the water to clean his pebbles,

452
00:24:03,881 --> 00:24:06,882
but, yeah, definitely dead.

453
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,288
We can get another fish.

454
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:15,357
We don't need to.

455
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:19,061
There are many fish in the sea.

456
00:24:19,063 --> 00:24:21,096
I said no.

457
00:24:21,098 --> 00:24:22,931
You wanted a pet.

458
00:24:22,933 --> 00:24:24,166
I got one.

459
00:24:24,168 --> 00:24:25,701
Very briefly.

460
00:24:25,703 --> 00:24:26,902
I'll go tomorrow and...

461
00:24:26,904 --> 00:24:28,470
No!

462
00:24:45,189 --> 00:24:47,523
Are you crying?

463
00:24:51,895 --> 00:24:53,629
Are you sad?

464
00:24:56,266 --> 00:24:58,367
I'm sad.

465
00:24:58,369 --> 00:25:02,504
And I'm angry and frustrated and upset.

466
00:25:05,542 --> 00:25:07,910
We should get another fish.

467
00:25:07,912 --> 00:25:11,446
The fish isn't the problem.

468
00:25:11,448 --> 00:25:13,415
I am.

469
00:25:13,417 --> 00:25:15,417
I'm pathetic.

470
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:17,052
I went home to Hershey

471
00:25:17,054 --> 00:25:19,755
because I was unfulfilled with my life.

472
00:25:19,757 --> 00:25:24,092
I thought I could help
my bullheaded brother

473
00:25:24,094 --> 00:25:25,727
save the shop,

474
00:25:25,729 --> 00:25:29,928
be a part of something
I was really passionate about.

475
00:25:30,334 --> 00:25:32,935
Instead, we ended up tanking it together,

476
00:25:32,937 --> 00:25:34,403
along with our relationship.

477
00:25:34,405 --> 00:25:36,872
I came back here to get
my life back on track.

478
00:25:36,874 --> 00:25:38,373
How am I supposed to do that

479
00:25:38,375 --> 00:25:40,576
if I can't even keep a damn fish alive?

480
00:26:11,508 --> 00:26:13,308
I'll make it through this.

481
00:26:35,565 --> 00:26:38,767
It is okay to be afraid.

482
00:26:40,036 --> 00:26:42,437
How was your dinner with Dash?

483
00:26:44,941 --> 00:26:46,775
Forget about that.

484
00:26:46,777 --> 00:26:48,810
How are you?

485
00:26:48,812 --> 00:26:50,746
If I don't make it,
you have to give this thing

486
00:26:50,748 --> 00:26:51,947
with Dash a real shot.

487
00:26:51,949 --> 00:26:54,082
Kayla, please stop.

488
00:26:54,084 --> 00:26:56,718
Promise me. You have to.

489
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,053
No.

490
00:26:58,055 --> 00:27:00,689
You can't put that on me.

491
00:27:00,691 --> 00:27:04,693
That's right. Claire never
turns her back on a friend,

492
00:27:04,695 --> 00:27:07,362
as long as it doesn't
put her heart at risk.

493
00:27:08,931 --> 00:27:10,465
That is not fair.

494
00:27:10,467 --> 00:27:13,435
- What you're asking...
- I'm asking you to trust my judgment

495
00:27:13,437 --> 00:27:15,270
- about the two of you.
- No, you're trying to pressure me

496
00:27:15,272 --> 00:27:16,838
into something that I don't want.

497
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,421
- Like you always do.
- You need pushing

498
00:27:19,423 --> 00:27:21,877
because you've never known
what's best for you.

499
00:27:23,613 --> 00:27:28,450
S-So, is that why you dragged me out

500
00:27:28,452 --> 00:27:32,254
to pledge week to be rejected
by every sorority on campus?

501
00:27:32,256 --> 00:27:34,189
Or... Or went behind my back

502
00:27:34,191 --> 00:27:36,058
and invited my mother to graduation?

503
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,659
At least you tried.

504
00:27:37,661 --> 00:27:38,960
You put something at risk.

505
00:27:38,962 --> 00:27:41,430
No. Give me a break.

506
00:27:41,432 --> 00:27:43,732
This was never about me, none of it.

507
00:27:43,734 --> 00:27:46,868
You always have to have it your way.

508
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:49,538
You are a neurotic control freak

509
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,640
who thinks she has the right
to dictate how everyone else

510
00:27:51,642 --> 00:27:53,408
should live their lives.

511
00:27:57,413 --> 00:27:58,480
It's time.

512
00:27:58,482 --> 00:28:00,148
I'm ready.

513
00:28:02,886 --> 00:28:04,186
Kayla...

514
00:28:26,843 --> 00:28:31,680
I'm sure you recognize Rafael,
your second cousin from Oxnard.

515
00:28:31,682 --> 00:28:34,149
He drove up as soon as he heard.

516
00:28:34,151 --> 00:28:36,518
Either we get lucky here
and you look like an ass,

517
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:39,454
or we don't and you look like
an ass with a dead brother.

518
00:28:39,456 --> 00:28:41,156
Mm.

519
00:28:44,193 --> 00:28:47,095
He won't give his life for
a contracting company.

520
00:28:49,365 --> 00:28:52,567
He's not dying for the company.

521
00:28:52,569 --> 00:28:54,569
He's dying for your father.

522
00:28:57,507 --> 00:28:59,554
What makes you think that?

523
00:29:00,244 --> 00:29:04,768
He would rather die than
let your father down.

524
00:29:06,655 --> 00:29:08,956
He thinks that's what Dad would want?

525
00:29:11,855 --> 00:29:14,289
Santi did everything
the old man asked of him,

526
00:29:14,291 --> 00:29:16,258
worked twice as hard,
did everything twice as well

527
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,160
as Dad ever could, but nothing

528
00:29:18,162 --> 00:29:20,295
was ever good enough for our father.

529
00:29:20,297 --> 00:29:22,197
No matter what we did,
he was always right there

530
00:29:22,199 --> 00:29:24,800
to point out where we had gone wrong.

531
00:29:26,869 --> 00:29:29,417
You know what he told me on his deathbed?

532
00:29:30,207 --> 00:29:31,807
He said that he wasn't proud of Santi

533
00:29:31,809 --> 00:29:34,109
for following in his footsteps...

534
00:29:34,111 --> 00:29:36,411
that he was disappointed that he settled.

535
00:29:40,149 --> 00:29:44,119
You should tell your brother that.

536
00:29:44,121 --> 00:29:46,354
It's a good card to play.

537
00:29:54,565 --> 00:29:56,264
He was wrong.

538
00:29:57,701 --> 00:30:00,569
You are the most loyal, hardworking,

539
00:30:00,571 --> 00:30:03,451
and principled guy I've ever known.

540
00:30:03,974 --> 00:30:06,208
And you deserve Dad's respect.

541
00:30:11,548 --> 00:30:15,116
You greedy, lying snake.

542
00:30:15,118 --> 00:30:17,586
You will say anything
to get what you want,

543
00:30:17,588 --> 00:30:19,387
even trying to ruin
the memories I have of Dad.

544
00:30:19,389 --> 00:30:20,622
Your memories of Dad?

545
00:30:20,624 --> 00:30:22,858
He was horrible. You know that.

546
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,359
Get the hell out.

547
00:30:24,361 --> 00:30:26,628
- Santi, I'm not trying to...
- Get out!

548
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:53,333
Give me the consent forms.

549
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:15,389
My father told me he wished
I hadn't been born.

550
00:31:15,391 --> 00:31:17,624
I wasn't worth the trouble.

551
00:31:20,495 --> 00:31:26,199
But I knew I was worth the trouble

552
00:31:26,201 --> 00:31:31,790
because my brother always
looked out for me...

553
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:38,245
...even when it made his life harder.

554
00:32:24,727 --> 00:32:26,678
5-0 prolene.

555
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:30,515
Position the kidney in the pelvis.

556
00:32:33,001 --> 00:32:34,401
Dr. Murphy.

557
00:32:34,403 --> 00:32:36,002
Your stat cultures came back positive

558
00:32:36,004 --> 00:32:39,039
for ichthyophthirius multifiliis.

559
00:32:39,041 --> 00:32:40,507
Thank you.

560
00:32:44,011 --> 00:32:47,347
It's not for this patient.

561
00:32:47,349 --> 00:32:49,116
Do you need to deal with it?

562
00:32:49,118 --> 00:32:51,051
It's too late.

563
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:42,969
You have a security problem.

564
00:33:42,971 --> 00:33:45,205
I will get my badge and my gun.

565
00:33:45,207 --> 00:33:48,575
Somebody stole my wallet
out of the locker.

566
00:33:49,844 --> 00:33:51,144
Are you sure you left it there?

567
00:33:51,146 --> 00:33:53,313
Yes. I'm sure.

568
00:34:02,456 --> 00:34:04,191
You were worried about it getting stolen,

569
00:34:04,193 --> 00:34:07,694
so you gave this to me
before your session today.

570
00:34:10,499 --> 00:34:12,265
Mine.

571
00:34:12,267 --> 00:34:13,967
Sorry.

572
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:15,703
Stupid.

573
00:34:16,371 --> 00:34:18,205
Don't read anything into this.

574
00:34:28,349 --> 00:34:29,883
Uh, how is she?

575
00:34:29,885 --> 00:34:31,551
We removed a lot of the tumor

576
00:34:31,553 --> 00:34:33,320
and she's having the
chemotherapy bath now.

577
00:34:33,322 --> 00:34:35,288
- Mm-hmm.
- So far, she's doing well.

578
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:37,624
Oh. Okay.

579
00:34:37,626 --> 00:34:39,593
- Kayla would want you to eat.
- Yeah.

580
00:34:39,595 --> 00:34:40,694
- Yeah.
- Of course she would.

581
00:34:40,696 --> 00:34:42,162
She'd forget to eat herself.

582
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,901
Man, I-I really hate all...
all this waiting.

583
00:34:47,903 --> 00:34:50,136
Okay. Just sit.

584
00:34:50,138 --> 00:34:51,705
Breathe.

585
00:34:56,878 --> 00:34:59,289
Kayla's dealt with so much

586
00:35:00,148 --> 00:35:03,250
prodding and nausea,

587
00:35:03,252 --> 00:35:08,088
fatigue... and so much pain.

588
00:35:09,523 --> 00:35:11,614
I just wish she would let
me do something for her

589
00:35:11,616 --> 00:35:13,960
to make things easier.

590
00:35:17,499 --> 00:35:19,726
I want to protect my wife.

591
00:35:20,903 --> 00:35:24,104
Instead, I'm just sitting here,
waiting...

592
00:35:24,106 --> 00:35:26,706
waiting for her to die.

593
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:42,355
Dash, I'm sorry.

594
00:35:42,357 --> 00:35:44,691
- They need me back in the O.R.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

595
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:55,219
Push another 60 of lasix.

596
00:35:56,538 --> 00:35:58,238
MAP is 26.

597
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,973
She's in cardiopulmonary collapse.

598
00:36:06,584 --> 00:36:07,684
Second chest tube in.

599
00:36:07,686 --> 00:36:09,802
SATS are still dropping on 100%.

600
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,000
It has to be heart failure.

601
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,201
We need to crash her onto ECMO.

602
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:13,669
Her cardiac index was fine.

603
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:15,905
It must be toxic inflammatory
reaction to the chemo.

604
00:36:15,907 --> 00:36:17,673
She's intolerant.

605
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:18,874
Stop the chemo.

606
00:36:24,716 --> 00:36:27,617
What if the fluid buildup isn't
a reaction to the chemo bath?

607
00:36:27,619 --> 00:36:29,518
What if it <i>is the chemo bath?</i>

608
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:32,922
Her... Her mediastinum is widening.

609
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:34,523
If her diaphragm perforated,

610
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:37,026
fluid could be leaking into her
chest, compressing her heart.

611
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:39,462
The tumor we removed yesterday
was clinging to her diaphragm.

612
00:36:39,464 --> 00:36:42,265
If we close the hole,
she can finish her treatment.

613
00:36:44,468 --> 00:36:46,335
Let's re-open her incision.

614
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:04,920
I just wanted to see how you were doing.

615
00:37:07,724 --> 00:37:10,159
His kidney numbers
are starting to improve.

616
00:37:12,896 --> 00:37:14,630
Take me back to my room, Doc.

617
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:22,265
Manny... thanks for the kidney.

618
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,840
You're welcome.

619
00:37:24,842 --> 00:37:26,075
Just don't come looking for another one

620
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,895
without a big check in your hand.

621
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,413
Jerk.

622
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:49,432
That's good.

623
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:53,302
Hey. You're just in time for
some, uh, celebratory ice chips.

624
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,741
- Kay, I'm sorry...
- Don't be.

625
00:37:58,743 --> 00:38:00,910
You weren't entirely wrong.

626
00:38:00,912 --> 00:38:05,514
I... I can be a little manipulative.

627
00:38:05,516 --> 00:38:06,851
No.

628
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:09,251
No, I was wrong.

629
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:14,256
You don't try to control everything

630
00:38:14,258 --> 00:38:16,986
because you think you know
better than everyone else.

631
00:38:17,695 --> 00:38:20,490
You do it because you're a caring friend.

632
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:26,001
You focus all your energy

633
00:38:26,003 --> 00:38:29,457
trying to protect us from
pain and suffering, and...

634
00:38:32,009 --> 00:38:35,077
and that lets you not
think about your own.

635
00:38:39,149 --> 00:38:40,583
But you have to.

636
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:50,893
You are dying, Kayla.

637
00:38:52,329 --> 00:38:53,763
I know.

638
00:38:56,266 --> 00:38:57,777
You're dying...

639
00:38:58,469 --> 00:39:01,904
and it is not fair.

640
00:39:03,707 --> 00:39:07,143
And it is painful and scary.

641
00:39:07,145 --> 00:39:09,512
And it feels like you're
all alone with it.

642
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:12,047
- Please, stop.
- But you're not.

643
00:39:15,318 --> 00:39:17,386
Dash is here.

644
00:39:22,226 --> 00:39:24,260
So am I.

645
00:39:50,754 --> 00:39:53,989
Thank you for everything you did.

646
00:39:53,991 --> 00:39:55,543
Of course.

647
00:39:56,260 --> 00:40:00,196
I, um... I meant what I said to Kayla.

648
00:40:00,198 --> 00:40:02,064
You really are the most gifted surgeon

649
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:03,365
I have ever worked with.

650
00:40:08,205 --> 00:40:10,139
You did well today.

651
00:40:11,434 --> 00:40:12,810
Thanks.

652
00:40:13,544 --> 00:40:15,511
I'll report back to
Dr. Lim in the morning

653
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:16,846
if that's what you want.

654
00:40:21,485 --> 00:40:23,953
Yeah, that's probably for the best.

655
00:40:33,631 --> 00:40:35,664
Shaun, I don't need another fish.

656
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:37,867
- I don't want another fish.
- I do.

657
00:40:37,869 --> 00:40:39,635
Our goldfish died.

658
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:42,671
You need to provide a replacement.

659
00:40:42,673 --> 00:40:44,974
Store policy... once a fish
leaves this store,

660
00:40:44,976 --> 00:40:47,176
all responsibility for
its well-being falls up...

661
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:51,847
Hubert had ichthyophthirius multifiliis,

662
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:56,118
a common goldfish parasite
picked up in pet stores.

663
00:40:59,155 --> 00:41:03,325
You have no leverage
and no cards to play.

664
00:41:13,704 --> 00:41:15,337
Pick a fish.

665
00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:27,950
You didn't kill Hubert.

666
00:41:27,952 --> 00:41:31,353
He was defective.

667
00:41:31,355 --> 00:41:33,088
We'll try again.

668
00:41:35,058 --> 00:41:37,726
Thank you, Shaun.

669
00:41:40,464 --> 00:41:43,599
Caring for a fish won't
sort out my problems.

670
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:49,738
That one's pretty cute.

671
00:41:50,908 --> 00:41:53,442
Platies are a very hardy fish.

672
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:55,678
They are difficult to kill.

673
00:42:10,409 --> 00:42:18,413
