DR. MELENDEZ: Hmm.

172
00:09:09,182 --> 00:09:10,718
The CT scan showed...

173
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:13,253
The segment we removed
was displacing the diaphragm
upward,

174
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,088
giving the appearance
of chest infiltration.

If the cancer's
just in her abdomen,

she could be a candidate
for HIPEC treatment.

DR. MELENDEZ:
It's called HIPEC surgery.

182
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:39,680
I'd remove as much
tumor as possible,

183
00:09:39,747 --> 00:09:40,781
and then we'd infuse
your abdomen

with a chemotherapy
solution for 90 minutes.

This is a major operation,
and your body's frail.

navigate inside your abdomen.

I told her not to do that.

319
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:15,542
I mean, it's, uh...

320
00:16:15,608 --> 00:16:17,044
(CHUCKLING)
It's nuts, you know?

321
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:19,279
Well,
that's a little insulting.

322
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,548
Uh...

323
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:25,218
(LAUGHS)
I'm kidding.
It's insane.

324
00:16:25,285 --> 00:16:26,353
(BOTH LAUGH)

325
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:28,488
Uh... Just, you know...

326
00:16:28,555 --> 00:16:30,457
We'll just forget
she mentioned it, okay?

327
00:16:31,624 --> 00:16:32,825
Will she?

328
00:16:32,892 --> 00:16:36,496
I mean,
we've both said no.
What's she gonna do?

329
00:16:36,563 --> 00:16:38,131
You've been married
to her eight years.

330
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:39,666
You still ask
that question?

331
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:44,171
Well, we, uh,
do have one other choice.

332
00:16:46,273 --> 00:16:47,507
You guys have
a chapel here, right?

333
00:16:47,574 --> 00:16:49,742
(BOTH LAUGH)

334
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:51,578
He's exploiting
this situation.

335
00:16:51,644 --> 00:16:53,513
Yes. He's entitled to.

336
00:16:55,182 --> 00:16:56,783
You don't think
an organ donation

337
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,785
should be an
altruistic act?

338
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,520
Can it be?

339
00:17:00,587 --> 00:17:04,791
A majority of donors do it
to make their own lives
more worthwhile,

340
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,126
and almost
a quarter do it

341
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:08,328
to relieve guilt
over a past mistake.

342
00:17:08,395 --> 00:17:12,265
Redemption, meaning,
sure, but not money.

343
00:17:12,332 --> 00:17:15,735
So, you never take
an opportunity to get ahead
at someone else's expense?

344
00:17:15,802 --> 00:17:18,438
I'm competing,
not trafficking organs.

345
00:17:18,505 --> 00:17:19,906
I need Armando's kidney.

346
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:22,542
And I need it without
getting dragged into
their family drama,

347
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:23,810
which is why
I have residents.

348
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,412
So you two find a way
to make it happen.

349
00:17:29,616 --> 00:17:33,720
This central line will
allow us to monitor your heart
during tomorrow's surgery.

350
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:37,457
Have you considered
my proposal?

351
00:17:37,524 --> 00:17:42,595
I have been more focused
on your surgery
than seducing your husband.

352
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:44,331
(LAUGHS)
Typical.

353
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:45,965
Ah. You got me.

354
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:49,436
I'm not dating
my cancer-riddled
friend's husband

355
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:51,104
because I have
commitment issues.

356
00:17:51,171 --> 00:17:53,806
You've been sprinting
away from men
as long as I've known you.

357
00:17:53,873 --> 00:17:55,108
Yeah.

358
00:17:55,175 --> 00:17:57,177
I will find the time
when I have the time.

359
00:17:57,244 --> 00:17:58,811
It will never be
the right time.

360
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:01,414
You're afraid
to get hurt.

361
00:18:04,217 --> 00:18:06,686
I know how short life is.

362
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:09,222
I don't want you to miss out
on the best part of it.

363
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:10,523
All done.

364
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,525
What do I owe you for
the therapy session?

365
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:13,860
Date my husband.

366
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,828
Do you know how stupid
that sounds?

367
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:18,498
I want someone to take care
of the man that I love.

368
00:18:18,565 --> 00:18:21,301
Does that sound stupid?
Yes, very, but...

369
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,237
Please.

370
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:25,838
Please, would you
just drop this?

371
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,243
I will drop this.
If... One date.

372
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:32,779
One dinner. That's all.

373
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:36,183
But a real one,
not a latte in the cafe.

374
00:18:36,249 --> 00:18:40,052
I want a real date.
Appetizers, main course,
wine.

375
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,422
I'm on call.
No wine. But candles.

376
00:18:42,489 --> 00:18:44,524
I want candles.
(GROANS)

377
00:18:44,591 --> 00:18:47,260
One date.
I will never mention
any of this again.

378
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:53,966
It's a federal crime to
barter a human organ
for anything of value.

379
00:18:54,033 --> 00:18:55,735
I'm not selling
Santiago anything.

380
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:59,272
You're receiving money
from a third party
in exchange for your kidney.

381
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:02,842
He's receiving money
from a third party
for his business.

382
00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:03,976
So is his brother.

383
00:19:04,043 --> 00:19:05,678
He should love him
enough to not...

384
00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:07,180
I love him enough
to give him a kidney.

385
00:19:07,247 --> 00:19:08,748
He should love me enough
to accept an offer

386
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:10,417
that would improve
my life, too.

387
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:12,685
I mean, it's a much lower
ask than a vital organ.

388
00:19:12,752 --> 00:19:14,454
You're not allowed
to ask for anything.

389
00:19:14,521 --> 00:19:15,555
Are you saying
that if he agrees

390
00:19:15,622 --> 00:19:16,889
you're not gonna
perform the surgery?

391
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:18,358
He doesn't agree.
He will.

392
00:19:18,425 --> 00:19:19,626
Everything in life
is transactional,

393
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:21,894
and in this case,
I've got all the leverage.

394
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:24,997
Leverage?
It's what you have
that they need.

395
00:19:25,064 --> 00:19:27,700
It's how you shift a deal
in your favor.

396
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:30,237
You guys have no leverage
and no cards to play.

397
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:32,472
Yes, we do.

398
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:35,742
I don't believe you're willing
to let your brother die.

399
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:37,844
A good negotiator
doesn't bluff.

400
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,879
If you cave on a threat,
you lose all credibility.

401
00:19:39,946 --> 00:19:42,382
And Santiago knows
I'm a good negotiator.

402
00:19:42,449 --> 00:19:44,251
So he won't die

403
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:46,152
precisely because
I'm willing to let him.

404
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:52,725
I'll talk to
your brother.

405

it was a bad idea.

Hubert is dead.

That's odd.

480
00:24:01,874 --> 00:24:03,810
I'm not sure
if I overfed him

481
00:24:03,876 --> 00:24:06,613
or if it was when I changed
the water to clean
his pebbles,

482
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:09,381

definitely dead.
