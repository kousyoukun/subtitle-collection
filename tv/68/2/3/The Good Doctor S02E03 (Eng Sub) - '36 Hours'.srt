You don't want to tear the masseter.

Well, Dr. Browne,
I've also thought about it.

In fact, when the new ACGME
guidelines were released,

00:08:30,027 --> 00:08:33,106
I joined a nationwide study
analyzing a flextime schedule.

191
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:36,876
It found that as long as a weekly
max of 80 hours is adhered to,

192
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,813
patient outcomes and resident
satisfaction scores are better

than at hospitals with a daily max.

194
00:08:42,573 --> 00:08:44,751
So we're just going to
have to agree to disagree
