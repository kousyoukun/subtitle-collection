CLAIRE:
It doesn't make any sense.

176
00:07:58,278 --> 00:08:00,781
We are the only hospital
on the West Coast

177
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:03,150
that hasn't adopted
the ACGME mandate

178

on a 24-hour
max shift length.

179
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:08,188
And numerous studies
have shown
the negative effects

180
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:10,558
that sleep deprivation has
on critical thinking,

181
00:08:10,591 --> 00:08:12,492
which can cause residents
to make mistakes

182
00:08:12,526 --> 00:08:15,462
that not only harm patients,
but that waste money.

183
00:08:16,964 --> 00:08:18,932
You've done your homework.

184
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:21,635
Um, it's something
I've been thinking
about for a long time.

185
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:23,771
I actually did a paper on it
at med school.

186
00:08:23,804 --> 00:08:27,641
Well, Dr. Browne,
I've also thought about it.

187
00:08:27,675 --> 00:08:30,744
In fact, when the new ACGME
guidelines were released,

188
00:08:30,778 --> 00:08:33,847
I joined a nationwide study
analyzing a flextime schedule.

189
00:08:33,881 --> 00:08:37,618
It found that as long
as a weekly max of 80 hours
is adhered to,

190
00:08:37,651 --> 00:08:40,387
patient outcomes and resident
satisfaction scores are better

191
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,856
than at hospitals
with a daily max.

192
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:45,058
So we're just going
to have to
agree to disagree

193
00:08:45,092 --> 00:08:48,195
about whether my foolish
new policies "make any sense."

194
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:49,396
No, I didn't say...

195
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:51,164
And I know I told you
to be more assertive.

196
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,802
But you also need to make sure
that you don't forsake

197
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:57,871
your normally
excellent judgment
in that effort.

Oh, my case was called.

You said I could have

took a five-minute break.

DR. MELENDEZ:
Make a stab incision
with an 11 blade,

209
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:29,569
and I'll insert the Veress.

He'll get over it.
Don't worry.

Andrews just likes to hammer
a nail every now and then.

212
00:09:39,046 --> 00:09:42,015
I didn't call him a fool.
I just said his policy
didn't make sense.

DR. PARK: You said
it didn't make sense,

216
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:54,628
and he explained that
in his opinion it did.

217
00:09:54,662 --> 00:09:55,729
What's the problem?

218
00:09:55,763 --> 00:09:58,598
The problem is men who tell
women to be assertive,

219
00:09:58,632 --> 00:10:01,101
then as soon as we are,
they criticize us for it.

220
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:02,903
We're the bitch.

221
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,072
You didn't call him a fool.
He didn't call you a bitch.

222
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,339
Not to her face.

223
00:10:08,642 --> 00:10:11,278
DR. PARK: He just suggested
she choose her words
more carefully.

224
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:14,782
So, women have to be assertive
but careful?

225
00:10:14,815 --> 00:10:17,417
When you're talking to your
boss, yes. Everyone does.

226
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,887
DR. MELENDEZ:
If you're all done debating,
this boss could use some help.

227
00:10:25,058 --> 00:10:26,126
You see that?

228
00:10:27,828 --> 00:10:29,897
There are lesions
on her ovary.

229
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,932
That wasn't visible
on the imaging.

230
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,466
DR. MELENDEZ: It's small.

231
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,635
We can excise it without
damaging the ovary, but...

232
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:37,537
There are others.

233
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:41,408
Her bowel, bladder, uterus.

234
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:43,243
No wonder she's been
in so much pain.

235

DR. MELENDEZ: We'll start
with the Fallopian lesions
and just go one by one.

and brief the husband.

Why me?
Why not Park?

239
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:01,294
Because I think you're
better at talking
to anxious relatives.

Just one of those days.

247
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:29,456
I didn't mean one
of "those" days.

248

of the bed sometimes.

Dr. Browne
explained exactly why
she was "on edge."

251
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:37,865
Did you forget already,

252
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:40,200
or were you just not listening
to begin with?

Excuse me?

254

We should cut back
on the conversation

and don't make it a Picasso.

On it.

Uh, the bleeding's
under control.

DR. PARK: What about
her bladder?

476
00:22:57,777 --> 00:22:59,479
There's infiltrating lesions
all over it.

are involved.

a urostomy bag?

There has to be
another option.

If I had another option,
Nurse Flores,
I would've suggested it.

483

What if we excise part
of her bowel,
reconstruct a bladder?

484
00:23:31,578 --> 00:23:33,012
That's a lot more
dangerous than...

00:23:36,716 --> 00:23:38,384
I think the additional risk
is worth it.

488

Okay. I'll go.
No, Park will.

That's even...
Bigger than it was last time.

499

Winter's procedure requires
an extra-large-gauge needle

to restore blood flow.

it was worth it before, too.

to do this right now!

We do. I just need to

No.

Don't lie.
You're not good at it.

I saw you delete
her text.

I knew Glassman
didn't give you
the Winter's idea.

514
00:24:49,622 --> 00:24:52,659
The text wasn't
from Dr. Lim.
It was from Lea.

515
00:24:52,692 --> 00:24:55,628
If it was from Lea,
then why'd
you delete it so fast?

Claire thinks I shouldn't
push a good friend away,

I don't want to talk
to her.

You shouldn't listen
to them.

Lea and Claire
are nice to you.

But...they're not
your friends.

it was a pity kiss.

You've never even met Lea.

530
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:46,478
True.

531
00:25:46,512 --> 00:25:48,214
But I know that she's not
in middle school,

532
00:25:48,247 --> 00:25:50,883
which means if she really
thought of you as a man,

533
00:25:50,917 --> 00:25:53,552
she wouldn't have settled
for just one innocent peck.

Hey, Shaun.

538
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:44,170
What's going on? I thought
I couldn't be released
until I was arraigned.

539
00:26:44,203 --> 00:26:46,906
The judge decided nine hours
was enough punishment.

540
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:49,441
She's the one
who should be punished.
I should sue her.

541
00:26:49,475 --> 00:26:52,278
What you should do is learn
to keep your mouth shut.

542
00:26:55,882 --> 00:26:57,583
You're lucky I'm hungry.

We need to work together.

00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:03,856
CLAIRE: We are.

546
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:05,958
That's how we came up with the
idea to rebuild her bladder.

547
00:27:05,992 --> 00:27:08,427
There's a way to offer
your input without
undermining my authority.

548
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,329
The only thing that undermines
your authority

549
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:12,732
is your comments about
Dr. Browne's supposed PMS.

550
00:27:12,765 --> 00:27:15,301
What?
I never said you had PMS.

551
00:27:15,334 --> 00:27:16,803
I just asked Park
if he knew

552
00:27:16,836 --> 00:27:18,337
why you were
more irritable than usual.

553
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,272
I'm not irritable,
and I'm not a whiner!

554
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:21,507
I never said you were...

555
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,609
You told me to take it up with
Andrews. This was your idea.

556
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:24,944
If anyone's a whiner,
it's you.

557
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:26,612
DR. ANDREWS: That's enough.

558
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:28,447
You're 12 hours
into an operation

559
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,482
you thought
was gonna take one,
so I think it's safe to say

560
00:27:30,516 --> 00:27:31,951
you're all more irritable
than usual.

561
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:34,620
But you need to get a grip.

562
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,488
Dr. Melendez, maybe it's time
you took a little break.

563
00:27:36,522 --> 00:27:38,524
Get an energy bar
and some juice.

564
00:27:38,557 --> 00:27:39,625
I don't need a...

565
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:40,693
Do it anyway.

566
00:27:45,031 --> 00:27:47,800
And when he gets back,
I expect everyone in this OR

567
00:27:47,834 --> 00:27:50,302
to conduct themselves with
the utmost professionalism.

568
00:27:52,705 --> 00:27:54,473
Can I get
two brisket tacos, please?

She's out of order!

574
00:28:03,482 --> 00:28:07,619
This whole traffic court
hearing is out of order!

575
00:28:07,653 --> 00:28:09,655
Okay,

576
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:11,824

I gotta give you props.

about the LIDAR calibration.

gonna appeal.

This flextime schedule

But if this penis had been
passed on to the next shift,

they would've assumed
you missed something,

00:40:05,804 --> 00:40:08,073
I shouldn't have
told you to go away.

783
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:13,579
It wasn't very nice
and you've always
been nice to me.

784
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:18,550
You've been a good friend.

785
00:40:22,854 --> 00:40:25,591
If you want to talk,
I will listen.

786
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,394
**

787
00:40:30,896 --> 00:40:34,733
You're right.
I have been a good friend.

788
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:37,435
Actually, I've been
an awesome friend,

789
00:40:37,469 --> 00:40:38,870
but you have been
a total jerk!

790
00:40:39,905 --> 00:40:42,373
You are so worried
about me hurting you?

791
00:40:42,407 --> 00:40:43,875
What about
how you hurt me?

792
00:40:43,909 --> 00:40:46,077
What? You think you're
the only one who has feelings?

793
00:40:46,111 --> 00:40:48,279
You think you're the only one
who needs someone

794
00:40:48,313 --> 00:40:51,082
who doesn't judge them,
doesn't make them feel
totally alone,

795
00:40:51,116 --> 00:40:52,684
like there's not one person
in the world

796
00:40:52,718 --> 00:40:53,952
who actually gives
a damn about them?

797
00:40:53,985 --> 00:40:55,220
Okay. I'm sorry.

798
00:40:55,253 --> 00:40:56,321
No, you're not!

799
00:40:56,354 --> 00:40:57,856
You're... You're just
uncomfortable

800
00:40:57,889 --> 00:40:59,257
and you're trying to
get me to shut up.

801
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,391
Which, don't worry, I will.

802
00:41:00,425 --> 00:41:01,760
Just as soon as I finish
telling you

803
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:03,862
that friendship
is a two-way street, Shaun!

804
00:41:03,895 --> 00:41:05,964
A two-way street,
you jackass!

805
00:41:10,168 --> 00:41:11,537
Guess I was wrong.

806
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:13,171
She does think of you
like a real man.

807
00:41:14,005 --> 00:41:16,274
**

808
00:41:30,188 --> 00:41:31,590
WOMAN:
Are you awake?

809
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,394
Hi, Daddy.

810
00:41:41,366 --> 00:41:42,701
Maddie?

811
00:41:47,472 --> 00:41:48,707
How are you feeling?

812
00:41:52,878 --> 00:41:54,479
It's so good
to see you.

813
00:41:56,481 --> 00:41:57,783
You're dead.

814
00:41:58,617 --> 00:42:00,051
Don't you think
I know that?

815
00:42:02,087 --> 00:42:03,354
Am I dead?

816
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:08,026
No, dummy.
You're just tired.

817
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,329
**

818
00:42:25,844 --> 00:42:27,879
