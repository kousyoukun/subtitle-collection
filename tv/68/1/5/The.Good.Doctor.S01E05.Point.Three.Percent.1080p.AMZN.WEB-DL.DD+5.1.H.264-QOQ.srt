「良医」前情回顾
Previously on "The Good Doctor"...

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:06,760
表现得像个普通人能有多难
How hard can it be to just act like a normal human being?!

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:07,510
不
No!

4
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:09,790
你能别玩你那破兔子了吗
Stop petting that stupid rabbit!

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,320
我们再也不会回家了
We're never going home again.

6
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:13,170
我们有彼此  这就够了
We have each other, and that's all we need.

7
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:16,670
我的弟弟在我眼前去了天堂
My brother went to heaven in front of my eyes.

8
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:19,930
永远记住  你是最聪明的
Never forget, you're the smart one.

9
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:21,420
我为你骄傲  肖恩
And I'm proud of you, Shaun.

10
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:28,500
爸
Dad?

11
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:38,060
潘妮  我也好想你
Penny, I missed you, too!

12
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:39,190
潘妮  过来
Oh, Penny, come.

13
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,030
坐好
Stay.

14
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:43,070
爸
Hey, Dad.

15
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,600
抱歉这么早过来  我刚下飞机
Sorry it's so early. I just landed.

16
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,300
其实你来得有点晚
Actually, you're a bit late.

17
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:49,690
晚了五星期
Five weeks.

18
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,140
我知道
I know. I know.

19
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,590
很抱歉  说来话长  好吗
I'm sorry. I-i-it's a long story, okay?

20
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,710
当时的情况如何
But h-how was it?

21
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,790
那可是你母亲的葬礼
It was your mother's funeral.

22
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,280
爸  我...
Dad, I'm...

23
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:16,100
好了
Okay.

24
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,750
你有我的电话
Well, you have my cell number.

25
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,700
你得接电话才行啊
It only works if you answer it.

26
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,650
爸
Dad?

27
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:31,030
爸
Dad?!

28
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:33,420
爸
Dad!

29
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,480
你还好吗
You okay?

30
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,070
还好吗  不能呼吸吗
You okay? You can't breathe?!

31
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:37,950
不能  好
No? Okay.

32
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,240
坚持住  我报警求救
Hold on, I'm gonna call for help, okay?

33
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:42,570
911吗  我爸晕倒了
911? My dad collapsed!

34
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,310
他不能呼吸  拜托快点来
He can't -- he can't breathe, please hurry!

35
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,670
坚持住  爸
Just hold on, Dad!

36
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:54,360
早上好  各位
Good morning, everyone!

37
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:55,790
真准时
Right on time.

38
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:58,290
你是睡这了  还是用了任意门
What, did you sleep here or use a teleportation device?

39
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,520
我用了任意门
I used a teleportation device.

40
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:05,940
无意义的问题通常暗含讽刺
Nonsensical questions usually imply sarcasm,

41
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:08,520
我发现人们通常也以讽刺回答
which I've found people often answer sarcastically.

42
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:09,380
真棒
Good one.

43
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:12,450
创伤科请求会诊  患者为66岁男性
Trauma wants a consult on a 66-year-old male

44
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:14,700
因严重过敏导致晕倒
who collapsed from severe anaphylaxis,

45
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,750
同时伴有呼吸停止
complicated by respiratory arrest.

46
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,290
他儿子刚从泰国回来
His son just got back from Thailand.

47
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,870
这位父亲就马上过敏发作了
Almost immediately, the father had his allergic reaction.

48
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:24,240
患者有一些过敏原
Patient has a few allergies --

49
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,670
花粉  霉菌  贝类
pollen, mold, shellfish --

50
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:27,550
但没发现明显的相关过敏原
but no corresponding allergens were in evidence.

51
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:30,200
为什么要给过敏患者做外科会诊
Why are we doing a surgical consult on an allergy?

52
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:30,970
我们没有
Well, we're not.

53
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:34,550
会诊针对的是他现在的腹部剧痛
We're doing a consult on the excruciating abdominal pain he now has.

54
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,160
你也听到了
As you may have heard.

55
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:42,280
威尔克斯先生  我是尼尔·梅伦德斯医生
Mr. Wilks, hi, I'm Dr. Neil Melendez.

56
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,740
听说你腹部疼痛
Heard you had some abdominal pain.

57
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:50,650

他疼得很厉害
The guy was in some serious pain --

76
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,210
需要注射十毫克吗啡的程度
10 milligrams of morphine worth.

检查结果显示脂肪酶
Test results show elevated lipase,

79
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,010
淀粉酶和胰蛋白都增高了
amylase, pancreatic enzymes.

80
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,200
胰腺增大
Pancreas is enlarged.

81
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,860
可能是酒精诱发的胰腺炎
Could be pancreatitis, maybe alcohol-induced.

82
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,340
儿子说早上六点就在他父亲身上闻到了酒气
The son said he smelled alcohol on his father 6:00 in the morning.

83
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:36,990
过敏性反应是胰腺炎诱发的症状
And anaphylaxis has been known to precipitate attacks of pancreatitis.

84
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:38,210
大概就是这样了
Guess that's it, then.

85
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,330
看来你不认同
Meaning you totally disagree.

86
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:44,300
不是谁都会一大早就喝巴克泡腾酒
Not everyone who starts their day off with a Mimosa

87
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,630
折腾坏自己的胰腺
fries their pancreas.

88
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,120
你的眼神肯定比我好多了
Your eyesight must a hell of a lot better than mine.

89
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,090
由于肠道气体的覆盖
Because I can't see the entire pancreas

90
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:51,610
我可没看到完整的胰腺
due to the overlying bowel gas.

91
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,750
预约腹部CT  好好看清楚
We'll order an abdominal CT and take a better look.

92
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,610
这就对了
There you go.

93
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,610
莫菲去哪儿了
Where the hell is Murphy?

94
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:03,110
骨折很严重  但不需要钢钉
It's a severe fracture, but I don't think you'll need pins.

95
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,170
年轻人的骨头愈合能力很好
Young bones tend to heal very well.

96
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:06,070
「年轻人的骨头」
Young Bones?

97
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:08,610
那不是「星际迷航: 原初」的漫画小说吗
Isn't that a "Star Trek: Origins" graphic novel?

98
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:12,460
我不知道
I'm not sure.

99
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:15,390
不  我开玩笑的
No, that was a joke.

100
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,800
你的父母在哪儿
Where are your parents?

101
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,740
他们在路上了
They're coming.

102
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:20,240
他们在市里上班  所以开过来有点远
They both work in the city, so it's a long drive for them.

103
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:22,130
我本来在参加野外考察
I was on a school field trip,

104
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,860
结果自己绊倒了
and I tripped over my own feet.

105
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,580
竟然正好摔在谢尔比·洛马尔面前
Of course, it was right in front of Shelby Lomar.

106
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,990
至少样子非常狼狈
At least it was pretty gross,

107
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:30,300
所以我起码得了点同情分
so I got some sympathy points for that.

108
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:36,730
我还以为你的骨折是由更严重的事故造成的
I would expect this to have been caused by a more serious accident.

109
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:37,790
不  就是绊倒了
Nope, just a trip.

110
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:38,950
我经常绊倒
I do that a lot.

111
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:39,980
我也很无奈
What can I say?

112
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,000
我笨手笨脚的
I'm clumsy.

113
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:43,480
好  盯着我的手指
Yes. Now follow my finger.

114
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:53,550
你有点眼球震颤和不自主眼运动
You have some nystagmus -- an involuntary eye movement.

115
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:55,190
什么意思
So what's that mean?

116
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,500
你摔倒时伤到头了吗
When you fell, did you hit your head?

117
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:58,300
没有
No.

118
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,070
你觉得我有脑损伤吗
What, you think I have brain damage?

119
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:02,940
眼球震颤可能是神经系统问题的症状
Nystagmus can be a sign of a neurological issue.

120
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:06,340
难怪我在社会调研里只得了C
Well, that would explain the "C" I got in social studies.

121
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,810
你又在开玩笑吧
That was another joke, wasn't it?

122
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,430
我去给你预约脑部CT
I'm going to order a head CT for you.

123
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,280
去吧
Go for it.

124
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:21,730
-肖恩  你睡觉了吗  -睡了
- Shaun, are you getting any sleep? - Yes.

125
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:23,760
是吗  真的睡觉了吗
Really? I mean, really getting sleep?

126
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,060
我准时到了医院
I got here on time.

127
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,050
那很好
Well, that's good.

128
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:28,160
我用了任意门
I used a teleportation device.

129
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,890
麻烦给我放射科表单
Radiology form, please.

130
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,760
肖恩  那个男孩看起来很像...
Shaun, that boy, he looks like...

131
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,790
史蒂夫  没错
Steve. He does.

132
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:45,550
他们有血缘关系吗
Is he related?

133
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,910
他叫埃文·格里克  应该没有
His name is Evan Gallico, so I don't think so.

134
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,820
这太不可思议了
That is uncanny.

135
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,230
只是巧合而已
Just coincidental.

136
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:56,510
他跟你弟弟简直一模一样
He looks exactly like your brother.

137
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,340
并不是完全一样
No, he doesn't.

138
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,760
他的头发短一些
His hair is shorter.

139
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:01,600
我被吓到了  你没被吓到吗
It freaks me out. It doesn't freak you out?

140
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,360
没有
No.

141
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,120
吓到了也没关系
It's okay if it does --

142
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,460
不  他不是史蒂夫  史蒂夫已经死了
No, he's not Steve. Steve's dead.

143
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:12,720
我说「我用了任意门」是玩笑话
"I used a teleportation device" was a joke.

144
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,810
那...很好
Yeah, that's...that's good.

145
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:30,440
我没能参加妈妈的葬礼是因为我恋爱了
So, I couldn't come to Mom's funeral because I fell in love.

146
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,960
她也是学校里的老师
She was another teacher at the school.

147
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,290
一个泰国女人
A Thai woman.

148
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,670
她很善良
And she was kind and --

149
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:40,330
美丽  有爱心...
and beautiful and loving...

150
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,660
但病得很重
and very, very sick.

151
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,310
她有先天性心脏缺损
She had a congenital heart defect.

152
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,450
如果你不愿意告诉我
Look, if you don't want to tell me

153
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:58,630
这六个月你去哪里了  那就别说
where you've been for the last six months, then don't.

154
00:06:58,630 --> 00:06:59,590
这是你的事
It's your business.

155
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:01,390
但是别侮辱我的智商
But don't insult my intelligence.

156
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,710
我不能丢下她
Well, I couldn't just leave her.

157
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:05,520
你连花五分钟打个电话的时间都没有吗
You couldn't leave her for five minutes to make a phone call?

158
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,660
打扰到你们了吗
This a bad time?

159
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,750
没有  请进
No, come in.

160
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:19,610
CT结果显示  你的胰腺有病变
According to the CT, you have a lesion on your pancreas.

161
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:21,180
可能是什么病变
Well, what do you think this lesion could be?

162
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,090
还不确定
Not sure.

163
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,650
所以我们需要做病理切片检查
That's why we need to biopsy it.

164
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:25,990
可能只是个良性囊肿
It could just be a benign cyst.

165
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:26,810
或者
Or...?

166
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:27,530
或者
Or...

167
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:31,180
可能是癌症  对吗
it could be cancer, right?

168
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:33,730
我们很快就能知道了
We'll know soon enough.

169
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,500
这很快的
This won't take long.

170
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:54,670
我知道  我已经做过两次了
I know. I've had two of these.

171
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:56,590
再来一次我就能有童军勋章了
One more and I get my Scout badge.

172
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,760
这很好笑
That was funny.

173
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,420
没看到你的表情  很难说
Tough to tell without looking at you,

174
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,660
但我猜你在讽刺我
but I'm guessing that was sarcasm.

175
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,100
不是  我有自闭症
No. I have autism,

176
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,840
因此我很难读懂社交暗示
which makes it hard for me to read social cues.

177
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,430
我也无法理解笑话
Jokes are difficult.

178
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:15,040
我以前认识一个有自闭症的小孩  皮特
I used to know a kid with autism. Peter.

179
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,390
他有点奇怪  但是人非常好
He was kind of weird but super nice.

180
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,010
以前认识
Used to know?

181
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:22,090
你现在不认识他了吗
You don't know him anymore?

182
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,170
他去世了
He died.

183
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,950
出了车祸
Hit by a car.

184
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,680
你有朋友去世吗
You know anyone who died?

185
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,830
我的弟弟
My brother.

186
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:31,490
真糟糕
That sucks.

187
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:37,260
你为什么做那么多CT扫描
Why did you have the other CT scans?

188
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,720
我的父母有...
My parents have...

189
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,680
你们把害怕生病称作什么
uh, what's the word for fear of getting sick?

190
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,500
疑病症
Hypochondriasis?

191
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,310
不是  比这个更严重
no, worse than that.

192
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:48,130
他们有患病恐怖症
They have...nosophobia.

193
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:49,330
我喜欢那个词
I love that word.

194
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,420
你觉得甘尼特小姐怎么样
What do you think of Miss Gannett?

195
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:53,840
她很好
She's nice.

196
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:56,240
她臀很翘
I think she's callipygian.

197
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,050
她什么
She's what?

198
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,710
臀很翘
Callipygian?

199
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:02,630
意思是「臀部线条很美」  肖恩
It means "having shapely buttocks," Shaun.

200
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,860
你读了字典
You read the dictionary.

201
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,720
情节上缺什么  就在词汇上补回来
What it lacks in plot, it makes up for in vocab.

202
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,840
你结婚了吗
So, you married?

203
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:14,680
女朋友呢
Girlfriend?

204
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,020
男朋友
Boyfriend?

205
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,020
热带鱼
Tropical fish?

206
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:22,750
我喜欢莉亚
I like Lea.

207
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,700
莉亚是谁
And who's Lea?

208
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,270
莉亚是一个朋友
Lea is a friend.

209
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,820
可以约会的朋友
A friend you date?

210
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:30,060
可以打炮的朋友
A friend with benefits?

211
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:32,390
我偶尔借给她电池
I lend her batteries sometimes.

212
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,590
我喜欢这个进展
I like where this is going...

213
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,820
那就继续加油吧
So, you know, keep going.

214
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,750
如果你不加油  我会的
'Cause if you don't, I will.

215
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,970
我就是这样
It's kind of my thing, you know?

216
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:47,430
说起话来没完  骚扰所有人
Just constant talking -- annoys everyone.

217
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:50,210
-莫菲  -也不是所有人
- Murphy. - Well, I guess not everyone.

218
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,470
我的家人现在已经习惯了
My family's pretty used to me now. I mean...

219
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,730
我的朋友们也都是话痨  所以...
my friends are very talkative as well, so...

220
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:57,170
你给一个手臂骨折的人做脑CT
You're giving the fractured arm a head CT?

221
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:58,740
-是的  -去照顾那个胰腺患者吧
- Yes. - Get back to the pancreas.

222
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,670
他不是笨手笨脚
He's not clumsy.

223
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:02,310
他内耳附近有脑肿瘤
He has a brain tumor behind the inner ear.

224
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,050
别管胰腺患者了
Forget the pancreas.

225
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,000
格里克夫妇
Mr. And Mrs. Gallico?

226
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,980
我是肖恩·莫菲医生
I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.

227
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,160
我负责治疗您的儿子
I'm treating your son.

228
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:20,190
他怎么样了
Well, how is he?

229
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:21,640
我们听说摔得很严重
We were told it was a bad break,

230
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,280
但应该能完全康复
but it should heal no problem.

231
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,920
我知道埃文为什么摔倒了
I know why Evan tripped.

232
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:27,660
他左耳后侧的颞骨处有肿瘤
He had a tumor in the temporal bone behind his left ear,

233
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,290
影响了他的平衡功能
which is affecting his balance.

234
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:31,900
我安排了与肿瘤科纳吉德医生的会诊
I've arranged for a consult with Dr. Najid in oncology

235
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,210
-她会... -不用了  我们...
- and she's going... - No, that won't be necessary. We...

236
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,090
我们已经有肿瘤科医师了
We already have an oncologist.

237
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:41,800
埃文被确诊为晚期骨肉瘤
Evan's been diagnosed with stage four osteosarcoma.

238
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,280
他抱怨过胫骨痛
He was complaining of a sore shin.

239
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:48,010
我们最没想到的就是骨癌
The last thing that we expected was bone cancer.

240
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:51,850
旧金山市立医院的医生说他只能活一年
The doctors at SFM, they gave him a year to live.

241
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:56,540
七个月前说的
That was seven months ago.

242
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:01,120
骨肉瘤解释了他的骨折为什么这么严重
Osteosarcoma explains the severity of his fracture --

243
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,120
看来他还是需要钢钉固定
he will need pins in his arm after all.

244
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,860
我们可以去看看他吗
can we see him?

245
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:06,900
当然  他在414房间
Yes. He's in room 414.

246
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:08,650
莫菲医生
Dr. Murphy?

247
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:14,220
他不知道自己患了癌症
He doesn't know about his diagnosis.

248
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:18,490
我们想继续向他保密
We would really like to keep it that way.

249
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:28,810
他才是患者
He's the patient.

250
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:30,710
他没有权利知道真相吗
Doesn't he have the right to know the truth?

251
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:33,920
没有  他还未成年  所以没有权利
Well, no. He's also a minor, so, no, he doesn't.

252
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,360
埃文很聪明
Evan's very intelligent --

253
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,400
他承受得住
he'd be able to handle it.

254
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:39,050
肖恩  或许这不只关系到埃文
Well, Shaun, maybe it's not just about Evan.

255
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:41,650
或许也关系到他的父母
Maybe it's about his parents, as well.

256
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,810
或许他们现在无法向埃文开口
Maybe it's just too difficult for them to tell Evan right now.

257
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:46,630
我不清楚
I don't know.

258
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,280
那他父母才不应该知道真相
Then they're the ones who shouldn't be told.

259
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,800
我这么问你吧  肖恩
Well, let me ask you this, Shaun --

260
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,770
让埃文尽可能地享受
what's so wrong about Evan being allowed

261
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:55,030
他现在的生活有什么错
to enjoy as much of his life as possible?

262
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,220
埃文想知道真相
Evan wants to know the truth.

263
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,430
你怎么知道
How do you know that?

264
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,120
如果他是史蒂夫  是你弟弟
If this were Steve, if this were your brother,

265
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,140
他会想知道真相吗
would he want to know the truth?

266
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,530
是这样吗
Is that what this is?

267
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,680
爸爸总是这样
Dad's such a tool.

268
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,270
我在他的壁橱里发现了我的生日礼物
I found my birthday present in their closet,

269
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,490
他总把东西藏在那
right where they always hide it.

270
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,600
我正要拆开就被爸爸发现了  吓死我了
I was just about to open it when Dad caught me snooping and freaked out.

271
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,600
我讨厌那些虚假的惊喜
I hate all that phony surprise stuff.

272
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,670
那是个水雷水枪
It's an AquaBlast Water Cannon.

273
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,420
妈妈买的时候我也在
I was with Mom when she bought it.

274
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:33,370
多谢你  肖恩
Thank you, Shaun.

275
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,620
你的坦诚真是别具一格
Your honesty's refreshing!

276
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:41,010
没错  他想知道真相
Yes, he would want to know the truth.

277
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,740
我们对此都无能为力
Well, there's nothing we can do about it.

278
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:46,770
这不是你能做的决定  是他们的
It's not your decision -- it's theirs.

279
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:47,870
那是他们的儿子
He's their son.

280
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:04,980
克莱尔  我需要你帮忙
Claire, I need you.

281
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,340
当然  怎么了
Sure, what's up?

282
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,810
我需要有人替我撒谎
I need someone to lie for me.

283
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,130
好吧
Okay...

284
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,980
我真是受宠若惊
I'm flattered?

285
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:21,660
医生
Hey, doc?

286
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,540
我有件事要告诉我爸
There's something I need to tell my dad.

287
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:29,310
我们没给他换房间  他还在326房间
We haven't moved him. He's still in room, uh, 326.

288
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:33,680
你有什么医学问题要问我吗
Do you have a medical question for me?

289
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,620
他快死了吗
Is he dying?

290
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,890
我们还不清楚
We don't know yet.

291
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,960
活检结果出来以后我们会更清楚
The biopsy will tell us more.

292
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:40,770
好吧
Okay.

293
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,120
我爸爸人很好
My dad is a good guy.

294
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,210
但我们从来都聊不来
We've just never been on the same page, you know?

295
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:56,330
我和我妈聊得更多
My mother was the one that I could talk to --

296
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,480
他也是
same for him.

297
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,840
所以  她不在
So, without her,

298
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,990
我们俩就像废人一样
we're both pretty useless.

299
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,960
326房间
Room 326.

300
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,300
好的
Right.

301
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:25,520
莫菲医生叫我过来跟你们说说不同的意见
Dr. Murphy called me in for a second opinion.

302
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,740
你的胳膊需要钢钉固定
you need some pins in your arm.

303
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,300
为什么  有什么变化吗
Why? What's changed?

304
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,590
我们看了你的放射报告
Well, after studying the radiology report,

305
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:36,180
考虑到你骨折的严重程度
given how bad the break is,

306
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,200
我们认为对骨折进行彻底有效的修复
we just think it would be a prudent step

307
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,160
才是比较慎重周全的治疗方法
to ensure an efficient and thorough mending to the break.

308
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:43,440
我还能再打棒球吗
Will I be able to play baseball again?

309
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,970
我觉得完全可以
Well, I don't see why not,

310
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:47,850
只要经过理疗  等骨折痊愈就可以
once it's completely healed, after some physiotherapy.

311
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:49,850
等多长时间我才能投球
How long before I can pitch?

312
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,020
这不好说
It's hard to say.

313
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,410
他想找个人替他撒谎
He wanted someone to lie for him.

314
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,550
他选了你
And he picked you.

315
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,960
梅里尔的儿子想征求些个人建议
Merrill's son asked for personal advice.

316
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,980
他选了你
And he picked you.

317
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,170
就是说啊
I know, right?

318
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,640
他有事瞒着他爸
He's lying to his dad about something.

319
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,440
是吗  什么事
Yeah? What?

320
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,650
我不知道
I don't know.

321
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,360
你没问吗
You didn't ask?

322
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,890
和病情无关
It didn't seem relevant, medically.

323
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:23,010
做个人类也没那么难
You know it's not that difficult to be a human being.

324
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:25,310
就跟他说「讲明真相」
Just tell him to "come clean,"

325
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,420
「诚为上策」
"Honesty is the best policy,"

326
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,010
「谎言是压在你心上的重担」
"A lie is a stone in your heart."

327
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:31,660
最后一句是谁说的
Who said the last one?

328
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:32,590
我说的
Me.

329
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,320
是我编的
I made it up.

330
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:40,290
我找到了
And...I got it.

331
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:43,860
他过敏了
He's anaphylactic.

332
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,810
-给我肾上腺素  -我正在退出来
- Would you get me an epi? - I'm coming out.

333
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:46,890
喉痉挛了  把管拔出来
The throat's constricting. Pull the tube.

334
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:03,230
「布朗医生」怎么样了
So, what's up with "Dr. Browne"?

335
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,760
她就是莉亚  对吗
She's Lea, isn't she?

336
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:08,590
克莱尔是我的同事
Claire is my colleague.

337
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,890
得了吧  我注意到你看她的眼神了
Oh, come on, I saw the way you were looking at her.

338
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:13,890
什么眼神
How?

339
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:18,030
我可没这样
I don't think I look like that.

340
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,510
好吧  那你为什么叫她来「会诊」
Okay, so then why'd you call her in for a "consult"?

341
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:24,670
好吧
Okay.

342
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:28,640
她比我更擅长与人交流
Yes, she's better at talking to people than I am.

343
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,430
这句话里我听出来了50个谎言
I counted like 50 tells there.

344
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,390
-你真的不擅长说谎  -我知道
- You really suck at lying. - I know.

345
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:37,780
太糟了  这可是重要的社交技巧
Too bad. It's an important social skill.

346
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,860
你怎么知道什么时候该撒谎
So how do you know when to lie?

347
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,440
如果人们需要知道什么
When people need to know things,

348
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,310
他们就需要知道
they need to know.

349
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:46,480
如果他们不需要
If they don't,

350
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:48,580
那就别有心理负担地撒个谎
lie through your teeth and feel good about it.

351
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,160
如果他们需要知道真相
What if they need to know the truth,

352
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,450
但真相会伤到他们呢
but it'll hurt them?

353
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:58,120
有些人可以承受  有些人不行
Some can handle it, some can't.

354
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,470
你怎么知道谁行谁不行
So how do you know who can and who can't?

355
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:01,770
那你就说实话
You tell the truth.

356
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,050
如果说了后他们还喜欢你  你就知道了
If they like you after, then you'll know.

357
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,550
如果他们不喜欢我了呢
If they don't?

358
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:08,310
那就也无所谓了
Then it doesn't really matter anyway.

359
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,280
你得了癌症
You have cancer.

360
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:22,110
我知道
Yeah, I know.

361
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:33,520
之前我腿痛  我父母带我去了医院
My parents took me in for a sore leg.

362
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,800
做了很多检查
After a whole bunch of tests,

363
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,140
医生找了他们谈话
they talked to the doctor,

364
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,200
他们出来后告诉我没事
then came out and told me I was fine.

365
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:40,190
就这样  「没事」
That's it. Just "fine."

366
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:44,180
隔天他们就给我买了PS4游戏机
The next day, they bought me a PS4.

367
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,310
所以我去谷歌上搜索了我的症状
So I Googled my symptoms,

368
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:50,900
把范围缩小到骨肉瘤或者发育痛
and I narrowed it down to osteosarcoma or growing pains.

369
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:54,390
但父母不可能因为发育痛就给你买游戏机
Kids don't get gaming systems for growing pains.

370
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,300
没关系的
It's okay.

371
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,760
我不怕死
I'm not afraid to die.

372
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:04,750
你不怕吗
You're not?

373
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:09,170
如果死的过程痛苦  那确实挺糟  但...
Well, I mean, the dying part will suck if it hurts, but...

374
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,130
我是不怕死亡本身的
I'm not afraid about the actual death part.

375
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:15,440
因为你相信自己死后会上天堂吗
Because you believe you're going to Heaven?

376
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,130
因为我不相信
Because I don't.

377
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:21,740
如果我相信有天堂
If I believe in Heaven,

378
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,190
我就得相信上帝的存在
then I got to believe in God,

379
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:25,490
我就得相信是上帝让我生病的
then I got to believe God made me sick.

380
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,340
那也太复杂了
How messed up is that?

381
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:31,690
相信这一切都是随机发生的就简单多了
It's just easier to think that it's all random.

382
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:35,340
当死亡来临的时候  一切就...
And when it's over, it's just...

383
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,340
结束了
over.

384
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,770
莉亚是怎么回事
So what about Lea?

385
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,890
你们在哪认识的
Where'd you guys meet?

386
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:49,730
在过道里
In the hallway.

387
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,580
真是个美丽的故事
That's a beautiful story.

388
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:58,090
是的  她是我的邻居
Yes. She's my neighbor.

389
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,930
真方便
Convenient.

390
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:02,900
他又有过敏反应了
He had another allergic reaction.

391
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,610
-那位胰腺患者  -对  梅里尔·威尔克斯
- The pancreas? - Merrill Wilks, yeah.

392
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:07,760
这次发作比第一次还要严重
And the second attack was even more severe than the first.

393
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,950
发生在我们做胰腺病变组织活体切片检查的时候
It coincided with biopsying the pancreatic lesion,

394
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,550
现在看  似乎是个囊肿
which now appears was a cyst.

395
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,560
我们现在知道他是对囊肿里面的物质过敏
Well, now we know he's allergic to whatever's in that cyst.

396
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,180
我们还知道再有一次囊肿破裂他可能会死
We also know that the next cyst that pops will probably kill him.

397
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:17,550
如果他还能等到下一次
Well, if there is a next.

398
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:18,820
去做几项检查
Let's run a couple tests,

399
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,190
看他体内是否有寄生虫
see if there's any evidence of parasites.

400
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:21,320
给他做全身核磁共振检查
And MRI his entire body --

401
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,190
如果我们够幸运
if we're lucky,

402
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:23,840
他只有这两个囊肿的话  就能出院了
he only had the two cysts and he can go home.

403
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,490
你在找漏洞吗
Are you looking for loopholes?

404
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,120
想要救埃文
Hoping to save Evan?

405
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:32,890
所有人都会犯错
Everyone makes mistakes.

406
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,120
那你得把医院所有的文件都再检查一遍
Which means you should double-check every file in the hospital.

407
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:38,930
他的嗜中性粒细胞计数为634
The oncologist flagged his

408
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:41,130
被肿瘤科医师标为偏低
neutrophil count of 634 as low.

409
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:42,290
那确实挺低的
That is low.

410
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:43,340
是正常范围内的低
Low normal.

411
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,620
这句话里不还是有个「低」字吗
I can still hear the word "Low" In there.

412
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:51,880
他只是个孩子
He's just a kid.

413
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,750
我理解想到他死掉有多难受
I know how hard it is to think of him dying.

414
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,850
他自己能接受
He's okay with that.

415
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,570
真令人难以置信
I find that hard to believe.

416
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:00,800
我们都会死
We all die --

417
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:02,950
如果大家能接受这一点  会更开心
if we accepted that, we'd be happier.

418
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:06,610
也许吧  但是人都是不知足的
Maybe. But we're not good with contentment.

419
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,980
与死亡斗争是我们生存的意义
Fighting death is what keeps us alive.

420
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,830
我发现了  是棘球绦虫
We got a hit -- Echinococcus.

421
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:22,930
「棘球绦虫」
Echinococcus?

422
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,480
囊肿里全都是绦虫吗
The cysts are filled with tapeworms?

423
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,150
还有其他囊肿吗
Cysts? There are more?

424
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:27,060
还有三个
Three more?

425
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,980
还有四个  他大脑里还有
Four more. You missed the one in his brain.

426
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:35,040
-格拉斯曼医生  -什么事
- Dr. Glassman? - Yeah?

427
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,960
你曾是一名神经外科医生  对吧
You used to be a neurosurgeon, right?

428
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,070
没错
So they say.

429
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,600
帮我拿一下
Take this, will you?

430
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,040
我需要一位  你有人可以推荐吗
I need one. Who would you recommend?

431
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,100
什么情况
What you got?

432
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:52,820
真厉害
That's cool.

433
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:58,130
我的脑子里怎么会有绦虫
How the hell did I get tapeworms in my head?

434
00:20:58,130 --> 00:20:59,980
不知道  但确实有
No idea, but you do.

435
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:02,600
你可能是通过土狼或者狼接触到的虫卵
You can pick up the eggs from coyotes or wolves.

436
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,550
你接触过狼或者土狼吗
You been hanging around coyotes or wolves?

437
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,910
我住在郊区
I live in the suburbs --

438
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:07,240
连儿童动物园都没有
we don't even have a petting zoo.

439
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,560
你的囊肿已经存在一段时间了
You might've had these cysts for quite some time.

440
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,110
其中一个破裂
When one of them burst,

441
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:13,320
导致了你的第一次过敏反应
that's what caused the first allergic reaction.

442
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,820
为什么会破裂
Well, why did it burst?

443
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,390
为什么会破裂
Why did it burst?

444
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:19,800
任何突然的动作  扭曲  转动或压迫
Any sudden movements, twists, turns, squeeze.

445
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,190
拥抱呢
A hug?

446
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:21,890
有可能
Could be.

447
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:26,160
但第二次发作时你不在场
But you weren't there for the second one.

448
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,840
我做活体组织切片检查时刺破了你的囊肿
I punctured the cyst on your pancreas during the biopsy.

449
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:36,000
你也看到了  过敏反应会逐次严重
As you've seen, allergic reactions get worse each time they happen.

450
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,650
要是再发生  就糟了
So a third one, that would be bad.

451
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:38,570
那会...
That would be...

452
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,240
会非常糟糕
That would be very bad.

453
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,950
因此我们计划通过手术来完整除去所有囊肿
So we're gonna have to surgically remove all the cysts intact.

454
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:46,620
格拉斯曼医生是全国声誉最高的
Dr. Glassman's one of the most highly acclaimed

455
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,690
神经外科医生之一
neurosurgeons in the state.

456
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:49,020
他做手术你可以放心了
You are very lucky to have him.

457
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:52,550
卡卢医生拍马屁也越来越厉害了
And Dr. Kalu is fast becoming a very accomplished flatterer.

458
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:56,010
颅内的囊肿很重要
The cranial cyst, that is a big deal.

459
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,410
我们得打开颅骨顶部
We're gonna have to take off the top of your skull.

460
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:00,550
你们要进到我脑袋里面去
You'd be digging in to my brain?

461
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,200
差不多是这样
Well, yeah, pretty much.

462
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,190
用生理盐水
With saline.

463
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:05,080
轻轻地用它移置囊肿
We use it to gently displace the cyst,

464
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,110
然后  它就奇迹般地出来了
and then, poof, it magically pops out.

465
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:08,520
有点像生孩子的过程
Kind of like delivering a baby.

466
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,680
如果分娩没有痛感的话
You know, if childbirth were painless.

467
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:13,390
之后再继续处理其他囊肿
And then we move on to the other cysts.

468
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:16,350
我们会治好你的
Hey, we're gonna take good care of you.

469
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,650
37度  轻度皮疹

470
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:05,000
轻度皮疹

471
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:23,960
埃文没得癌症
Evan doesn't have cancer.

472
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:37,860
BGM: Run The Jewels by Run The Jewels

473
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:40,200
可能不是癌症
It might not be cancer!

474
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:43,300
可能不是癌症
It might not be cancer!

475
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:47,700
看看你连续两次准时到了
Look at you on time -- two for two.

476
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,320
可能不是癌症
It might not be cancer.

477
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,780
-胳膊骨折患者  -是的
- Fractured arm? - Yes.

478
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:53,950
你说他被确诊为患有晚期骨肉瘤
You said he'd been diagnosed with stage four osteosarcoma.

479
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:56,710
埃文八个月前被确诊的
Evan was diagnosed with the flu eight months ago,

480
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:59,460
但他更符合感染埃-巴二氏病毒的症状
but his symptoms were actually a better fit with Epstein-Barr virus,

481
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,620
与朗格汉斯细胞组织细胞增生症有关
which is linked to Langerhans cell histiocytosis,

482
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:04,600
这会导致上肢长骨部位产生溶骨性病变
which causes osteolytic lesions in the long bones of the upper limbs.

483
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,480
而病变可能被误诊为骨肉瘤的症状
And those lesions could be misdiagnosed as signs of osteosarcoma.

484
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,840
-的确  -那他的脑肿瘤呢
- Yes. - What about his brain tumor?

485
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,290
朗格汉斯细胞也会在颅骨中出现
Langerhans can also manifest in the skull.

486
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,140
也就是说不是死亡诊断
Instead of a death sentence,

487
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:16,340
他的病可以用泼尼松轻松治愈是吗
he could have something that could easily be treated with prednisone?

488
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:19,590
接下来需要做骨髓穿刺进行确认
Next, we need to do a bone-marrow aspiration to confirm.

489
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,140
你应该看过他的病历了
I assume you've looked at his file.

490
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:22,300
看了很久
For a very long time.

491
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,540
上面肯定有活体组织检查
Well, there must've been a biopsy.

492
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:24,870
病理报告上怎么说
What did the pathology report say?

493
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:26,140
没错  做过两次活体组织检查
Yes. There were two biopsies.

494
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:28,430
两次都显示有骨肉瘤
Both were positive for osteosarcoma.

495
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:32,800
-莫菲  -他们可能误诊了
- Murphy... - They could be false positives.

496
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,510
你知道两次都误诊的可能性有多低吗
Do you have any idea how unlikely it is to have two false positives?

497
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:36,320
百分之零点三
0.3%.

498
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:38,280
因此我们倾向于认为这「不可能」
Which we can comfortably round off to "not likely."

499
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,520
但也有可能...
It is possible --

500
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:41,730
没错  但这意味着让濒死孩童的父母
Yes, but it means telling the parents of a dying child

501
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,860
去盼望一件根本没有可能的事
that there's hope, when really there isn't.

502
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:46,890
洗个澡准备巡房吧
Grab a shower and get ready for rounds.

503
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:56,940
-想象力与创造力  -没错
- Imaginative and creative. - Yes.

504
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,310
你正确的几率有多少
What are the chances you're right?

505
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:59,300
百分之零点三
0.3%.

506
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,600
330之1
330 to 1.

507
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,470
是333之1
333 to 1.

508
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:06,680
你真的认为值得让埃文父母经受这一切吗
You really think that it's worth putting Evan's parents through all this?

509
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,720
当然
Of course.

510
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,050
如果我们做了333次诊断
If we did this 333 times,

511
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,470
就意味着我们用大约四小时
we'd be giving false hope to 332 people

512
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:13,960
给了332个人虚假的希望
for approximately four hours,

513
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,190
但我们能拯救一个生命
and we'd save one life.

514
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:16,470
难道不值得吗
Isn't that worth it?

515
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:20,850
但梅伦德斯医生不允许我申请检测许可
Anyway, Dr. Melendez won't let me ask for consent to test.

516
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:22,880
如果我不告诉他们我在做什么呢
What if I don't tell them what I'm doing?

517
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:25,920
公然违反医德  这就是你的办法吗
A blatant ethics violation -- that's your solution?

518
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,740
没错
Yes.

519
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:28,390
我该怎么做
How do I do that?

520
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,580
就直接检测别告诉别人  谁也别说
You do it and then don't tell anyone. No one.

521
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,670
如果有人问起
If anyone asks...

522
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:43,380
就说主治医生注意到红血球数低  要找原因
your attending noticed a low RBC count and needed to find the cause...

523
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,510
就这样  没什么大不了的
that's it -- no biggie.

524
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:00,620
你知道圣克拉17街的威尔克斯杂货铺吗
You know Wilks' Grocery on Santa Clara 17th?

525
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,980
它已经建立近60年了
It's been an institution for nearly 60 years.

526
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:07,070
我祖父母于1958年开了这家店
My grandparents started it in 1958,

527
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,770
我和妻子在1982年接手
and my wife and I took it over in '82.

528
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:11,420
我妻子生病后
But when my wife got sick

529
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,500
我开始跟凯文说接手的事
and I started talking to Kevin about taking it over,

530
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,140
而他就那么离开了
he just... took off.

531
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:21,310
对他来说  那就是个卖生菜和厕纸的地方
To him, it was just a place to sell lettuce and toilet paper.

532
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:27,550
我父亲在英国开了一家房地产开发公司
My father chairs a real-estate development company in the U.K.

533
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:32,250
认为我是设立美国分公司的最佳人选
Thought I'd be the perfect person to set up the U.S. office.

534
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:34,720
但你想加入「救人行业」  是吗
You wanted to be in the "helping profession" ?

535
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,460
我想做我的专业
I wanted to be in my profession.

536
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:39,720
不在于企业的大小
It's not about how small or how big the venture is,

537
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:41,920
而在于做属于自己的事
it's about doing something that's yours.

538
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:45,980
我猜是吧
I guess.

539
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:55,690
他小时候  我们很亲密
When he was little, we were inseparable.

540
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:02,750
他很爱来店里「工作」
he used to love to come to the store to "work."

541
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:07,720
我给他做了个小围裙
I even had a little apron made for him --

542
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,180
上面还绣着他的名字
had his name on it, too.

543
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,930
不过你知道  孩子嘛
Still, you know, kids...

544
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:14,380
总会长大
grow up.

545
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,300
他还跟母亲很亲密我就很感激了
I'm just grateful that he stayed close to his mother.

546
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:22,100
他跟她无话不谈
He could talk to her, tell her anything.

547
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:25,440
我也是
So could I.

548
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:29,060
但她去世以后
And when she went...

549
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,920
我失去了他们两个
I lost them both.

550
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,070
他现在回来了
Looks like he's back now.

551
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:42,770
我只知道在我需要他的时候他丢下了我
All I know is he ditched me when I needed him.

552
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,860
正如智者所说
Well, you know, as a wise person once said,

553
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,380
「心怀怨恨是压在心里的重担」
"Holding a grudge is a stone in your heart."

554
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:00,110
这是做什么的
What's that for?

555
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:03,220
骨髓穿刺的局部麻醉
Local anaesthetic for a bone-marrow aspiration.

556
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,970
为什么要做骨髓穿刺
Why do I need a bone-marrow aspiration?

557
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,260
主治医生注意到你红血球数低
My attending saw a low RBC count

558
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,660
需要找到原因
and wants to find the cause --

559
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:12,880
没什么大不了的
no biggie.

560
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,680
「没什么大不了的」
"No biggie"?

561
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:15,850
你说谎
You're lying.

562
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:17,360
怎么回事
What's going on?

563
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,720
你已经告诉我是癌症晚期
You already told me I have terminal cancer,

564
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,090
还能更糟吗
what's worse than that?

565
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,500
你可能没得癌症
You might not.

566
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:32,560
可能不是骨肉瘤
It might not be osteosarcoma --

567
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:35,390
可能是朗格汉斯细胞组织细胞增生症
might be Langerhans cell histiocytosis,

568
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:36,510
是可治愈的
which is treatable.

569
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:38,110
可治愈
Treatable?

570
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:40,370
就是说  我可能不会死
As in, I might not die?

571
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:43,310
所以我需要做穿刺来验证
That's why I need to aspirate to find out for sure.

572
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:44,710
我父母知道吗
Do my parents know?

573
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:47,380
他们告诉我不要点燃你父母的希望
I was told not to get their hopes up.

574
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:51,890
那我们趁他们没回来  快做吧
Then let's do it before they get back.

575
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,610
请侧过身去
Roll onto your side.

576
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,530
有没有做穿刺的童军徽章啊
Is there a Scout badge for aspirations?

577
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,400
我觉得刚刚有人说了个笑话
I think someone just made a joke.

578
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:14,930
你们好
Hello.

579
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:15,800
你们在做什么
What are you doing?

580
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:16,690
止疼药
Painkiller.

581
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:18,320
我胳膊疼
My arm hurts.

582
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,490
这并不能解释我为什么要在你的腰部注射
That wouldn't explain why I'd be injecting your lumbar region.

583
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,820
好吧  你们好
Okay. Yes, hello.

584
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:31,960
我觉得埃文的癌症可能是误诊
I think Evan may have been misdiagnosed with cancer.

585
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:36,320
我认为他患有其他会造成骨骼
I think he has something that creates bone lesions

586
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:37,800
看起来像骨肉瘤的病变
that look like osteosarcoma.

587
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,770
可能性很小  只有0.3%  但是我...
It's a small chance, 0.3%, but I --

588
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:42,700
你告诉埃文他得了癌症
You -- You told Evan that he has cancer?

589
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:45,760
现在你又告诉他  告诉我们他没得
And now you are telling him -- and us that he doesn't?

590
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,360
我是告诉你们他也许没有
I'm telling you he might not.

591
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,460
所以我需要做个穿刺
That's why I need to perform this aspiration.

592
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,630
他说我可能还有救
He says whatever I have might be treatable.

593
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:52,220
你疯了吗
Are you insane?

594
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:53,480
不  我没疯
No. I am not insane.

595
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,530
我以为你们会高兴的
I thought you'd be happy.

596
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:55,860
两者有显著联系
There is a significant link between

597
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,650
朗格汉斯细胞组织细胞增生症和...
Langerhans cell histiocytosis and --

598
00:29:57,650 --> 00:29:59,020
出去
Go! Get out!

599
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,120
我给你倒点儿水
Let me get you some water.

600
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,610
-天啊  -手在这儿
- Oh, my God! - Hands right here --

601
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:11,400
接着呢
Right here!

602
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,420
呼吸机  立刻
Respiratory, stat!

603
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:21,450
他体内有栓塞
He has a massive embolus,

604
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:23,580
可能是从骨折处出来的
probably thrown from his fracture.

605
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:26,530
位于肺动脉分叉处
It's located at the bifurcation of the pulmonary arteries.

606
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:28,320
他快要血流动力塌陷了
He's close to hemodynamic collapse.

607
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,420
这可不是闹着玩的
Yeah, no kidding.

608
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:30,850
我可以协助
I'd like to assist.

609
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,270
不可能
Not a chance.

610
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:34,630
好吧  我想协助
Okay. I'd like to assist.

611
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,880
很明显  你对这个病例过于上心了
You're obviously too close to the case.

612
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:39,060
我认为我这样正好
I think I'm just the right amount of close.

613
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:40,550
莫菲  你向他父母说谎
Murphy, you lied to the parents

614
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:42,490
以便能试着证明你的荒谬理论
just so you could try to prove your ridiculous theory.

615
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:43,610
你太过于上心了
You're too damn close.

616
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:47,750
骑跨性栓塞  刷手准备手术
Saddle embolism, scrub in.

617
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:57,240
我们得在他心脏骤停之前去除栓塞
We have to get rid of the embolus before he arrests.

618
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,080
他的心脏几乎不泵血了
His heart is barely pumping blood.

619
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:00,270
我可以感觉到肺动脉
I can feel the pulmonary artery...

620
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:02,800
我只需要找到栓塞  在这里
I just need to find the obstruction...there!

621
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,610
找到了
I got it.

622
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:04,360
手术刀
Knife.

623
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,630
-手术刀  -心电图显示右心损伤
- Knife. - EKG is showing right heart strain.

624
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:07,780
他坚持不了这么久了
He can't take this much longer.

625
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,370
我知道  但是如果我再快一点儿
I know, but if I move any quicker,

626
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:11,770
可能会伤到左主动脉  他就死了
I could nick the left main artery and kill the boy.

627
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:19,370
那句「没什么大不了的」让我暴露了
The phrase "No biggie" gave me away.

628
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:21,580
你真得学学怎么撒谎  肖恩
You really got to learn how to lie, Shaun.

629
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,700
我有麻烦了吗
Am I in trouble?

630
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:25,950
是的
Yes.

631
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:28,910
除非你是对的
Unless you're right.

632
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,710
如果我错了  他们不应该难过
If I'm wrong, they shouldn't be upset.

633
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:33,940
他们知道  这几乎不可能
They know it's highly unlikely.

634
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:39,710
虚假的希望  肖恩  这就是残酷
False hope, Shaun... it's just plain cruel.

635
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,730
他跟你聊过了
He talk to you?

636
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,920
你跟他聊了吗
Did you talk to him?

637
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,950
我不知道和他说什么
I don't know what to tell him.

638
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:12,070
你爱你父亲  不是吗
You love your father, don't you?

639
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:13,590
当然
Yeah, of course.

640
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:15,800
他要做脑部手术了
Right. Well, he's about to go in for brain surgery.

641
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:17,600
风险很大
There's huge risks involved.

642
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:19,250
不管这个谎言是什么
Whatever this lie is,

643
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:21,600
你打算余生都背负这个谎言吗
can you live the rest of your life knowing you kept it from him?

644
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,420
我女朋友没病
My -- My girlfriend wasn't sick.

645
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,440
她甩了我
Okay? She dumped me.

646
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:41,670
她结婚了  还有两个孩子
She's married with two kids --

647
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:43,490
不打算离开他们
had no intention of leaving them.

648
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:45,390
我是个傻子
I-I was an idiot.

649
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:47,620
你心都碎了  这是问题所在吗
You got your heart broken, that's the problem here?

650
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:48,910
不  不是  爸
No -- no, Dad.

651
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:50,720
问题在于
The problem is...

652
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:53,170
我跑去泰国
I didn't run away to Thailand

653
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:56,310
不是因为我瞧不上威尔克斯杂货铺
because I thought Wilks' Grocery was beneath me.

654
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:02,100
而是我害怕我永远没法接替你
I was afraid that I would never be able to fill your shoes...

655
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,560
事实证明确实如此
And then I proved myself right.

656
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:24,810
左肺动脉打开
Left pulmonary artery's open.

657
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:26,060
弹簧钳
Ring Forceps.

658
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,440
弹簧钳
Ring Forceps.

659
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,440
拜托
Come on.

660
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:37,400
取出来了
Got it.

661
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,600
心电趋于正常
EKG is normalizing.

662
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:43,820
他没事了
He's okay.

663
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:44,880
干得好
Nice job.

664
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,220
好的  冲洗左肺动脉  进行缝合
All right, flush the left pulmonary artery and close him up.

665
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:49,100
好的
Okay.

666
00:33:57,130 --> 00:33:58,170
梅伦德斯医生
Dr. Melendez...

667
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:00,220
你来看一下
Take a look at this.

668
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:15,480
候诊室

669
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,310

00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:29,670
珍惜你们共度的时光
眷恋拥抱彼此的温暖
结婚周年快乐

673
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:29,670
来自  德克和安吉

00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,110
很感谢
I appreciate that.

677
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:44,370
《杀死一只知更鸟》

678
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:47,330
谢谢  肖恩
Thanks, Shaun.

679
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:00,500
我们移除了栓塞
We got the embolism.

680
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,070
他还在恢复  情况不错
He's in recovery and he's doing fine.

681
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,620
但我们在里面时有所发现
But while we were in there, we did find something else.

682
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:10,640
他肋骨有损伤
Lesions on his ribs.

683
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:16,330
骨肉瘤的确凿证据

684
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:19,630
转移到胸腔了
It's metastasized to his chest cavity.

685
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:23,090
我很遗憾
I'm sorry.

686
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:33,690
抱歉
I'm very sorry.

687
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:40,680
圣何塞圣文德医院

688
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:58,690
给它洗个暖乎乎的盐水澡
Give that a nice, warm saline bath.

689
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,990
请给我钳子和泰勒剪
Forceps and Taylor scissors, please.

690
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,100
钳子和泰勒剪

691
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:03,830
谢谢
Thank you.

692
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,420
看那个
Look at that.

693
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:16,750
就是它建造了埃及金字塔
That's what built the pyramids,

694
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,610
画出蒙娜·丽莎
painted the Mona Lisa,

695
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:21,500
发明网络
invented the Internet.

696
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:26,120
那是我们的闯入者
There is our interloper.

697
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:28,280
请给我挤压球  黛德丽

699
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,540
他取的  不是我们
His name for it, not ours.

700
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:35,890
盐水轻轻地将囊肿
The saline gently displaces the cyst

701
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:38,690
从它的躲藏处冲出来
and coaxes it out of its little hiding place --

702
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:42,490
希望完整无损  我们就不用紧张了
Hopefully in one piece so we don't have to call 911.

703
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:44,920
加油  现在...
Come on, now...

704
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,190
请给我托盘
Tray, please.

705
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,200
出来了...
There we go...

706
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:50,780
还差一点点
A little bit more...

707
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,920
现在出来了
And there we go.

708
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:55,390
搞定
Got it.

709
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:58,290
他的眼睛很像他父亲
He has his father's eyes.

710
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:00,450
难以置信
That was incredible.

711
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:01,950
搞定一个  还有三个
One down, three to go...

712
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,110
他醒了
There he is.

713
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,230
亲爱的
Hi, Sweetie.

714
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:21,170
怎么了
What's the matter?

715
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,480
没什么
Nothing.

716
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:26,030
我们只是很高兴  你做得很好
We're just happy you did so great.

717
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:29,740
你患有栓塞
You had what's called an embolism.

718
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:32,670
导致肺部动脉被堵
It clogged an artery in your lungs.

719
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:34,710
好消息是他们已经取出来了
But the good news is they got it.

720
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:37,070
你会没事的
And you're gonna be just fine.

721
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,310
但...
Still...

722
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:41,490
患了癌症还是很糟糕吧
too bad about the cancer, huh?

723
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:42,600
不  不  不
No, no, no, no.

724
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,730
那医生不知道自己在说什么
The doctor did not know what he was talking about --

725
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:46,640
爸爸  我全知道
Dad, I know all about it.

726
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:49,130
已经知道很久了
I have for a long time.

727
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:52,800
我...
I --

728
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:58,190
我非常遗憾
I am so sorry.

729
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,490
没事的
It's okay.

730
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:16,300
因为我不会孤单
Because I'm not gonna be alone.

731
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,900
奶奶也会在那里
Grandma's gonna be there, too.

732
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:22,620
艾琳阿姨
Auntie Arlene.

733
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:28,620
吉姆叔叔  如果他学会好好说话了
Uncle Jim, if he figured out how to stop swearing.

734
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:36,290
我给你倒杯水  伙计
I'll get you some water, buddy.

735
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:51,000
我在附近遛了遛潘妮
So, I took Penny for a walk -- just around the block.

736
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:56,360
给了它点生皮零食
And I picked her up some of those rawhide treats,

737
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,110
你知道
you know...

738
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,470
以前妈妈常给它的那些
the ones that Mom used to like to give to her.

739
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:09,370
我想她了  爸
I miss her, Dad.

740
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:40,250
解除警报了
Coast is clear?

741
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:47,640
是
Yes.

742
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,650
谢谢
Thank you.

743
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,400
我错了
I was wrong.

744
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:52,580
你尽力了
You tried.

745
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:54,050
我错了
I was wrong.

746
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:57,450
你的父母恨我
Your parents hate me.

747
00:39:57,450 --> 00:39:58,200
我知道
I know.

748
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:00,520
-我给了你虚假希望  -是
- I gave you false hope. - Yeah.

749
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:03,410
但在那一刻  还是挺棒的
But for a minute there, it was pretty awesome.

750
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,410
我想请你帮个忙
I'm going to ask you for a favor.

751
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:13,750
我不会让出许愿基金会名额的
Well, I'm not giving away my Make-A-Wish.

752
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:16,250
你介意我读点什么给你吗
Would you mind if I read you something?

753
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:17,450
不会很久
It's not long.

754
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,690
我不介意
That I can do.

755
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:22,360
《杀死一只知更鸟》

756
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,170
阿提库斯是对的
Atticus was right.

757
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:34,920
有一次他说你无法理解别人
One time he said you never really know a man

758
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:38,160
除非你穿上他的鞋走一圈
until you stand in his shoes and walk around in them.

759
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,190
站在拉德利门廊就够了
Just standing on the Radley porch was enough.

760
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:42,630
街灯很模糊
The streetlights were fuzzy

761
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:44,660
因为外头正下着细雨
from the fine rain that was falling

762
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:46,490
我回家的路上
As I made my way home,

763
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:48,040
我感到苍老...
I felt very old...

764
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:57,870
BGM: Forest by Rogue Wave

765
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:55,640
? I can't protect you from the course of life ?

766
00:40:57,330 --> 00:41:03,510
? But you know me and you know I was born to try ?

767
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:10,610
? It's just the symptom of a middle-aged attack ?

768
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:15,490
阿提克斯真的很好
Atticus, he was real nice.

769
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,940
他的双手在我下巴之下
His hands were under my chin,

770
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:18,350
帮我盖被
pulling up the cover,

771
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:19,810
陪我入睡
tucking it around me.

772
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:23,410
很多人都是  斯科特  你终会看见真面目
Most people are, Scout, when you finally see them.

773
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:27,150
他关掉灯  走去杰姆的房间
He turned out the light and went into Jem's room.

774
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:28,670
他会在那待一整晚
He would be there all night,

775
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:32,510
等杰姆早上醒来时他也会在那里
and he would be there when Jem waked up in the morning.

776
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:39,000
听起来是本不错的书
Sounds like a good book.

777
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:42,250
可以提前给个剧透啊
Could've used a spoiler alert, though.

778
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:49,770
谢谢
Thank you.

779
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:55,030
? Confusing you, from what you need ?

780
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:58,830
? Every hand that you hold ?

781
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,650
? It comes back ?

782
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:01,390
我读完了
That's all.

783
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:06,890
? Every word, every ride ?

784
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:12,490
? It comes back every time ?

785
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:21,190
? It comes back every time ?

786
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:26,520
? Every time ?
