1
00:00:00,906 --> 00:00:02,523
<i>Previously on "The Good Doctor"...</i>

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:04,078
How hard can it be

3
00:00:04,109 --> 00:00:06,381
to just act like a normal human being?!

4
00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:07,672
No!

5
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:09,433
Stop petting that stupid rabbit!

6
00:00:09,458 --> 00:00:11,333
We're never going home again.

7
00:00:11,411 --> 00:00:13,011
We have each other,
and that's all we need.

8
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:16,447
My brother went to heaven
in front of my eyes.

9
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:19,884
Never forget, you're the smart one.

10
00:00:19,886 --> 00:00:22,086
And I'm proud of you, Shaun.

11
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:28,827
Dad?

12
00:00:34,033 --> 00:00:35,688
Hey!

13
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:38,036
Yeah, I missed you, too!

14
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,899
Oh, Penny, come.

15
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:41,852
Stay.

16
00:00:42,085 --> 00:00:44,319
Hey, Dad.

17
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:46,477
Sorry it's so early. I just landed.

18
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:48,446
Actually, you're a bit late.

19
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:49,714
Five weeks.

20
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,788
I know. I know.

21
00:00:52,853 --> 00:00:56,679
- I'm sorry.
- I-I-It's a long story, okay?

22
00:00:56,923 --> 00:00:58,790
But h-how was it?

23
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:00,925
It was your mother's funeral.

24
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:05,597
Dad, I'm...

25
00:01:15,207 --> 00:01:16,441
Okay.

26
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:18,710
Well, um, you have my cell number.

27
00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:21,164
It only works if you answer it.

28
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:30,154
Dad?

29
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:31,756
Dad?!

30
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,358
Dad!

31
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,360
Hey, hey! Hey... you okay?

32
00:01:35,362 --> 00:01:37,061
You okay? You can't breathe?!

33
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:39,355
No? No. Okay. I'm gonna call for help.

34
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:42,600
Yeah, 911? My dad collapsed!

35
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,235
He can't... he can't breathe,
please hurry!

36
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:45,475
Just hold on, Dad!

37
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:54,545
Good morning, everyone!

38
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:56,381
Right on time. What, did you sleep here

39
00:01:56,383 --> 00:01:59,150
or use a teleportation device?

40
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:01,586
I used a teleportation device.

41
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:05,690
Nonsensical questions
usually imply sarcasm,

42
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:08,359
which I've found people
often answer sarcastically.

43
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:09,427
Good one.

44
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:12,230
Trauma wants a consult
on a 66-year-old male

45
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:14,499
who collapsed from severe anaphylaxis,

46
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:16,534
complicated by respiratory arrest.

47
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:18,069
His son just got back from Thailand.

48
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:20,204
Almost immediately, the father
had his allergic reaction.

49
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:24,008
Patient has a few allergies...

50
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,410
pollen, mold, shellfish...

51
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:27,478
but no corresponding allergens
were in evidence.

52
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,928
Why are we doing a
surgical consult on an allergy?

53
00:02:29,953 --> 00:02:31,426
Well, we're not. We're doing a consult

54
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:33,651
on the excruciating
abdominal pain he now has.

55
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:39,156
As you may have heard.

56
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:42,648
Mr. Wilks, hi, I'm Dr. Neil Melendez.

57
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,662
Heard you had some abdominal pain.

58
00:03:09,309 --> 00:03:14,823
<font color="#0080ff">Synced & corrected by</font> kinglouisxx

59
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,686
The guy was in some serious pain...

60
00:03:21,688 --> 00:03:23,086
10 milligrams of morphine worth.

61
00:03:23,111 --> 00:03:25,022
Test results show elevated lipase,

62
00:03:25,024 --> 00:03:26,924
amylase, pancreatic enzymes.

63
00:03:26,926 --> 00:03:28,159
Pancreas is enlarged.

64
00:03:28,161 --> 00:03:30,561
Could be pancreatitis,
maybe alcohol-induced.

65
00:03:30,563 --> 00:03:32,063
The son said he smelled alcohol
on his father

66
00:03:32,065 --> 00:03:33,231
at 6:00 in the morning.

67
00:03:33,233 --> 00:03:35,199
And anaphylaxis has been known
to precipitate

68
00:03:35,201 --> 00:03:37,001
attacks of pancreatitis.

69
00:03:37,003 --> 00:03:38,402
Guess that's it, then.

70
00:03:40,506 --> 00:03:42,473
Meaning you totally disagree.

71
00:03:42,475 --> 00:03:44,242
Not everyone who starts
their day off with a Mimosa

72
00:03:44,244 --> 00:03:46,249
fries their pancreas.

73
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,912
Your eyesight must a
hell of a lot better than mine.

74
00:03:47,914 --> 00:03:49,914
Because I can't see the entire pancreas

75
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:51,816
due to the overlying bowel gas.

76
00:03:54,253 --> 00:03:56,687
We'll order an abdominal CT
and take a better look.

77
00:03:56,689 --> 00:03:58,256
There you go.

78
00:03:58,258 --> 00:03:59,814
Where the hell is Murphy?

79
00:03:59,815 --> 00:04:01,302
It's a severe fracture,

80
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,004
but I don't think you'll need pins.

81
00:04:03,029 --> 00:04:04,896
Young bones tend to heal very well.

82
00:04:04,898 --> 00:04:08,699
Young Bones? Isn't that a "Star
TREK: Origins" graphic novel?

83
00:04:11,303 --> 00:04:13,905
I'm not sure.

84
00:04:13,907 --> 00:04:15,339
No, that was a joke.

85
00:04:15,341 --> 00:04:16,641
Where are your parents?

86
00:04:16,643 --> 00:04:18,509
They're coming.
They both work in the city,

87
00:04:18,511 --> 00:04:20,278
so it's a long drive for them.

88
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,146
I was on a school field trip,

89
00:04:22,148 --> 00:04:23,681
and I tripped over my own feet.

90
00:04:23,683 --> 00:04:26,451
Of course, it was
right in front of Shelby Lomar.

91
00:04:26,453 --> 00:04:27,852
At least it was pretty gross,

92
00:04:27,854 --> 00:04:30,088
so I got some sympathy points for that.

93
00:04:33,225 --> 00:04:34,792
I would expect this to have been caused

94
00:04:34,794 --> 00:04:36,561
by a more serious accident.

95
00:04:36,563 --> 00:04:37,695
Nope, just a trip.

96
00:04:37,697 --> 00:04:38,863
I do that a lot.

97
00:04:38,865 --> 00:04:41,365
What can I say? I'm clumsy.

98
00:04:41,367 --> 00:04:43,401
Yes. Now follow my finger.

99
00:04:49,876 --> 00:04:51,242
You have some nystagmus...

100
00:04:51,244 --> 00:04:53,377
an involuntary eye movement.

101
00:04:53,379 --> 00:04:55,480
So what's that mean?

102
00:04:55,482 --> 00:04:57,348
When you fell, did you hit your head?

103
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,483
No.

104
00:04:58,485 --> 00:04:59,984
What, you think I have brain damage?

105
00:04:59,986 --> 00:05:02,553
Nystagmus <i>can</i> be a sign
of a neurological issue.

106
00:05:02,555 --> 00:05:03,491
Oh.

107
00:05:03,516 --> 00:05:06,085
Well, that would explain the "C" I got
in social studies.

108
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,861
That was another joke, wasn't it?

109
00:05:09,863 --> 00:05:11,113
Mm.

110
00:05:11,998 --> 00:05:14,298
I'm going to order a head CT for you.

111
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,733
Go for it.

112
00:05:18,904 --> 00:05:20,538
Shaun, are you getting any sleep?

113
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,973
- Yes.
- Really?

114
00:05:21,975 --> 00:05:23,474
I mean, really getting sleep?

115
00:05:23,476 --> 00:05:24,809
I got here on time.

116
00:05:24,811 --> 00:05:25,843
Well, that's good.

117
00:05:25,845 --> 00:05:28,179
I used a teleportation device.

118
00:05:32,685 --> 00:05:34,919
Radiology form, please.

119
00:05:39,993 --> 00:05:41,742
Shaun, that boy, he looks like...

120
00:05:41,744 --> 00:05:42,804
Steve.

121
00:05:42,829 --> 00:05:44,228
He does.

122
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:45,796
Is he related?

123
00:05:45,798 --> 00:05:48,633
His name is Evan Gallico,
so I don't think so.

124
00:05:51,003 --> 00:05:52,637
Wow. That is uncanny.

125
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,071
Just coincidental.

126
00:05:54,073 --> 00:05:56,274
He looks exactly like your brother.

127
00:05:56,276 --> 00:05:57,308
No, he doesn't.

128
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:59,143
His hair is shorter.

129
00:05:59,145 --> 00:06:00,945
It freaks me out.
It doesn't freak you out?

130
00:06:00,947 --> 00:06:02,513
No.

131
00:06:02,515 --> 00:06:05,583
- It's okay if it does...
- No, he's not Steve. Steve's dead.

132
00:06:10,063 --> 00:06:12,557
"I used a teleportation device"
was a joke.

133
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:16,661
Yeah, that's... that's good.

134
00:06:25,304 --> 00:06:27,872
So, I couldn't come to Mom's funeral

135
00:06:27,874 --> 00:06:30,107
because I fell in love.

136
00:06:32,211 --> 00:06:33,911
She was another teacher at the school.

137
00:06:33,913 --> 00:06:35,845
A Thai woman.

138
00:06:36,082 --> 00:06:37,448
And she was kind and...

139
00:06:37,508 --> 00:06:40,711
and beautiful and loving...

140
00:06:41,854 --> 00:06:44,414
and very, very sick.

141
00:06:44,757 --> 00:06:47,291
She had a congenital heart defect.

142
00:06:52,831 --> 00:06:56,801
Look, if you don't want
to tell me where you've been

143
00:06:56,803 --> 00:06:58,369
for the last six months, then don't.

144
00:06:58,371 --> 00:06:59,403
It's your business.

145
00:06:59,405 --> 00:07:01,172
But don't insult my intelligence.

146
00:07:01,174 --> 00:07:02,607
Well, I couldn't just leave her.

147
00:07:02,609 --> 00:07:04,041
You couldn't leave her for five minutes

148
00:07:04,043 --> 00:07:05,076
to make a phone call?

149
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,813
This a bad time?

150
00:07:08,815 --> 00:07:12,216
No, come in.

151
00:07:16,521 --> 00:07:17,722
According to the CT,

152
00:07:17,724 --> 00:07:19,357
you have a lesion on your pancreas.

153
00:07:19,359 --> 00:07:20,925
Well, what do you think
this lesion could be?

154
00:07:20,927 --> 00:07:21,892
Not sure.

155
00:07:21,894 --> 00:07:23,728
That's why we need to biopsy it.

156
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:25,763
It could just be a benign cyst.

157
00:07:25,765 --> 00:07:26,748
Or...?

158
00:07:26,773 --> 00:07:28,087
Or...

159
00:07:29,135 --> 00:07:32,132
it could be cancer, right?

160
00:07:32,205 --> 00:07:33,838
We'll know soon enough.

161
00:07:50,915 --> 00:07:52,448
This won't take long.

162
00:07:52,592 --> 00:07:54,525
I know. I've had two of these.

163
00:07:54,527 --> 00:07:56,193
One more and I get my Scout badge.

164
00:08:00,565 --> 00:08:01,632
That was funny.

165
00:08:01,634 --> 00:08:03,401
Tough to tell without looking at you,

166
00:08:03,403 --> 00:08:05,770
but I'm guessing that was sarcasm.

167
00:08:05,772 --> 00:08:07,838
No. I have autism,

168
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,142
which makes it hard
for me to read social cues.

169
00:08:11,144 --> 00:08:12,343
Jokes are difficult.

170
00:08:12,345 --> 00:08:14,945
I used to know a kid with autism. Peter.

171
00:08:14,947 --> 00:08:18,849
He was kind of weird but super nice.

172
00:08:18,851 --> 00:08:20,384
Used to know?

173
00:08:20,386 --> 00:08:22,219
You don't know him anymore?

174
00:08:22,221 --> 00:08:23,721
He died.

175
00:08:23,723 --> 00:08:26,023
Hit by a car.

176
00:08:26,025 --> 00:08:28,592
You know anyone who died?

177
00:08:28,594 --> 00:08:30,261
My brother.

178
00:08:30,263 --> 00:08:31,429
That sucks.

179
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,101
Why did you have the other CT scans?

180
00:08:37,103 --> 00:08:39,437
My parents have...

181
00:08:39,439 --> 00:08:41,505
uh, what's the word
for fear of getting sick?

182
00:08:41,507 --> 00:08:43,240
Hypochondriasis?

183
00:08:43,242 --> 00:08:45,176
Mm, no, worse than that.

184
00:08:45,178 --> 00:08:47,878
They have... nosophobia.

185
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,747
I love that word.

186
00:08:49,749 --> 00:08:52,650
What do you think of Miss Gannett?

187
00:08:52,652 --> 00:08:53,851
She's nice.

188
00:08:53,853 --> 00:08:56,854
I think she's callipygian.

189
00:08:56,856 --> 00:08:58,356
She's what?

190
00:08:58,358 --> 00:08:59,590
Callipygian?

191
00:08:59,592 --> 00:09:02,426
It means "having
shapely buttocks," Shaun.

192
00:09:02,428 --> 00:09:03,561
Duh.

193
00:09:06,164 --> 00:09:07,832
You read the dictionary.

194
00:09:07,834 --> 00:09:10,835
What it lacks in plot,
it makes up for in vocab.

195
00:09:10,837 --> 00:09:13,537
So, you married?

196
00:09:13,539 --> 00:09:15,840
Girlfriend?

197
00:09:15,842 --> 00:09:17,508
Boyfriend?

198
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,909
Tropical fish?

199
00:09:21,113 --> 00:09:22,613
I like Lea.

200
00:09:22,615 --> 00:09:24,815
Ooh. And who's Lea?

201
00:09:24,817 --> 00:09:26,050
Lea is a friend.

202
00:09:26,052 --> 00:09:28,052
A friend you date?

203
00:09:28,054 --> 00:09:30,154
A friend with benefits?

204
00:09:30,156 --> 00:09:32,823
I lend her batteries sometimes.

205
00:09:32,825 --> 00:09:33,858
I like where this is going...

206
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:40,931
So, you know, keep going.

207
00:09:40,933 --> 00:09:43,234
'Cause if you don't, I will.

208
00:09:43,236 --> 00:09:44,869
It's kind of my thing, you know?

209
00:09:44,871 --> 00:09:47,071
Just constant talking...
annoys everyone.

210
00:09:47,113 --> 00:09:49,413
- Murphy.
- Well, I guess not everyone.

211
00:09:49,438 --> 00:09:50,367
Hey.

212
00:09:50,391 --> 00:09:51,999
My family's pretty used
to me now. I mean...

213
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,783
Hey.

214
00:09:52,785 --> 00:09:55,519
...my friends are
very talkative as well, so...

215
00:09:55,521 --> 00:09:57,221
You're giving
the fractured arm a head CT?

216
00:09:57,223 --> 00:09:58,625
- Yes.
- Get back to the pancreas.

217
00:09:58,650 --> 00:09:59,690
He's not clumsy.

218
00:09:59,692 --> 00:10:02,293
He has a brain tumor
behind the inner ear.

219
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:06,096
Forget the pancreas.

220
00:10:13,038 --> 00:10:15,105
Mr. and Mrs. Gallico?

221
00:10:15,107 --> 00:10:16,507
- Hi.
- Hi.

222
00:10:16,509 --> 00:10:17,808
I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.

223
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:18,976
I'm treating your son.

224
00:10:18,978 --> 00:10:20,044
Well, how is he?

225
00:10:20,046 --> 00:10:21,412
We were told it was a bad break,

226
00:10:21,414 --> 00:10:23,080
but it should heal no problem.

227
00:10:23,082 --> 00:10:24,682
I know why Evan tripped.

228
00:10:24,684 --> 00:10:27,485
He had a tumor in the temporal
bone behind his left ear,

229
00:10:27,487 --> 00:10:29,153
which is affecting his balance.

230
00:10:29,155 --> 00:10:31,822
I've arranged for a consult
with Dr. Najid in oncology

231
00:10:31,824 --> 00:10:33,324
- and she's going...
- No, that won't be necessary.

232
00:10:33,326 --> 00:10:34,800
We...

233
00:10:34,927 --> 00:10:36,994
We already have an oncologist.

234
00:10:38,831 --> 00:10:41,779
Evan's been diagnosed
with stage four osteosarcoma.

235
00:10:42,235 --> 00:10:44,235
He was complaining of a sore shin.

236
00:10:44,237 --> 00:10:48,105
The last thing that we expected
was bone cancer.

237
00:10:48,107 --> 00:10:49,306
The doctors at SFM,

238
00:10:49,308 --> 00:10:51,842
they gave him a year to live.

239
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,209
That was seven months ago.

240
00:10:57,627 --> 00:11:00,928
Osteosarcoma explains
the severity of his fracture...

241
00:11:00,953 --> 00:11:03,387
he will need pins in his arm after all.

242
00:11:03,389 --> 00:11:04,688
Uh, can we see him?

243
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:07,091
Yes. He's in room 414.

244
00:11:07,093 --> 00:11:08,859
Uh, Dr. Murphy?

245
00:11:11,263 --> 00:11:14,252
He doesn't know about his diagnosis.

246
00:11:14,668 --> 00:11:18,304
We would really like
to keep it that way.

247
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:28,686
He's the patient.

248
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,555
Doesn't he have the right
to know the truth?

249
00:11:30,557 --> 00:11:31,656
Well, no.

250
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:33,892
He's also a minor, so, no, he doesn't.

251
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:35,193
Evan's very intelligent...

252
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:36,327
he'd be able to handle it.

253
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:38,797
Well, Shaun, maybe
it's not just about Evan.

254
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:41,699
Maybe it's about his parents, as well.

255
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:45,570
Maybe it's just too difficult
for them to tell Evan right now.

256
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:46,638
I don't know.

257
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,972
Then they're the ones
who shouldn't be told.

258
00:11:47,974 --> 00:11:49,574
Well, let me ask you this, Shaun...

259
00:11:49,599 --> 00:11:52,587
what's so wrong about Evan being allowed

260
00:11:52,612 --> 00:11:55,313
to enjoy as much of his life
as possible?

261
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:57,048
Evan wants to know the truth.

262
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,249
How do you know that?

263
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:05,890
If this were Steve,
if this were your brother,

264
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:07,192
would he want to know the truth?

265
00:12:07,194 --> 00:12:08,560
Is that what this is?

266
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:16,034
Dad's such a tool.

267
00:12:16,036 --> 00:12:17,235
I found my birthday present...

268
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,003
in their closet,
right where they always hide it.

269
00:12:19,005 --> 00:12:20,138
I was just about to open it

270
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,240
when Dad caught me snooping
and freaked out.

271
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:25,410
I <i>hate</i> all that phony surprise stuff.

272
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:28,413
It's an AquaBlast Water Cannon.

273
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:30,715
I was with Mom when she bought it.

274
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:32,016
Thank you, Shaun.

275
00:12:32,018 --> 00:12:33,985
Your honesty's refreshing!

276
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:40,792
Yes, he would want to know the truth.

277
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:43,394
Well, there's nothing
we can do about it.

278
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:45,330
It's not your decision... it's theirs.

279
00:12:45,332 --> 00:12:46,798
He's their son.

280
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:03,481
Claire, I need you.

281
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:07,018
Sure, what's up?

282
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,805
I need someone to lie for me.

283
00:13:10,861 --> 00:13:12,903
Okay...

284
00:13:13,777 --> 00:13:15,510
I'm flattered?

285
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:21,340
Hey, doc?

286
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:24,669
There's something I need to tell my dad.

287
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:27,672
We haven't moved him.
He's still in room, uh, 326.

288
00:13:30,449 --> 00:13:32,772
Do you have a medical question for me?

289
00:13:33,914 --> 00:13:35,346
Is he dying?

290
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:36,681
We don't know yet.

291
00:13:36,683 --> 00:13:38,683
The biopsy will tell us more.

292
00:13:38,685 --> 00:13:39,817
Okay.

293
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:46,057
My dad is a good guy.

294
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:51,609
We've just never been
on the same page, you know?

295
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:55,724
My mother was the one
that I could talk to...

296
00:13:55,969 --> 00:13:58,045
same for him.

297
00:13:58,638 --> 00:14:02,138
So, without her,

298
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:04,909
we're both pretty useless.

299
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:13,084
Room 326.

300
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:14,586
Right.

301
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,928
Dr. Murphy called me in
for a second opinion.

302
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:28,187
Um, you need some pins in your arm.

303
00:14:28,212 --> 00:14:29,267
Why?

304
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:30,802
What's changed?

305
00:14:30,804 --> 00:14:33,037
Well, after studying
the radiology report,

306
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,606
given how bad the break is,

307
00:14:34,608 --> 00:14:36,608
we just think it would be a prudent step

308
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:39,877
to ensure an efficient and
thorough mending to the break.

309
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,013
Will I be able to play baseball again?

310
00:14:42,015 --> 00:14:43,548
Well, I don't see why not,

311
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,882
once it's completely healed,

312
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,451
after some physiotherapy.

313
00:14:46,453 --> 00:14:48,152
How long before I can pitch?

314
00:14:48,154 --> 00:14:49,988
It's hard to say.

315
00:14:55,901 --> 00:14:57,935
He wanted someone to lie for him.

316
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:01,887
And he picked you.

317
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:04,469
Merrill's son asked for personal advice.

318
00:15:04,471 --> 00:15:05,637
And he picked you.

319
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,272
I know, right?

320
00:15:07,274 --> 00:15:10,154
He's lying to his dad about something.

321
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:12,243
Yeah? What?

322
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:13,711
I don't know.

323
00:15:13,713 --> 00:15:15,179
You didn't ask?

324
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:18,593
It didn't seem relevant, medically.

325
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:21,686
You know it's not that difficult
to be a human being.

326
00:15:21,688 --> 00:15:24,022
Just tell him to "come clean,"

327
00:15:24,024 --> 00:15:26,391
"honesty is the best policy,"

328
00:15:26,393 --> 00:15:28,926
"a lie is a stone in your heart."

329
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,361
Who said the last one?

330
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:31,729
Me.

331
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:32,764
I made it up.

332
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:33,665
Hmm.

333
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:38,836
And... I got it.

334
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,446
He's anaphylactic.

335
00:15:42,471 --> 00:15:43,474
- Would you get me an epi?
- I'm coming out.

336
00:15:43,476 --> 00:15:45,376
- The throat's constricting.
- Pull the tube!

337
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:02,358
So, what's up with "Dr. Browne"?

338
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,608
She's Lea, isn't she?

339
00:16:06,009 --> 00:16:07,208
Claire is my colleague.

340
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:11,442
Oh, come on, I saw the way
you were looking at her.

341
00:16:11,538 --> 00:16:12,603
How?

342
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:16,708
I don't think I look like that.

343
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:19,877
Okay, so then why'd you
call her in for a "consult"?

344
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:21,577
Mm...

345
00:16:22,349 --> 00:16:23,859
Okay.

346
00:16:24,406 --> 00:16:27,941
Yes, she's better at talking
to people than I am.

347
00:16:27,998 --> 00:16:31,240
Wow. I counted like 50 tells there.

348
00:16:31,624 --> 00:16:33,888
- You really suck at lying.
- I know.

349
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,260
Too bad. It's an important social skill.

350
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:41,104
So how do you know when to lie?

351
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:42,834
When people need to know things,

352
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:43,801
they need to know.

353
00:16:43,803 --> 00:16:45,303
If they don't,

354
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:47,138
lie through your teeth
and feel good about it.

355
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,606
What if they need to know the truth,

356
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:49,941
but it'll hurt them?

357
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:56,681
Some can handle it, some can't.

358
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:59,117
So how do you know
who can and who can't?

359
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:00,318
You tell the truth.

360
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,854
If they like you after,
then you'll know.

361
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:04,122
If they don't?

362
00:17:04,124 --> 00:17:06,724
Then it doesn't really matter anyway.

363
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,064
You have cancer.

364
00:17:17,771 --> 00:17:20,938
Yeah, I know.

365
00:17:28,544 --> 00:17:31,151
My parents took me in for a sore leg.

366
00:17:31,237 --> 00:17:32,603
After a whole bunch of tests,

367
00:17:32,605 --> 00:17:33,771
they talked to the doctor,

368
00:17:33,773 --> 00:17:36,040
then came out and told me I was fine.

369
00:17:36,042 --> 00:17:38,760
That's it. Just "fine."

370
00:17:39,145 --> 00:17:42,244
The next day, they bought me a PS4.

371
00:17:42,749 --> 00:17:45,016
So I Googled my symptoms,

372
00:17:45,018 --> 00:17:47,385
and I narrowed it down to osteosarcoma

373
00:17:47,387 --> 00:17:48,728
or growing pains.

374
00:17:48,955 --> 00:17:52,056
Kids don't get gaming systems
for growing pains.

375
00:17:53,925 --> 00:17:57,628
Hey, it's okay.

376
00:18:00,098 --> 00:18:01,532
I'm not afraid to die.

377
00:18:01,534 --> 00:18:03,067
You're not?

378
00:18:03,069 --> 00:18:05,069
Well, I mean, the dying part will suck

379
00:18:05,071 --> 00:18:07,560
if it hurts, but...

380
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:10,975
I'm not afraid
about the actual death part.

381
00:18:10,977 --> 00:18:13,611
Because you believe
you're going to Heaven?

382
00:18:13,613 --> 00:18:15,146
Because I don't.

383
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:19,417
If I believe in Heaven,

384
00:18:19,419 --> 00:18:20,918
then I got to believe in God,

385
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,387
then I got to believe God made me sick.

386
00:18:23,389 --> 00:18:25,823
How messed up is that?

387
00:18:25,825 --> 00:18:29,375
It's just easier to think
that it's all random

388
00:18:29,462 --> 00:18:31,453
and when it's over,

389
00:18:31,587 --> 00:18:33,547
it's just...

390
00:18:36,335 --> 00:18:37,535
over.

391
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,175
So what about Lea?

392
00:18:44,177 --> 00:18:46,343
Where'd you guys meet?

393
00:18:46,345 --> 00:18:47,912
In the hallway.

394
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:53,317
That's a beautiful story.

395
00:18:53,319 --> 00:18:54,618
Yes.

396
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,353
She's my neighbor.

397
00:18:56,355 --> 00:18:58,921
Convenient.

398
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:00,725
He had another allergic reaction.

399
00:19:00,727 --> 00:19:03,327
- The pancreas?
- Merrill Wilks, yeah.

400
00:19:03,329 --> 00:19:05,830
And the second attack was even
more severe than the first.

401
00:19:05,832 --> 00:19:07,932
It coincided with biopsying
the pancreatic lesion,

402
00:19:07,934 --> 00:19:09,333
which now appears was a cyst.

403
00:19:09,335 --> 00:19:11,469
Well, now we know he's allergic
to whatever's in that cyst.

404
00:19:11,471 --> 00:19:13,104
We also that the next cyst that pops

405
00:19:13,106 --> 00:19:15,206
- will probably kill him.
- Well, if there is a next.

406
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:16,373
Let's run a couple tests,

407
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:17,875
see if there's any evidence
of parasites.

408
00:19:17,877 --> 00:19:19,210
And MRI his entire body...

409
00:19:19,212 --> 00:19:20,544
if we're lucky,
he only had the two cysts

410
00:19:20,546 --> 00:19:21,679
and he can go home.

411
00:19:25,535 --> 00:19:27,402
Are you looking for loopholes?

412
00:19:27,553 --> 00:19:29,019
Hoping to save Evan?

413
00:19:29,021 --> 00:19:31,122
Everyone makes mistakes.

414
00:19:31,124 --> 00:19:32,389
Which means you should double-check

415
00:19:32,391 --> 00:19:34,024
every file in the hospital.

416
00:19:34,026 --> 00:19:39,163
The oncologist flagged his
neutrophil count of 634 as low.

417
00:19:39,165 --> 00:19:40,097
That is low.

418
00:19:40,099 --> 00:19:41,165
Low normal.

419
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:43,361
I can still hear
the word "low" in there.

420
00:19:43,386 --> 00:19:44,853
Mm.

421
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,017
He's just a kid.

422
00:19:50,243 --> 00:19:53,172
I know how hard it is
to think of him dying.

423
00:19:53,346 --> 00:19:55,485
He's okay with that.

424
00:19:55,748 --> 00:19:57,348
I find that hard to believe.

425
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,582
We all die...

426
00:19:58,584 --> 00:20:00,818
if we accepted that, we'd be happier.

427
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:04,742
Maybe. But we're not good
with contentment.

428
00:20:05,391 --> 00:20:07,758
Fighting death is what keeps us alive.

429
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,100
Okay.

430
00:20:17,702 --> 00:20:19,436
We got a hit... Echinococcus.

431
00:20:19,438 --> 00:20:21,138
Echinococcus?

432
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,306
The cysts are filled with tapeworms?

433
00:20:22,308 --> 00:20:23,841
Cysts? There are more?

434
00:20:23,843 --> 00:20:25,543
- Three more?
- Four more.

435
00:20:25,545 --> 00:20:26,911
You missed the one in his brain.

436
00:20:30,149 --> 00:20:31,949
Dr. Glassman?

437
00:20:31,951 --> 00:20:33,184
Yeah?

438
00:20:33,186 --> 00:20:34,819
You used to be a neurosurgeon, right?

439
00:20:34,821 --> 00:20:36,220
So they say.

440
00:20:36,222 --> 00:20:37,521
Take this, will you?

441
00:20:39,591 --> 00:20:40,758
I need one.

442
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,992
Who would you recommend?

443
00:20:41,994 --> 00:20:43,460
What you got?

444
00:20:49,334 --> 00:20:50,935
Wow, that's cool.

445
00:20:53,605 --> 00:20:55,940
How the hell did I get tapeworms
in my head?

446
00:20:55,942 --> 00:20:57,908
No idea, but you do.

447
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:00,177
You can pick up the eggs
from coyotes or wolves.

448
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:02,146
You been hanging around
coyotes or wolves?

449
00:21:02,148 --> 00:21:03,447
I live in the suburbs...

450
00:21:03,449 --> 00:21:04,849
we don't even have a petting zoo.

451
00:21:04,851 --> 00:21:07,418
You might've had these cysts
for quite some time.

452
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,719
When one of them burst,

453
00:21:08,721 --> 00:21:10,888
that's what caused
the first allergic reaction.

454
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:12,790
Well, why did it burst?

455
00:21:12,792 --> 00:21:14,325
Why did it burst?

456
00:21:14,327 --> 00:21:17,828
Any sudden movements, twists,
turns, squeeze.

457
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:18,863
A hug?

458
00:21:18,865 --> 00:21:20,330
Could be.

459
00:21:21,801 --> 00:21:23,868
But you weren't there
for the second one.

460
00:21:26,037 --> 00:21:28,505
I punctured the cyst on your pancreas

461
00:21:28,507 --> 00:21:29,940
during the biopsy.

462
00:21:29,942 --> 00:21:32,610
As you've seen,
allergic reactions get worse

463
00:21:32,612 --> 00:21:33,677
each time they happen.

464
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,246
So a third one, that would be bad.

465
00:21:35,248 --> 00:21:36,747
That would be...

466
00:21:36,749 --> 00:21:37,848
That would be very bad.

467
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:39,817
So we're gonna have to surgically remove

468
00:21:39,819 --> 00:21:41,986
all the cysts intact.

469
00:21:41,988 --> 00:21:44,221
Dr. Glassman's
one of the most highly acclaimed

470
00:21:44,223 --> 00:21:45,289
neurosurgeons in the state.

471
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:46,657
You are very lucky to have him.

472
00:21:46,659 --> 00:21:50,694
And Dr. Kalu is fast becoming
a very accomplished flatterer.

473
00:21:50,696 --> 00:21:53,797
The cranial cyst, that is a big deal.

474
00:21:53,799 --> 00:21:56,300
We're gonna have to take off
the top of your skull.

475
00:21:56,302 --> 00:21:58,369
You'd be digging in to my brain?

476
00:21:58,371 --> 00:21:59,837
Well, yeah, pretty much.

477
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:00,871
With saline.

478
00:22:00,873 --> 00:22:02,606
We use it to gently displace the cyst,

479
00:22:02,608 --> 00:22:04,875
and then, poof, it magically pops out.

480
00:22:04,877 --> 00:22:06,110
Kind of like delivering a baby.

481
00:22:06,112 --> 00:22:08,746
You know, if childbirth were painless.

482
00:22:08,748 --> 00:22:11,770
And then we move on to the other cysts.

483
00:22:11,951 --> 00:22:14,218
Hey, we're gonna take good care of you.

484
00:23:07,665 --> 00:23:10,151

485

- Fractured arm?
- Yes.

498
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:50,400
You said he'd been diagnosed
with stage four osteosarcoma.

499
00:23:50,425 --> 00:23:53,244
Evan was diagnosed with the flu
eight months ago,

500
00:23:53,269 --> 00:23:54,822
but his symptoms were actually
a better fit

501
00:23:54,847 --> 00:23:56,113
with Epstein-Barr virus,

502
00:23:56,115 --> 00:23:58,149
which is linked to
Langerhans cell histiocytosis,

503
00:23:58,151 --> 00:23:59,684
which causes osteolytic lesions

504
00:23:59,686 --> 00:24:01,085
in the long bones of the upper limbs.

505
00:24:01,087 --> 00:24:02,820
And those lesions could be misdiagnosed

506
00:24:02,822 --> 00:24:04,021
as signs of osteosarcoma.

507
00:24:04,023 --> 00:24:05,466
- Yes.
- What about his brain tumor?

508
00:24:05,491 --> 00:24:08,139
Langerhans can also manifest
in the skull.

509
00:24:09,262 --> 00:24:10,661
Instead of a death sentence,

510
00:24:10,663 --> 00:24:11,929
he could have something
that could easily

511
00:24:11,931 --> 00:24:13,064
be treated with prednisone?

512
00:24:13,066 --> 00:24:16,434
Next, we need to do a bone-marrow
aspiration to confirm.

513
00:24:16,436 --> 00:24:17,735
I assume you've looked at his file.

514
00:24:17,737 --> 00:24:18,869
For a very long time.

515
00:24:18,871 --> 00:24:20,171
Well, there must've been a biopsy.

516
00:24:20,173 --> 00:24:21,439
What did the pathology report say?

517
00:24:21,441 --> 00:24:22,807
Yes. There were two biopsies.

518
00:24:22,809 --> 00:24:25,679
Both were positive for osteosarcoma.

519
00:24:26,412 --> 00:24:29,358
- Murphy...
- They could be false positives.

520
00:24:29,382 --> 00:24:30,848
Do you have any idea how unlikely it is

521
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:31,949
to have two false positives?

522
00:24:31,951 --> 00:24:33,117
0.3%.

523
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:34,719
Which we can comfortably
round off to "not likely."

524
00:24:34,721 --> 00:24:36,153
It is possible...

525
00:24:36,155 --> 00:24:38,322
Yes, but it means telling
the parents of a dying child

526
00:24:38,324 --> 00:24:40,446
that there's hope,
when really there isn't.

527
00:24:41,703 --> 00:24:43,369
Grab a shower and get ready for rounds.

528
00:24:49,668 --> 00:24:51,302
Wow.

529
00:24:51,304 --> 00:24:53,571
- Imaginative and creative.
- Yes.

530
00:24:53,573 --> 00:24:54,839
What are the chances you're right?

531
00:24:54,841 --> 00:24:55,940
0.3%.

532
00:24:55,942 --> 00:24:57,208
330 to 1.

533
00:24:57,210 --> 00:24:59,844
333 to 1.

534
00:24:59,846 --> 00:25:01,445
You really think that it's worth

535
00:25:01,447 --> 00:25:03,080
putting Evan's parents through all this?

536
00:25:03,082 --> 00:25:04,281
Of course.

537
00:25:04,283 --> 00:25:06,550
If we did this 333 times,

538
00:25:06,552 --> 00:25:08,953
we'd be giving false hope to 332 people

539
00:25:08,955 --> 00:25:10,421
for approximately four hours,

540
00:25:10,423 --> 00:25:11,689
and we'd save one life.

541
00:25:11,691 --> 00:25:14,042
Isn't that worth it?

542
00:25:14,067 --> 00:25:15,726
Anyway, Dr. Melendez won't let me

543
00:25:15,728 --> 00:25:17,294
ask for consent to test.

544
00:25:17,296 --> 00:25:20,164
What if I don't tell them
what I'm doing?

545
00:25:20,166 --> 00:25:22,400
A blatant ethics violation...
that's your solution?

546
00:25:22,402 --> 00:25:23,534
Yes.

547
00:25:23,536 --> 00:25:25,169
How do I do that?

548
00:25:29,976 --> 00:25:32,009
Well, uh,

549
00:25:32,011 --> 00:25:34,578
you do it and then don't tell anyone.

550
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,080
No one. If anyone asks...

551
00:25:36,082 --> 00:25:38,582
your attending noticed a low RBC count

552
00:25:38,584 --> 00:25:39,750
and needed to find the cause...

553
00:25:39,752 --> 00:25:42,420
that's it... no biggie.

554
00:25:43,423 --> 00:25:44,655
Hmm.

555
00:25:54,466 --> 00:25:57,668
You know Wilks' Grocery
on Santa Clara 17th?

556
00:25:57,670 --> 00:26:00,805
It's been an institution
for nearly 60 years.

557
00:26:00,807 --> 00:26:03,908
My grandparents started it in 1958,

558
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:06,510
and my wife and I took it over in '82.

559
00:26:06,512 --> 00:26:07,845
But when my wife got sick

560
00:26:07,847 --> 00:26:10,047
and I started talking to Kevin
about taking it over,

561
00:26:10,049 --> 00:26:12,683
he just... took off.

562
00:26:14,486 --> 00:26:15,820
To him, it was just a place

563
00:26:15,822 --> 00:26:17,922
to sell lettuce and toilet paper.

564
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:24,481
My father chairs a real-estate
development company in the U.K.

565
00:26:25,965 --> 00:26:27,264
Thought I'd be the perfect person

566
00:26:27,266 --> 00:26:28,933
to set up the U.S. office.

567
00:26:28,935 --> 00:26:31,368
You wanted to be in
the "helping profession," hmm?

568
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:34,105
I wanted to be in <i>my</i> profession.

569
00:26:34,107 --> 00:26:36,574
It's not about how small
or how big the venture is,

570
00:26:36,576 --> 00:26:38,476
it's about doing something that's yours.

571
00:26:41,546 --> 00:26:42,913
I guess.

572
00:26:49,287 --> 00:26:52,156
When he was little, we were inseparable.

573
00:26:54,727 --> 00:26:59,330
Ah, he used to love
to come to the store to "work."

574
00:27:02,301 --> 00:27:04,268
I even had a little apron
made for him...

575
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:06,459
had his name on it, too.

576
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:09,139
Still, you know, kids...

577
00:27:09,909 --> 00:27:11,250
grow up.

578
00:27:12,278 --> 00:27:15,398
I'm just grateful that he stayed
close to his mother.

579
00:27:16,192 --> 00:27:19,586
He could talk to her, tell her anything.

580
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,274
So could I.

581
00:27:23,556 --> 00:27:25,711
And when she went...

582
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,420
...I lost them both.

583
00:27:34,142 --> 00:27:36,175
Looks like he's back now.

584
00:27:36,262 --> 00:27:39,804
All I know is he ditched me
when I needed him.

585
00:27:42,108 --> 00:27:45,236
Well, you know,
as a wise person once said,

586
00:27:45,878 --> 00:27:48,330
"holding a grudge is a stone
in your heart."

587
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,720
What's that for?

588
00:27:56,722 --> 00:27:59,957
Local anaesthetic
for a bonemarrow aspiration.

589
00:27:59,959 --> 00:28:02,694
Why do I need a bonemarrow aspiration?

590
00:28:03,696 --> 00:28:05,663
My attending saw a low RBC count

591
00:28:05,665 --> 00:28:08,097
and wants to find the cause...

592
00:28:08,334 --> 00:28:09,668
no biggie.

593
00:28:09,973 --> 00:28:11,272
"No biggie"?

594
00:28:11,337 --> 00:28:12,808
You're lying.

595
00:28:12,905 --> 00:28:14,885
What's going on?

596
00:28:14,974 --> 00:28:17,208
You already told me
I have terminal cancer,

597
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:18,776
what's worse than that?

598
00:28:23,915 --> 00:28:25,216
You might not.

599
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:29,153
It might not be osteosarcoma...

600
00:28:29,155 --> 00:28:31,801
might be Langerhans cell histiocytosis,

601
00:28:31,858 --> 00:28:33,582
which is treatable.

602
00:28:33,693 --> 00:28:34,715
Treatable?

603
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,909
As in, I might not die?

604
00:28:36,996 --> 00:28:38,596
That's why I need to aspirate...

605
00:28:38,598 --> 00:28:39,830
to find out for sure.

606
00:28:39,832 --> 00:28:41,432
Do my parents know?

607
00:28:41,434 --> 00:28:44,651
Mm... I was told not
to get their hopes up.

608
00:28:45,404 --> 00:28:48,861
Then let's do it before they get back.

609
00:28:49,575 --> 00:28:51,361
Roll onto your side.

610
00:29:01,869 --> 00:29:04,121
Is there a Scout badge for aspirations?

611
00:29:05,191 --> 00:29:06,672
I think someone just made a joke.

612
00:29:10,374 --> 00:29:11,428
Hello.

613
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:13,297
- What are you doing?
- Painkiller.

614
00:29:13,299 --> 00:29:15,616
My arm hurts.

615
00:29:15,881 --> 00:29:17,001
That wouldn't explain

616
00:29:17,003 --> 00:29:19,203
why I'd be injecting your lumbar region.

617
00:29:23,675 --> 00:29:25,342
Okay. Yes, hello.

618
00:29:25,344 --> 00:29:28,894
I think Evan may have been
misdiagnosed with cancer.

619
00:29:29,649 --> 00:29:32,783
I think he has something
that creates bone lesions

620
00:29:32,785 --> 00:29:34,251
that look like osteosarcoma.

621
00:29:34,253 --> 00:29:36,253
It's a small chance, 0.3%, but I...

622
00:29:36,255 --> 00:29:39,233
You... You told Evan that he has cancer?

623
00:29:40,026 --> 00:29:41,692
And now you are telling him... and us...

624
00:29:41,694 --> 00:29:42,626
that he doesn't?

625
00:29:42,628 --> 00:29:43,961
I'm telling you he might not.

626
00:29:43,963 --> 00:29:45,963
That's why I need
to perform this aspiration.

627
00:29:45,965 --> 00:29:47,932
He says whatever I have
might be treatable.

628
00:29:47,934 --> 00:29:50,100
- Are you insane?
- No. I am not insane.

629
00:29:50,102 --> 00:29:51,168
I thought you'd be happy.

630
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:52,536
There is a significant link between

631
00:29:52,538 --> 00:29:54,204
Langerhans cell histiocytosis and...

632
00:29:54,206 --> 00:29:56,106
Go! Get out!

633
00:29:58,301 --> 00:29:59,935
Let me get you some water.

634
00:30:05,361 --> 00:30:06,517
- Oh, my God!
- Hands right here...

635
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:08,118
All right, buddy. Right here!

636
00:30:08,189 --> 00:30:09,867
Respiratory, stat!

637
00:30:14,341 --> 00:30:16,174
He has a massive embolus,

638
00:30:16,176 --> 00:30:18,210
probably thrown from his fracture.

639
00:30:18,212 --> 00:30:19,745
It's located at the bifurcation

640
00:30:19,747 --> 00:30:21,280
of the pulmonary arteries.

641
00:30:21,282 --> 00:30:22,814
He's close to hemodynamic collapse.

642
00:30:22,816 --> 00:30:24,082
Yeah, no kidding.

643
00:30:24,084 --> 00:30:25,684
I'd like to assist.

644
00:30:25,686 --> 00:30:26,985
Not a chance.

645
00:30:26,987 --> 00:30:29,398
Okay. I'd like to assist.

646
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:31,456
You're obviously too close to the case.

647
00:30:31,458 --> 00:30:33,659
I think I'm just
the right amount of close.

648
00:30:33,661 --> 00:30:35,160
Murphy, you lied to the parents

649
00:30:35,162 --> 00:30:37,029
just so you could try
to prove your ridiculous theory.

650
00:30:37,031 --> 00:30:38,806
You're too damn close.

651
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:42,379
Saddle embolism, scrub in.

652
00:30:49,877 --> 00:30:51,677
We have to get rid of
the embolus before he arrests.

653
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:53,466
His heart is barely pumping blood.

654
00:30:53,491 --> 00:30:54,959
I can feel the pulmonary artery...

655
00:30:54,984 --> 00:30:57,314
I just need to find
the obstruction... there!

656
00:30:57,339 --> 00:30:58,317
I got it.

657
00:30:58,319 --> 00:30:59,751
- Knife.
- Knife.

658
00:30:59,753 --> 00:31:01,219
EKG is showing right heart strain.

659
00:31:01,221 --> 00:31:02,321
He can't take this much longer.

660
00:31:02,323 --> 00:31:03,998
I know, but if I move any quicker,

661
00:31:04,023 --> 00:31:06,425
I could nick the left main artery
and kill the boy.

662
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:14,066
The phrase "no biggie" gave me away.

663
00:31:14,068 --> 00:31:16,168
You really got to learn
how to lie, Shaun.

664
00:31:18,112 --> 00:31:19,646
Am I in trouble?

665
00:31:19,773 --> 00:31:21,205
Yes.

666
00:31:22,309 --> 00:31:24,324
Unless you're right.

667
00:31:24,478 --> 00:31:26,345
If I'm wrong, they shouldn't be upset.

668
00:31:26,347 --> 00:31:28,621
They know it's highly unlikely.

669
00:31:30,684 --> 00:31:32,738
False hope, Shaun...

670
00:31:32,953 --> 00:31:34,776
it's just plain cruel.

671
00:31:51,005 --> 00:31:52,907
Hey.

672
00:31:53,407 --> 00:31:55,540
He talk to you?

673
00:31:56,218 --> 00:31:58,085
Did you talk to him?

674
00:31:58,212 --> 00:31:59,845
I don't know what to tell him.

675
00:32:05,155 --> 00:32:06,789
You love your father, don't you?

676
00:32:06,854 --> 00:32:08,286
Yeah, of course.

677
00:32:08,288 --> 00:32:10,555
Right. Well, he's about to go
in for brain surgery.

678
00:32:10,557 --> 00:32:12,550
There's huge risks involved.

679
00:32:12,603 --> 00:32:13,769
Whatever this lie is,

680
00:32:13,794 --> 00:32:14,893
can you live the rest of your life

681
00:32:14,895 --> 00:32:16,461
knowing you kept it from him?

682
00:32:29,075 --> 00:32:31,714
My... My girlfriend wasn't sick.

683
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:34,745
Okay? She dumped me.

684
00:32:34,915 --> 00:32:36,281
She's married with two kids...

685
00:32:36,283 --> 00:32:38,409
had no intention of leaving them.

686
00:32:38,752 --> 00:32:39,918
I-I was an idiot.

687
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,402
You got your heart broken,
that's the problem here?

688
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:44,194
No... no, Dad.

689
00:32:44,258 --> 00:32:45,338
The problem is...

690
00:32:46,393 --> 00:32:47,759
I didn't run away to Thailand

691
00:32:47,761 --> 00:32:51,354
because I thought
Wilks' Grocery was beneath me.

692
00:32:53,067 --> 00:32:55,167
I was afraid that I would never be able

693
00:32:55,169 --> 00:32:57,276
to fill your shoes...

694
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:01,231
And then I proved myself right.

695
00:33:17,458 --> 00:33:19,391
Left pulmonary artery's open.

696
00:33:19,393 --> 00:33:20,525
Ring Forceps.

697
00:33:22,689 --> 00:33:24,530
Ring Forceps.

698
00:33:26,954 --> 00:33:28,233
Come on.

699
00:33:31,003 --> 00:33:32,304
Got it.

700
00:33:35,642 --> 00:33:37,476
EKG is normalizing.

701
00:33:37,501 --> 00:33:39,778
He's okay. Nice job.

702
00:33:39,803 --> 00:33:41,879
All right,
flush the left pulmonary artery

703
00:33:41,938 --> 00:33:43,910
- and close him up.
- Okay.

704
00:33:50,257 --> 00:33:53,020
Um... Dr. Melendez...

705
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,893
Take a look at this.

706
00:34:23,022 --> 00:34:26,169
Recycling... Shaun, very responsible.

707
00:34:27,261 --> 00:34:28,880
It's a book.

708
00:34:29,563 --> 00:34:30,862
I appreciate that.

709
00:34:41,041 --> 00:34:42,374
Thanks, Shaun.

710
00:34:47,684 --> 00:34:48,739
Hey.

711
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:56,489
We got the embolism.

712
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:59,309
He's in recovery and he's doing fine.

713
00:35:00,161 --> 00:35:01,660
But while we were in there,

714
00:35:01,662 --> 00:35:03,562
we did find something else.

715
00:35:03,564 --> 00:35:05,363
Lesions on his ribs.

716
00:35:08,734 --> 00:35:11,291
Irrefutable proof of osteosarcoma.

717
00:35:11,939 --> 00:35:14,206
It's metastasized to his chest cavity.

718
00:35:16,709 --> 00:35:18,577
I'm sorry.

719
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:29,150
I'm very sorry.

720
00:35:48,818 --> 00:35:51,888
Give that a nice, warm saline bath.

721
00:35:53,336 --> 00:35:55,228
Forceps and Taylor scissors, please.

722
00:35:55,252 --> 00:35:57,466
- Forceps and scissors.
- Thank you.

723
00:36:06,511 --> 00:36:07,743
Look at that.

724
00:36:07,745 --> 00:36:09,671
That's what built the pyramids,

725
00:36:10,038 --> 00:36:12,046
painted the Mona Lisa,

726
00:36:12,617 --> 00:36:15,225
invented the Internet.

727
00:36:16,738 --> 00:36:19,672
And there is our interloper.

728
00:36:19,753 --> 00:36:21,887
Squeezeball please, Deidre.

729
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,059
Squeezeball?

730
00:36:23,061 --> 00:36:25,158
His name for it, not ours.

731
00:36:25,263 --> 00:36:29,023
The saline gently displaces the cyst

732
00:36:29,477 --> 00:36:31,778
and coaxes it out
of its little hiding place...

733
00:36:31,803 --> 00:36:36,218
Hopefully in one piece
so we don't have to call 911.

734
00:36:37,131 --> 00:36:38,929
Come on, now...

735
00:36:39,177 --> 00:36:41,218
Tray, please.

736
00:36:41,433 --> 00:36:43,000
There we go...

737
00:36:43,081 --> 00:36:44,976
And...

738
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:47,398
And you got it.

739
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:49,085
Got it.

740
00:36:50,021 --> 00:36:51,921
He has his father's eyes.

741
00:36:51,923 --> 00:36:53,623
That was incredible.

742
00:36:53,625 --> 00:36:55,581
One down, three to go...

743
00:37:07,906 --> 00:37:10,406
Hey. There he is.

744
00:37:10,408 --> 00:37:11,631
Hi, Sweetie.

745
00:37:13,093 --> 00:37:14,726
What's the matter?

746
00:37:14,775 --> 00:37:15,841
Nothing.

747
00:37:15,914 --> 00:37:19,139
We're just happy you did so great.

748
00:37:21,051 --> 00:37:23,155
You had what's called an embolism.

749
00:37:23,821 --> 00:37:25,959
It clogged an artery in your lungs.

750
00:37:26,224 --> 00:37:28,256
But the good news is they got it.

751
00:37:28,726 --> 00:37:31,217
And you're gonna be just fine.

752
00:37:31,562 --> 00:37:32,662
Still...

753
00:37:32,664 --> 00:37:34,784
too bad about the cancer, huh?

754
00:37:34,809 --> 00:37:36,018
No, no, no, no.

755
00:37:36,043 --> 00:37:38,034
The doctor did not know
what he was talking about...

756
00:37:38,036 --> 00:37:39,936
Dad, I know all about it.

757
00:37:39,938 --> 00:37:42,410
I have for a long time.

758
00:37:44,343 --> 00:37:45,800
Well, I...

759
00:37:49,046 --> 00:37:51,549
I am so sorry.

760
00:37:51,649 --> 00:37:53,393
It's okay.

761
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:09,598
Because I'm not gonna be alone.

762
00:38:11,168 --> 00:38:13,245
Grandma's gonna be there, too.

763
00:38:14,439 --> 00:38:16,440
Auntie Arlene.

764
00:38:18,219 --> 00:38:21,487
Uncle Jim, if he figured out
how to stop swearing.

765
00:38:27,986 --> 00:38:29,618
I'll get you some water, buddy.

766
00:38:40,498 --> 00:38:42,849
So, I took Penny for a walk...

767
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,333
just around the block.

768
00:38:46,703 --> 00:38:49,472
And I picked her up
some of those rawhide treats,

769
00:38:49,474 --> 00:38:51,403
you know...

770
00:38:52,643 --> 00:38:54,744
the ones that Mom
used to like to give to her.

771
00:39:01,051 --> 00:39:02,873
I miss her, Dad.

772
00:39:32,283 --> 00:39:33,716
Coast is clear?

773
00:39:39,991 --> 00:39:40,990
Yes.

774
00:39:40,992 --> 00:39:42,774
Thank you.

775
00:39:42,926 --> 00:39:44,559
Mm, I was wrong.

776
00:39:44,749 --> 00:39:45,914
You tried.

777
00:39:45,963 --> 00:39:47,363
I was wrong.

778
00:39:49,166 --> 00:39:50,593
Your parents hate me.

779
00:39:50,618 --> 00:39:51,667
I know.

780
00:39:51,669 --> 00:39:53,969
- I gave you false hope.
- Yeah.

781
00:39:53,971 --> 00:39:56,672
But for a minute there,
it was pretty awesome.

782
00:39:59,709 --> 00:40:01,744
I'm going to ask you for a favor.

783
00:40:04,247 --> 00:40:06,935
Well, I'm not giving away
my Make-A-Wish.

784
00:40:07,016 --> 00:40:09,450
Mm, would you mind
if I read you something?

785
00:40:09,554 --> 00:40:11,307
It's not long.

786
00:40:11,422 --> 00:40:13,198
That I can do.

787
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,721
"Atticus was right.

788
00:40:25,503 --> 00:40:28,070
"One time he said
you never really know a man

789
00:40:28,135 --> 00:40:31,478
"until you stand in his shoes
and walk around in them.

790
00:40:31,676 --> 00:40:34,392
"Just standing
on the Radley porch was enough.

791
00:40:34,445 --> 00:40:35,845
"The streetlights were fuzzy

792
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:37,813
"from the fine rain that was falling.

793
00:40:37,868 --> 00:40:40,906
"As I made my way home, I felt very old."

794
00:41:03,185 --> 00:41:05,677
"... while he hadn't done
any of those things,

795
00:41:05,778 --> 00:41:08,463
"Atticus, he was real nice.

796
00:41:08,846 --> 00:41:10,212
"His hands were under my chin,

797
00:41:10,214 --> 00:41:11,514
"pulling up the cover,

798
00:41:11,516 --> 00:41:13,742
"tucking it around me.

799
00:41:13,818 --> 00:41:16,672
"Most people are, Scout,
when you finally see them."

800
00:41:17,155 --> 00:41:20,406
"He turned out the light
and went into Jem's room.

801
00:41:20,458 --> 00:41:22,151
"He would be there all night,

802
00:41:22,193 --> 00:41:25,708
"and he would be there when Jem
waked up in the morning."

803
00:41:30,701 --> 00:41:32,776
Sounds like a good book.

804
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:35,349
Could've used a spoiler alert, though.

805
00:41:42,046 --> 00:41:43,939
Thank you.

806
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:56,220
That's all.
