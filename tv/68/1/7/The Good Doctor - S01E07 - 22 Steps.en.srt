- He's wasted potential on the bench.
- Yes.

818
00:41:11,397 --> 00:41:14,832
Anyway, the link to the bank
will help make automatic...

819
00:41:14,834 --> 00:41:16,400
- Oh! [LAUGHS]
- Oh!

820
00:41:16,402 --> 00:41:17,668
Did you see that?

821
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:20,337
He pinned it against
his helmet... even with the PI!

822
00:41:20,339 --> 00:41:21,906
I want to go to the Super Bowl.

823
00:41:21,908 --> 00:41:23,941
Okay, see,
that's exactly the kind of thing

824
00:41:23,943 --> 00:41:25,843
you have to think about before you buy.

825
00:41:25,845 --> 00:41:27,878
Tickets are very expensive.

826
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,181
- Oh, hoo-hoo-hoo!
- [LAUGHS]

827
00:41:32,751 --> 00:41:34,618
You know... You know what? You should go.

828
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:36,020
I should go. We should go.

829
00:41:36,022 --> 00:41:36,921
Okay.

830
00:41:36,923 --> 00:41:38,589
Excuse me. [CHUCKLES]

831
00:41:38,591 --> 00:41:41,058
Uh, it's almost closing time, so...

832
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:43,260
I'd like to buy this TV.

833
00:41:46,798 --> 00:41:48,799
...stay as long as you like.
