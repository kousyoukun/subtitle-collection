1
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,980
Come on. Is the system down?

2
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,190
Worked fine for me.

3
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,390
I don't have time for this.

4
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:30,870
How you doing?

5
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:32,480
The computer is not working.

6
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:34,000
That's not what I'm talking about.

7
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,760
I know. I'm fine.

8
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,090
A patient died because of something you did.

9
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:41,580
I think it's safe to say the one thing you are not is "Fine."

10
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,080
I'm dealing.

11
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:46,030
How exactly are you dealing?

12
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:47,910
I'm getting back to work,

13
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,870
I have a diabetic toe to debride,

14
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,310
and I'm putting it behind me.

15
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:55,600
How do you do that -- put it behind you?

16
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,020
By moving forward.

17
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,630
- I appreciate your concern. - You're welcome.

18
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:04,760
I'm gonna make an appointment for you for grief counseling.

19
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,820
Dr. Mohan -- She's an expert in dealing with hospital staff

20
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:11,300
who have experienced stressful events.

21
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:14,430
That's not necessary.

22
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,740
You agree you had a "Stressful event"?

23
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:19,930
And while I am comforted

24
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:23,590
by your commitment to move forward by not looking back,

25
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,700
I still want you to see Dr. Mohan.

26
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:28,110
If she says that you are fine,

27
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,620
then -- and only then -- can you go back to surgery.

28
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:32,200
It's working now.

29
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,620
You just have to be patient.

30
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,140
Heart rate 36.

31
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:44,500
Push another five milligrams of morphine and prep a nitro drip.

32
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,230
We need atropine on board stat.

33
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,190
What do you got for me?

34
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,900
An MI with severe bradycardia.

35
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,580
He's had aspirin, nitro,

36
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,780
and now we're trying to give him a real rate with atropine.

37
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,710
Cardiology see him?

38
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:54,880
He's got a broken pacemaker

39
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,270
and probably needs his coronary arteries cleared --

40
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:59,910
feels like a triple bypass, but you're the expert.

41
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,750
BNP is sky high.

42
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:03,650
What do you see?

43
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:06,580
His ventricles are barely pumping.

44
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,810
He's had two massive prior MIs.

45
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:10,920
End stage heart failure.

46
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,580
His heart's way beyond repair.

47
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,530
What are our options?

48
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,060
He's 73 years old.

49
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:18,110
His age is an absolute contraindication for transplant.

50
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,020
- He's dying. - Well, he's not dead yet.

51
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:20,930
What else?

52
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:23,380
How about cardiac resynchronization?

53
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,770
That will get what's left of both ventricles working together.

54
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,160
A biventricular pacer?

55
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,310
It should make him feel a little better in the few months he's got left.

56
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:34,110
His rate drops any lower, he'll arrest.

57
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:36,380
Claire, prep his jugular to float in a temporary pacemaker.

58
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,900
Shaun, call up to the cath lab

59
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,480
and have them get an estimate on how long it'll take

60
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,120
to get the bi-pacer in house.

61
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,500
Something wrong?

62
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:50,560
Not at all.

63
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,720
Just a little bit too much coffee this morning.

64
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,140
Let's go. Do it now.

65
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,390
Restraints, please!

66
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,970
I don't want to get stuck with a needle.

67
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:15,540
You're scaring him.

68
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,530
You're scaring him.

69
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:25,100
Haldol, five milligrams.

70
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:27,130
You're scaring him!

71
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,670
- Who are you? - Dr. Shaun Murphy.

72
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,200
This patient is psychotic, Dr. Murphy.

73
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,770
He's not psychotic.

74
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,930
You don't like people touching you.

75
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,770
He's not psychotic. He's autistic.

76
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,520
You're being an excellent patient.

77
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,650
Okay. We're finished.

78
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,410
You're s-same as...

79
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:11,750
me.

80
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,890
Can we release his hands?

81
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:18,160
Dr. Murphy? His hands?

82
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,330
I'm here, son -- Mom and Dad are here.

83
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:24,810
You can let go of his hands. He won't hurt you.

84
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:32,240
Wrong stop. Wrong stop.

85
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,840
Can someone tell me what happened?

86
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:38,630
Liam has a 5.4 centimeter laceration on his forehead,

87
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,070
probably from a fall.

88
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:44,140
The wound was infiltrated with five milliliters of 1% lidocaine...

89
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,450
7 -- 7 single-interrupted 5-0 Prolene sutures.

90
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:51,590
He will have a small scar,

91
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:54,170
but no other long-term effects from this injury.

92
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:55,590
You're my son's doctor.

93
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,230
I am. Dr. Shaun Murphy -- "Shaun" with a U.

94
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:02,170
Got lost -- got lost, got lost, got lost, got lost!

95
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:06,650
- Yes, yes. Yes. But you're okay. - Got lost. Got lost, got lost.

96
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:08,270
You won't be taking that bus again.

97
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,900
This light is too bright.

98
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,200
These rooms make him anxious. Can we take him home?

99
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:12,900
No.

100
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,420
Your son is jaundiced,

101
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:18,130
clenching his right abdominal muscles when touched and febrile.

102
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:19,350
He should not go home.

103
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:31,630
Why am I here?

104
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,110
Your pacemaker malfunctioned.

105
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:35,660
You had a heart attack.

106
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,490
I...I think I get that part.

107
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,560
Your neighbor's gardener saw you on the ground inside your house --

108
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,370
called 911, saved your life.

109
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,760
Well, I must remember to thank him.

110
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,740
How old are you?

111
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:56,560
Me?

112
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,790
I know how old I am.

113
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,680
I'm 28.

114
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:04,560
We have, uh, a biventricular pacer on its way,

115
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,110
and it's gonna make you feel a lot better.

116
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:08,000
Is it?

117
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:12,940
I will be back to prep you for surgery.

118
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:18,030
Liam has elevated bilirubin and liver enzymes,

119
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:20,120
a white cell count of 23.

120
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:24,580
Abdominal ultrasound shows dilatation of the bile ducts.

121
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,650
Sounds like ascending cholangitis --

122
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:29,890
can lead to sepsis if the bacteria gain access to his blood.

123
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:30,990
Is he stable now?

124
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,510
Yes, his vital signs are stable.

125
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:36,340
Cause could be anything from cancer to diet, so --

126
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,870
High-fat diets can cause obstructive gallstones,

127
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,570
which could have set the whole thing off.

128
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,130
Do an ERCP to clear him.

129
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:47,470
After that, a few weeks of broad spectrum antibiotics

130
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:48,850
should take care of things.

131
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,740
I want you help.

132
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,550
With what?

133
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,720
Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangio-Pancreatography.

134
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,680
ERCP? Why?

135
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,290
You've done those before, Shaun.

136
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,800
You're good with people who have autism.

137
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:37,010
Okay, Glen, let's get this, star...ted

138
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,800
Glen, you almost finished?

139
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,040
It's Dr. Kalu.

140
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,750
Glen?

141
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:00,680
Yeah, we have a code green.

142
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:03,520
Patient is Caucasian, male, 185 pounds.

143
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,500
Shaun, can you talk to him or something?

144
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,000
I can't push the Midazolam.

145
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:23,760
Four lights...four doors.

146
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,460
Yes. Lots of things.

147
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:29,460
32, 8. 32, 8.

148
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,150
32 is the number of cabinet windows,

149
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,750
and 8 is the number of handles.

150
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:40,220
the end title's CO2 is rising.

151
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,760
He needs oxygen. He has respiratory depression.

152
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,550
It's a common reaction to Midazolam.

153
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,430
CO2 is coming down.

154
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:55,060
- You can proceed, Claire. - Thank you.

155
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,170
Have you been around a lot of other autistic people?

156
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:09,400
I've never met someone with autism.

157
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,200
So, it must be nice to spend some time around Liam, then.

158
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:14,370
Why?

159
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:15,870
Why would that be nice?

160
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:19,320
Okay.

161
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,520
There are no stones.

162
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,880
Where are the stones?

163
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:28,500
And there is scarring.

164
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:31,400
This has nothing to do with gallstones.

165
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,800
The entire biliary tree is so thick with scarring

166
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,420
we can't even get the camera through.

167
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:43,840
The differential diagnosis for biliary tree scarring includes

168
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:47,840
primary sclerosing cholangitis, liver failure,

169
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,880
secondary to primary biliary cirrhosis --

170
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:52,740
Yeah, Shaun, we can add a few cancers to that list as well --

171
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,130
It's a long and ugly one.

172
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:55,880
Find another way to figure out what it is.

173
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,040
We could do an MRI.

174
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,080
No, we couldn't.

175
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:02,590
It's not possible.

176
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:03,940
That's the first time I've ever heard you say that.

177
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,670
- Liam is stimming. - Stimming?

178
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:09,010
The tics and spasms are a neurological response to stress.

179
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:11,000
If he's doing an MRI, there is stress --

180
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,350
if there is stress, he won't keep still,

181
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,910
if he wont' keep still, we can't do an MRI.

182
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,580
Therefore, it is impossible.

183
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,200
Maybe if you just keep talking to him like that,

184
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,240
he'll doze off and it'll all be simple.

185
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:21,680
Give him a mild sedative.

186
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:24,390
He didn't respond well to Midazolam during ERCP --

187
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,660
depresses his breathing.

188
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,340
His respiratory saturation can't be properly monitored inside --

189
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,150
I get it.

190
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,070
He could die in the MRI and we wouldn't know.

191
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:33,380
You're just gonna have to find a different way to calm him.

192
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,490
Okay. We'll do it.

193
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:36,500
Guess he has an idea.

194
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,440
We have a code green.

195
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:43,830
Patient is a Caucasian male, 73 years of age.

196
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,620
Shaun, what are you doing?

197
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,500
Counting.

198
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:52,220
- Counting what? - Distance.

199
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,430
Why?

200
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:57,450
I want $1,643.

201
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,350
You can get that by counting?

202
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:02,520
That's why you're alone and pacing in this room?

203
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:04,880
What do you want the money for?

204
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,430
I want to buy a television.

205
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:08,370
$1,600 for a television?

206
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:10,900
And 43. I am a surgeon. I get paychecks.

207
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,440
You're not a surgeon yet. You're a surgical resident.

208
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,140
Ah, there's a big difference in the paycheck there, pal.

209
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,250
I'm not a child, pal.

210
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,110
How 'bout $1,000 for a television?

211
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:25,010
No. The one I want is $1,643, okay?

212
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:26,930
I know, but you have a budget.

213
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,960
- A budget. You -- - Uh, rent, food, bills to pay.

214
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,220
I should do my own budget. I have an MRI to do.

215
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:45,290
These are live feeds -- entrances, E.R., receiving dock.

216
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:46,970
If your patient had left, we would've seen it.

217
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:47,970
Then where'd he go?

218
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:50,520
A freight elevator, but we don't have cams in the freights,

219
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,850
and he doesn't pop back up.

220
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:55,250
So, we're dealing with an alien abduction here?

221
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:58,670
Sorry.

222
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,900
We don't have cams on the freight elevators

223
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,210
on levels one, four and five, and the basement.

224
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:04,840
And you got people looking on those floors?

225
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,190
We've covered four and five, and we're moving on to one.

226
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:38,220
What's in the basement?

227
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,960
Pediatric patient lost a blanket --

228
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,490
I'm just gonna check lost and found.

229
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,290
That's nice of you.

230
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:47,890
While you're there,

231
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:50,810
you might want to check if they found your code green.

232
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,260
This is Doctor...

233
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,820
This is Shaun.

234
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,860
I can hear you when you speak.

235
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:14,090
I was thinking about something.

236
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,270
There are 24 steps from the ambulance to the E.R.

237
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:25,300
Please turn down the lights. That helps calm him.

238
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:30,970
There are 24 steps from the ambulance to the E.R.

239
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:37,880
There are 22 steps from the ambulance to the E.R.

240
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,440
He has very long strides.

241
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:43,130
Yes.

242
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:47,270
There are 22 steps from the ambulance to the E.R.

243
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:59,040
There are 37 steps from the elevator to room 405.

244
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,020
There are 37 steps

245
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:06,400
from the elevator to room 405.

246
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,320
In room 405, there are 6 steps to the sink...

247
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,170
6 steps to the sink.

248
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:15,400
We're getting good images.

249
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:20,240
It's amazing how accomplished you are for someone with ASD.

250
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,310
Three steps to the window.

251
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:24,630
Three steps to --

252
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:26,620
Three...

253
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:33,290
It's seven steps -- It's seven steps to the door.

254
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:36,270
Liam, there are seven steps to the door.

255
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,020
You need to get him out.

256
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,070
Just a little more time.

257
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:41,060
He's scared.

258
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,790
It's okay to be scared. We need to finish this.

259
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:45,130
- Seven - You're doing wonderfully, honey.

260
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:48,960
Just breathe. Just breathe.

261
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,130
No, it's seven steps to the door.

262
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,400
Glen?

263
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,100
Glen?

264
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:32,330
Glen?

265
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:38,480
Glen?

266
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,760
It's Dr. Kalu.

267
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,370
Let's get you upstairs.

268
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,710
Go away.

269
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,670
We're gonna get your new pacer in.

270
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:48,710
Don't you get it?

271
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:52,310
I broke my pacer on purpose.

272
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,660
I want to die.

273
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,460
With a new pacemaker, maybe you'll feel better.

274
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,810
So, I'll be cured?

275
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,470
Good as new?

276
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,290
Well, it'll reduce your pain, and then hopefully --

277
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:16,320
You think this is the first time I've heard that?

278
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:18,900
It's always the "Next best thing."

279
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:25,430
The truth is I'll just keep getting worse.

280
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:27,540
I know it, you know it.

281
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,220
Do you have any family you can talk to?

282
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:32,650
Brother's dead. I don't have a wife.

283
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,900
So, no, there's no one around to nag me

284
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,730
into doing what you want.

285
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:39,610
We have great counseling services here.

286
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:42,300
I'm in pain, 28 --

287
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:43,990
all the time.

288
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,380
Talk therapy gonna talk that away?

289
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,770
Let's get you upstairs.

290
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:49,450
You color's not good, and your lungs are crackling,

291
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,870
which means there's fluid building in --

292
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,110
I know my...

293
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,970
I know my rights.

294
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,320
I don't have to get treatment if I don't want it.

295
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:59,880
The minute I catch my breath, I'm gonna walk out of here,

296
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:03,300
so you can just leave.

297
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,200
I'm not leaving.

298
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:28,270
We can't treat it until we find the underlying cause.

299
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:29,170
How do you do that?

300
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:32,210
Surgically -- It's called "Exploratory laparoscopy."

301
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:35,520
We use a camera to navigate Liam's midsection.

302
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:38,000
There are significant risks --

303
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:40,160
perforation of an organ,

304
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:42,860
accidental spread seeding malignancy.

305
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:43,830
And you have to do this

306
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:46,460
because he can't stay still during an MRI?

307
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,770
You obviously know your son better than I do.

308
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,370
Do you think we should try again?

309
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,240
So, Shaun told me he's getting a TV --

310
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,050
70 inches, all the works.

311
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:16,090
Is he now?

312
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:17,840
It's just a TV.

313
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,390
It's not about a TV.

314
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,010
Why are you so worried about him?

315
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,660
He showed up late for work half a dozen times,

316
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,040
he calls me 2:00 in the morning

317
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,550
'cause he can't find a screwdriver,

318
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:29,370
and his superintendent wants to kick him out of his building.

319
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:31,290
- Did you show up? - What?

320
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:32,470
At 2:00 in the morning when he called you

321
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:34,360
about a lost screwdriver,

322
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,210
did you show up?

323
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,420
He was frantic. I didn't know what he was gonna do.

324
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,280
There are 47 residents here,

325
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,290
and all of them show up late sometimes,

326
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:43,400
all of them make mistakes,

327
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,250
and hopefully, all of them learn.

328
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:48,110
If you want to worry about Shaun, fine.

329
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,570
But you fought to hire him

330
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:51,770
because you know he can learn.

331
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:55,430
The question is, are you willing to let him?

332
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:06,550
Shaun?

333
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,800
I can see the pixelation.

334
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,660
- That's great. Listen. - It's not great.

335
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,180
It's not good.

336
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,600
On a high-quality display,

337
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:18,450
the human eye at 20/20 cannot detect the pixels.

338
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:24,410
You disappeared after the failed MRI.

339
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:27,100
I failed.

340
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:30,820
Yeah, see, I don't think it's about that.

341
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:34,370
You were hesitant with this kid even before that.

342
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:37,190
You asked me to the ERCP.

343
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:41,070
Doctors don't have to like their patients, Claire.

344
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:44,780
- You don't like him? - I don't know him.

345
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:47,500
Shaun, there's something else going on here.

346
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,400
- I know you know that. - No. Nu-- Nu-huh.

347
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,870
He has the same condition you have.

348
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:55,520
You have never met anyone with --

349
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,850
Do you like all people with psoriasis?

350
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I don't have --

351
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Yes, you do.

352
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:04,430
And you can never get rid of it.

353
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:05,860
Okay.

354
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,340
It's too bad you don't like him,

355
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,290
because I think he likes you.

356
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,730
Not only that, I think he looks up to you.

357
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:15,190
So you know how he thinks?

358
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:18,300
Well, not as much as you probably do.

359
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:25,720
What are you waiting for?

360
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:28,720
For you to pass out.

361
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:33,240
Judging by the size your ankles...

362
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:36,520
that shouldn't be too long from now.

363
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,940
Then hopefully I can get you upstairs before you die.

364
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:43,330
Why do you give such a damn about what I do with my life?

365
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,730
I don't know, Glen.

366
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,670
Why'd you want to die so bad?

367
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:54,610
I've lived.

368
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,410
I've had decent jobs,

369
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,690
and I've had jobs that went nowhere.

370
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,400
Had a good roof over my head,

371
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,530
and I've had that good roof taken away from me.

372
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:10,180
I loved a girl, and I got married.

373
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,420
The 20 happiest years of my life...

374
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,070
then she died.

375
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:20,330
And now I'm alone

376
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,140
and in pain.

377
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:28,530
Feels like the end of the story.

378
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:34,120
I understand.

379
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,250
Yeah?

380
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:39,410
You've had some tough times, too, 28?

381
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:46,090
Nobody understands what it's like to be so good-looking and successful?

382
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,470
I was raised by nannies and housekeepers.

383
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:50,980
Oh, my God.

384
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,350
You're an ass.

385
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,960
Your point is you didn't suffer

386
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:56,370
because you were good-looking and smart --

387
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,990
you suffered because you were rich?

388
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:04,900
The only time I ever saw my parents was Christmas.

389
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,970
Seriously, the story continues?

390
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,190
They had this big party every year,

391
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:12,840
and wherever they were traveling they'd always fly home for it.

392
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,850
And I'd have to come home, too,

393
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:18,900
from whatever school they sent me off to.

394
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:23,440
When I was 18, I decided that I was fed up.

395
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:28,020
I was a man, done being their son.

396
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,450
And I was gonna tell them publicly,

397
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,190
tell all their friends what horrible people they were.

398
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:39,400
So I came home from school, and I knocked on the door,

399
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:40,840
and someone answered.

400
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,890
But it wasn't my parents. It was a stranger.

401
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:47,720
Turns out they'd sold the house months ago.

402
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,680
They were gone.

403
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:54,640
I guess they were done with me, too.

404
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,910
To prep Liam for the laparoscopy,

405
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:07,690
we need to make four small incisions in his stomach.

406
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:08,980
I don't need to do it.

407
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,470
I-I don't need to do it.

408
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:12,440
- Liam, you do need to. - I don't need to!

409
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,890
If you could just hold still for a second, Liam.

410
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:16,030
The -- the bus driver lets me off.

411
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,350
I-I get lost --

412
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,230
You're safe now.

413
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,790
I get lost. I'm hungry.

414
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:21,060
I can't make food.

415
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:24,580
C-C-Can't do bath -- Don't need to do it!

416
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:28,010
C-C-Can't do food -- C-Can't put on clothes.

417
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:28,980
Can't do bus.

418
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,510
I took the bus.

419
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,340
I got off at the wrong stop,

420
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,150
and I got scared, but then I found my way.

421
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:44,290
I did an MRI, and a man got hurt.

422
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:48,520
I made a mistake. I make a lot of mistakes.

423
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,070
You tried to walk.

424
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:56,090
You made a mistake.

425
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:59,920
But mistakes are good. You should make more.

426
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,820
You're like me.

427
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:14,430
You have red eyes -- uveitis.

428
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:15,910
Liam takes vitamins --

429
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:18,230
Does Liam also take herbal supplements?

430
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:20,610
Kava root. Why?

431
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:22,520
He doesn't need the laparoscopic surgery.

432
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,030
I know what's wrong with him.

433
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:27,910
The red eyes -- they're caused by an immune flare-up,

434
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:31,680
which can create the scarring that we're seeing in his digestive system.

435
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,470
The solution requires us to go in

436
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:35,900
and remove damaged segments of the bowel piece by piece.

437
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:36,850
Us?

438
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:38,920
Yes, myself and my team.

439
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,920
Is Dr. Murphy on your team?

440
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,910
Of course.

441
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:46,330
Thank you for diagnosing our son.

442
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,260
Dr. Melendez, you have our permission to do the surgery,

443
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,540
but in no way will Dr. Murphy be in it.

444
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:05,620
Well, the parents -- they won't budge.

445
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:07,230
They don't believe that anyone who has autism

446
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:08,600
is capable do doing surgery.

447
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,530
Well, clearly they're irrational --

448
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,860
I don't know -- shallow-minded people.

449
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,550
Who cares? What's the difference?

450
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:15,460
You agree with them, right?

451
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:17,810
Do you agree with them?

452
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:19,490
It's my team -- I don't want anybody telling me

453
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:20,920
who's supposed to be on my team,

454
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,490
including the Board.

455
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:23,120
You're not answering my question.

456
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:23,940
The question's moot.

457
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,890
Moot? No, it's not.

458
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,230
If you agree with them,

459
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:30,300
then the only issue is somebody stepping on your poor, little toes.

460
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,290
Get over it and go save the kid.

461
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:33,460
If you don't agree,

462
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:35,230
if you think Shaun can handle surgery,

463
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:36,010
then tell them that.

464
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:38,500
Tell them to go screw themselves.

465
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:42,540
Either they agree that Dr. Murphy belongs in that room with you,

466
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:46,290
or you can go find them someplace else to do the surgery.

467
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:55,780
I was an 18-year-old with no one and no money.

468
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:59,180
So I worked three jobs and took out loans.

469
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:09,370
Still alive.

470
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:13,780
That's not a bad story, 28.

471
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,350
What happened with the parents?

472
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:20,650
I talk to them now, but...

473
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,660
they're not the people who got me here.

474
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:27,000
It was the people I didn't expect --

475
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,810
the ex-Marine at the shelter who got me my first job,

476
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,540
and this crazy artist girl

477
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:34,920
who convinced me to go after what I really wanted.

478
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:39,040
When you think you're alone, Glen,

479
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:41,140
you're not.

480
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,650
All right.

481
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:56,310
All right?

482
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:03,510
Ready?

483
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:04,820
Two, three!

484
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:08,160
No disturbing dreams?

485
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,690
After a 36-hour shift?

486
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,480
From the moment my head hits the pillow

487
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,980
to the moment wake up,

488
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,740
all I see is black.

489
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,680
How's your level of concentration?

490
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,790
Have you had any difficulty focusing?

491
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:24,640
I mean, I can do the New York Times crossword puzzle in one sitting.

492
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:30,920
Sure, sometimes I wish I was more focused.

493
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:32,880
It's pretty normal, right?

494
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,690
Shaun's different.

495
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:40,840
He also has savant syndrome.

496
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,500
He has a remarkable memory.

497
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:45,890
He has autism, same as our son --

498
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:47,260
same limitations.

499
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:49,380
You saw what happened to our son in the MRI --

500
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:51,950
he knew he needed to lie still, but he couldn't.

501
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:55,240
Now, what happens if Dr. Murphy breaks down like that

502
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,600
while he's standing over my son at an operating table?

503
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,100
You know your son.

504
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,610
I know surgeons.

505
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:04,850
And after working with Dr. Murphy,

506
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:08,370
after challenging him in surgery and everywhere else --

507
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:11,020
probably more than he deserved --

508
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:15,000
I can tell you he has my compete confidence.

509
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:23,330
I'm sorry.

510
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:25,440
He doesn't have ours.

511
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:29,530
So, what do we do now?

512
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:32,580
I've contacted my colleague at St. Joseph's,

513
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:34,000
updated her on Liam's condition.

514
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,600
They have good people.

515
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:39,350
We can arrange for transportation as soon as possible.

516
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:41,750
Where's my phone? Have you seen my phone?

517
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:44,930
Where's his second bag, the one with his medications?

518
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,190
I want...

519
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,970
I want...

520
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:51,940
What, honey?

521
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,410
He said I could do it.

522
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:59,060
I want Dr. Shaun.

523
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,350
Your pacemaker's here.

524
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:08,390
The techs are programming it as we speak.

525
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:10,260
The moment they're ready, we're gonna put it in.

526
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:26,160
I told you my wife died.

527
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:31,020
The truth is s-she left me.

528
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:35,640
But I gave her good reason for that,

529
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:37,880
so I got what I deserved.

530
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:43,520
- We all make -- But you didn't get what you deserved --

531
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:47,000
good parents who loved you.

532
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:52,570
They were lucky to have you, Jared.

533
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,250
You appear remarkably well-adjusted.

534
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,040
Thank you.

535
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,440
That's not a compliment.

536
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,910
That's my concern.

537
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:18,180
Well, I assume everyone responds differently.

538
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:21,340
The thing is everyone responds.

539
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:23,830
Strictly speaking,

540
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:26,700
you don't meet the criteria to be required to go into treatment

541
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,130
or take a leave of absence,

542
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:30,670
so I'm not gonna ground you.

543
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:37,120
You're a strong woman, Claire,

544
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:40,030
and that strength has undoubtedly played a major role

545
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:41,620
in getting you where you are.

546
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:46,340
But if you have suppressed feelings about this incident,

547
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:49,320
you need to find someone to share them with.

548
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:52,350
Because if not, they will eat you up

549
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:54,210
no matter how strong you are.

550
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,490
All right, Glen. Second ti--

551
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,650
Come on.

552
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:12,800
Thank you.

553
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:16,950
It should be a very interesting surgery.

554
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:18,890
I'm glad I'm participating.

555
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:23,450
His pressure is bottoming out.

556
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:24,090
What's happening?

557
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,710
His bowel must have perforated.

558
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:27,720
He's going into septic shock.

559
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,200
This perforation could be anywhere.

560
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,330
What's the best way to access the entire bowel as quickly as possible?

561
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:37,820
Full-length midline incision.

562
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:39,000
Good. Mark it.

563
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,550
And what do we do once we get in there?

564
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:42,040
Eviscerate the entire bowel

565
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,740
so we can check every inch for necrotic segments.

566
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:46,550
Okay, let's make the cut.

567
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:53,570
You gonna take it or not?

568
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,880
This is the Number 3 L.

569
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,950
It's made of high carbon steel. It doesn't break.

570
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,640
That's correct, Dr. Murphy.

571
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:39,420
Time of incision -- 2:05 p.m.

572
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:40,970
We have a code green --

573
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:44,360
patient is a Caucasian male, 73 years of age.

574
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,340
Where'd he go?

575
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,190
Yeah, on my way.

576
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:55,130
I have a five-centimeter segment of proximal jejunum.

577
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,820
It's...sclerotic, but not perforated.

578
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,320
All right, mark it and move on.

579
00:32:58,970 --> 00:32:59,950
Shaun, why are you just standing there?

580
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:02,030
We have 25 feet of bowel to run.

581
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:07,110
Shaun, you need to get moving -- unless you've found something.

582
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:10,210
- I have the perforation. - Clamp it off --

583
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:13,250
I'll get in there with the enterotomy scissors and remove the damaged segment.

584
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,190
I can't.

585
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:19,220
You can't? Why not?

586
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:20,690
It's a phlegmon.

587
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:22,940
You found a walled-off abscess?

588
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,050
It's large.

589
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:25,740
- Don't touch it. - I already am.

590
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,420
If you move and that thing ruptures,

591
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,470
the pus will spread to his entire abdominal cavity --

592
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:30,320
this boy dies.

593
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,140
I know, that's why I'm not moving.

594
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,910
Claire, I need you to open it up gently.

595
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:35,690
I'm gonna evacuate the septic contents,

596
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:37,350
flush the cavity with antibiotics,

597
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:39,080
and then I'm gonna have you remove the capsule.

598
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:41,200
I didn't do anything.

599
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,280
That's the pressure tanking.

600
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:45,020
You need to finish what you're doing right now.

601
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,480
Let's go, Claire. Come on.

602
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:53,810
Clamp.

603
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,950
You guys check left.

604
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,120
Come on.

605
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,090
Stop.

606
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:11,680
Come on, Glen.

607
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:13,240
We can do this.

608
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,470
I don't want to --

609
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:16,200
I just don't want to.

610
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:19,260
Please leave me alone.

611
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:23,380
Once I get my strength back, I'll climb up and jump.

612
00:34:25,910 --> 00:34:27,270
I can't let you do that.

613
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,620
When this temporary pacer fails,

614
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:41,820
which it will,

615
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:45,890
your heart may stop and you die suddenly.

616
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:47,870
But more likely, Glen,

617
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:49,870
you slip back into that slow rhythm,

618
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,220
your chest is racked with excruciating pain

619
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,640
and your lungs start to fill with fluid,

620
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:55,430
and slowly you suffocate.

621
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:57,620
Give it a rest, 28.

622
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:00,700
Just get me a DNR and a cab.

623
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:02,550
You can't help me.

624
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:13,190
Yes, I can.

625
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:28,590
It was a difficult procedure.

626
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:30,710
We removed a total of two feet of --

627
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:31,840
Is he okay?

628
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,430
He will be okay.

629
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,020
Thank you.

630
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:41,730
Thank you, thank you.

631
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:48,140
I-I'm sorry. We're -- We just...

632
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:52,820
He's our son.

633
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,990
You shouldn't feel bad.

634
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:57,470
You did what you thought was best for Liam.

635
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:58,960
You love Liam.

636
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:02,220
I didn't have that from my parents.

637
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:06,590
It also means I didn't have to take kava root,

638
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:09,860
so I didn't get hypereosinophilic gastroenteritis.

639
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:28,190
Are you gonna get in trouble for this?

640
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,730
You're worried about me now?

641
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:35,000
You signed the DNR.

642
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,500
All I'm doing is sitting with you.

643
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:58,040
BGM: Kennedy by Donovan Woods

644
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:54,120
* When they say your father's name *

645
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:56,670
* They're talkin' 'bout a boat *

646
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,290
* They're not talkin' 'bout him *

647
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:04,200
* 'Cause they can't trust you as far *

648
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,830
Are you feeling any anxiety?

649
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:07,610
No.

650
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:09,660
Pain?

651
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:11,620
Some.

652
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,630
Would you like a dose of morphine to help with that?

653
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:22,060
* But back then the ship seemed sunk *

654
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:25,410
* I couldn't sleep when I wasn't drunk *

655
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:28,990
* I couldn't sleep when I wasn't drunk *

656
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:36,460
* But now a bad idea *

657
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,700
* Has cut you in two *

658
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:45,370
* Darlin', I just don't know *

659
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:45,620
Thank you.

660
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:50,790
* Darlin', I just don't know *

661
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:55,480
* Some things you just let go *

662
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:02,030
* Some things you just let go *

663
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:16,240
BGM: Shine a Light by Banners

664
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:17,720
Find your guy?

665
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,690
I did.

666
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:23,570
Put in the biventricular?

667
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:29,180
* Light will lead the way to set you free *

668
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:29,920
How long did it take to get access to the coronary sinus?

669
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:36,240
* I'm only looking for a little peace *

670
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,630
I didn't do the surgery.

671
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,190
I didn't put the pacer in. He, um...

672
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,480
he didn't want it.

673
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:49,900
He was a good guy.

674
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:54,100
* And when the night falls *

675
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:57,210
* Oh, call on me *

676
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:05,920
* Just don't forget to show me some mercy *

677
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:01,840
I lost a patient, too.

678
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,800
Want to talk about it?

679
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:13,520
* Say you're mine *

680
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,180
I do.

681
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:21,360
* Take me higher *

682
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:46,590
Your surgery went well.

683
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:49,840
You should be able to get up and move around in two weeks

684
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,950
once we're sure the antibiotics have cleared your infection.

685
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:53,960
Hear that?

686
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:57,060
It won't be too long until we can go home.

687
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,950
You did great, honey.

688
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:04,890
The lights.

689
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,530
* Shine a light *

690
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:11,530
Are the lights okay?

691
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:14,520
* Shine a light on me *

692
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,260
Do you want them dimmed?

693
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:22,490
* Shine a light on, shine a light on me *

694
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:22,890
They're...okay.

695
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:25,370
* 'Cause I was lost at sea *

696
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:30,300
* While the waves were dragging me underneath *

697
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:37,380
* Shine a light on, shine a light on me *

698
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:42,880
You'll love the software.

699
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:45,680
It makes it very easy to budget.

700
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:48,440
And the best part, it links directly to the bank,

701
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,380
and -- get rid of the ball!

702
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:53,340
He was the first quarterback picked in 2013,

703
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:57,410
but his stats outside the pocket are only 27% competed passes.

704
00:40:57,410 --> 00:41:00,950
Their backup QB is at 65% under pressure.

705
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:02,270
Absolutely.

706
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:05,150
- He's wasted potential on the bench. - Yes.

707
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:09,280
Anyway, the link to the bank will help make automatic --

708
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:11,320
Did you see that?

709
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:14,030
He pinned it against his helmet -- even with the PI!

710
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:15,540
I want to go to the Super Bowl.

711
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:17,370
Okay, see, that's exactly the kind of thing

712
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:19,580
you have to think about before you buy.

713
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:21,540
Tickets are very expensive.

714
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,440
You know -- You know what? You should go.

715
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,000
I should go. We should go.

716
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:30,680
Okay.

717
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:31,800
Excuse me.

718
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,920
It's almost closing time, so...

719
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,000
I'd like to buy this TV.

720
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:42,050
Stay as long as you like.
