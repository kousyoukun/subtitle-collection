2
00:00:24,265 --> 00:00:26,565
Come on. Is the system down?

3
00:00:26,567 --> 00:00:27,933
Worked fine for me.

4
00:00:27,935 --> 00:00:30,102
I don't have time for this.

5
00:00:30,104 --> 00:00:31,489
How you doing?

6
00:00:31,491 --> 00:00:32,905
The computer is not working.

7
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:35,040
That's not what I'm talking about.

8
00:00:35,042 --> 00:00:36,975
I know. I'm fine.

9
00:00:36,977 --> 00:00:39,104
A patient died
because of something you did.

10
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:42,651
I think it's safe to say the
one thing you are not is "fine."

11
00:00:43,617 --> 00:00:44,783
I'm dealing.

12
00:00:44,785 --> 00:00:47,086
How exactly are you dealing?

13
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:48,921
I'm getting back to work,

14
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:51,490
I have a diabetic toe to debride,

15
00:00:51,492 --> 00:00:54,293
and I'm putting it behind me.

16
00:00:54,295 --> 00:00:56,623
How do you do that... put it behind you?

17
00:00:58,185 --> 00:01:00,318
By moving forward.

18
00:01:00,434 --> 00:01:02,601
- I appreciate your concern.
- You're welcome.

19
00:01:02,603 --> 00:01:05,481
I'm gonna make an appointment
for you for grief counseling.

20
00:01:05,483 --> 00:01:09,441
Dr. Mohan... She's an expert
in dealing with hospital staff

21
00:01:09,443 --> 00:01:12,264
who have experienced stressful events.

22
00:01:13,614 --> 00:01:15,173
That's not necessary.

23
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:17,811
You agree you had a "stressful event"?

24
00:01:19,053 --> 00:01:22,721
And while I am comforted by your
commitment to move forward

25
00:01:22,723 --> 00:01:24,274
by not looking back,

26
00:01:24,276 --> 00:01:26,306
I still want you to see Dr. Mohan.

27
00:01:26,306 --> 00:01:28,573
If she says that you are fine,

28
00:01:28,575 --> 00:01:30,942
then... and only then...
can you go back to surgery.

29
00:01:30,944 --> 00:01:32,878
It's working now.

30
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,247
You just have to be patient.

31
00:01:40,988 --> 00:01:42,521
Heart rate 36.

32
00:01:42,523 --> 00:01:44,856
Push another five milligrams of
morphine and prep a nitro drip.

33
00:01:44,858 --> 00:01:46,625
We need atropine on board stat.

34
00:01:46,627 --> 00:01:47,827
What do you got for me?

35
00:01:47,852 --> 00:01:49,394
An MI with severe bradycardia.

36
00:01:49,396 --> 00:01:50,762
He's had aspirin, nitro,

37
00:01:50,764 --> 00:01:53,311
and now we're trying to give him
a real rate with atropine.

38
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:54,431
Cardiology see him?

39
00:01:54,433 --> 00:01:55,400
He's got a broken pacemaker

40
00:01:55,402 --> 00:01:57,702
and probably needs his coronary
arteries cleared...

41
00:01:57,704 --> 00:02:00,433
feels like a triple bypass,
but you're the expert.

42
00:02:00,435 --> 00:02:02,874
BNP is sky high.

43
00:02:02,876 --> 00:02:04,342
What do you see?

44
00:02:04,344 --> 00:02:07,145
His ventricles are barely pumping.

45
00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:10,098
He's had two massive prior MIs.

46
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,416
End stage heart failure.

47
00:02:11,418 --> 00:02:13,085
His heart's way beyond repair.

48
00:02:13,087 --> 00:02:14,252
What are our options?

49
00:02:14,254 --> 00:02:15,554
He's 73 years old.

50
00:02:15,556 --> 00:02:18,223
His age is an absolute
contraindication for transplant.

51
00:02:18,225 --> 00:02:20,559
- He's dying.
- Well, he's not dead yet.

52
00:02:20,561 --> 00:02:21,760
What else?

53
00:02:21,762 --> 00:02:23,849
How about cardiac resynchronization?

54
00:02:23,851 --> 00:02:25,464
That will get what's left of
both ventricles

55
00:02:25,466 --> 00:02:26,298
working together.

56
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,365
A biventricular pacer?

57
00:02:27,367 --> 00:02:28,834
It should make him feel a little better

58
00:02:28,836 --> 00:02:30,936
in the few months he's got left.

59
00:02:32,306 --> 00:02:34,339
His rate drops any lower, he'll arrest.

60
00:02:34,341 --> 00:02:36,942
Claire, prep his jugular to
float in a temporary pacemaker.

61
00:02:36,944 --> 00:02:38,276
Shaun, call up to the cath lab

62
00:02:38,278 --> 00:02:40,045
and have them get an estimate
on how long it'll take

63
00:02:40,047 --> 00:02:41,279
to get the bi-pacer in house.

64
00:02:48,822 --> 00:02:50,021
Something wrong?

65
00:02:50,023 --> 00:02:51,189
Um, not at all.

66
00:02:51,191 --> 00:02:53,024
Just a little bit too much
coffee this morning.

67
00:02:53,026 --> 00:02:54,726
Let's go. Do it now.

68
00:03:05,539 --> 00:03:06,671
Restraints, please!

69
00:03:06,673 --> 00:03:08,340
I don't want to get stuck with a needle.

70
00:03:14,481 --> 00:03:16,414
You're scaring him.

71
00:03:22,823 --> 00:03:24,122
You're scaring him.

72
00:03:24,124 --> 00:03:26,258
Haldol, five milligrams.

73
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,792
You're scaring him!

74
00:03:27,794 --> 00:03:29,628
- Who are you?
- Dr. Shaun Murphy.

75
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,830
This patient is psychotic, Dr. Murphy.

76
00:03:31,832 --> 00:03:33,598
He's not psychotic.

77
00:03:35,601 --> 00:03:38,036
You don't like people touching you.

78
00:03:41,246 --> 00:03:43,542
He's not psychotic. He's autistic.

79
00:03:45,265 --> 00:03:53,389
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

80
00:04:00,826 --> 00:04:02,894
You're being an excellent patient.

81
00:04:05,464 --> 00:04:07,832
Okay. We're finished.

82
00:04:07,834 --> 00:04:11,136
You're s-same as...

83
00:04:11,138 --> 00:04:12,861
me.

84
00:04:13,674 --> 00:04:15,947
Can we release his hands?

85
00:04:17,032 --> 00:04:19,242
Dr. Murphy? His hands?

86
00:04:20,247 --> 00:04:23,315
I'm here, son... Mom and Dad are here.

87
00:04:23,317 --> 00:04:25,417
You can let go of his hands.
He won't hurt you.

88
00:04:29,689 --> 00:04:32,791
Wrong stop. Wrong stop.

89
00:04:32,793 --> 00:04:34,392
Can someone tell me what happened?

90
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:38,797
Liam has a 5.4 centimeter
laceration on his forehead,

91
00:04:38,799 --> 00:04:40,665
probably from a fall.

92
00:04:40,667 --> 00:04:42,434
The wound was infiltrated

93
00:04:42,436 --> 00:04:45,303
with five milliliters of 1% lidocaine...

94
00:04:45,811 --> 00:04:50,976
7... 7 single-interrupted
5-0 Prolene sutures.

95
00:04:50,978 --> 00:04:52,177
He will a small scar,

96
00:04:52,179 --> 00:04:54,346
but no other long-term effects
from this injury.

97
00:04:54,348 --> 00:04:56,047
You're my son's doctor.

98
00:04:56,049 --> 00:05:00,049
I am. Dr. Shaun Murphy...
"Shaun" with a U.

99
00:05:00,051 --> 00:05:02,854
Got lost... got lost, got lost,
got lost, got lost!

100
00:05:02,856 --> 00:05:05,257
- Yes, yes. Yes. But you're okay.
- Got lost. Got lost, got lost.

101
00:05:07,093 --> 00:05:08,760
You won't be taking that bus again.

102
00:05:08,762 --> 00:05:10,262
This light is too bright.

103
00:05:10,264 --> 00:05:12,597
These rooms make him anxious.
Can we take him home?

104
00:05:12,599 --> 00:05:13,898
No.

105
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,710
Your son is jaundiced,

106
00:05:15,712 --> 00:05:17,702
clenching his right abdominal
muscles when touched

107
00:05:17,704 --> 00:05:18,536
and febrile.

108
00:05:18,538 --> 00:05:19,838
He should not go home.

109
00:05:30,816 --> 00:05:32,651
Why am I here?

110
00:05:32,653 --> 00:05:35,020
Your pacemaker malfunctioned.

111
00:05:35,022 --> 00:05:36,421
You had a heart attack.

112
00:05:36,423 --> 00:05:39,291
I... I think I get that part.

113
00:05:40,427 --> 00:05:42,238
Your neighbor's gardener

114
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,262
saw you on the ground
inside your house...

115
00:05:44,264 --> 00:05:46,898
called 911, saved your life.

116
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:50,802
Well, I must remember to thank him.

117
00:05:52,838 --> 00:05:55,005
How old are you?

118
00:05:56,043 --> 00:05:57,142
Me?

119
00:05:57,144 --> 00:05:59,778
I know how old <i>I</i> am.

120
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,678
I'm 28.

121
00:06:02,082 --> 00:06:04,849
We have, uh, a biventricular
pacer on its way,

122
00:06:04,851 --> 00:06:06,975
and it's gonna make you feel
a lot better.

123
00:06:07,694 --> 00:06:09,527
Is it?

124
00:06:11,524 --> 00:06:13,892
I will be back to prep you for surgery.

125
00:06:15,761 --> 00:06:18,563
Liam has elevated bilirubin
and liver enzymes,

126
00:06:18,565 --> 00:06:20,398
a white cell count of 23.

127
00:06:21,306 --> 00:06:24,903
Abdominal ultrasound shows
dilatation of the bile ducts.

128
00:06:25,744 --> 00:06:27,038
Sounds like ascending cholangitis...

129
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,139
can lead to sepsis

130
00:06:28,141 --> 00:06:30,542
if the bacteria gain access to his blood.

131
00:06:30,544 --> 00:06:31,743
Is he stable now?

132
00:06:31,745 --> 00:06:34,012
Yes, his vital signs are stable.

133
00:06:34,014 --> 00:06:36,815
Cause could be anything
from cancer to diet, so...

134
00:06:36,817 --> 00:06:39,784
Liam's parents have him
on a special ketogenic diet.

135
00:06:39,786 --> 00:06:42,120
High-fat diets can cause
obstructive gallstones,

136
00:06:42,122 --> 00:06:43,888
which could have set the whole thing off.

137
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:45,557
Do an ERCP to clear him.

138
00:06:45,559 --> 00:06:47,892
After that, a few weeks
of broad spectrum antibiotics

139
00:06:47,894 --> 00:06:49,094
should take care of things.

140
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:06,030
_

141
00:07:09,223 --> 00:07:11,223
_

142
00:07:11,952 --> 00:07:14,285
I want you help.

143
00:07:14,287 --> 00:07:16,586
With what?

144
00:07:17,357 --> 00:07:19,991
Endoscopic Retrograde
Cholangio-Pancreatography.

145
00:07:19,993 --> 00:07:22,801
ERCP? Why?

146
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,131
You've done those before, Shaun.

147
00:07:26,133 --> 00:07:28,900
You're good with people who have autism.

148
00:07:34,073 --> 00:07:37,774
Okay, Glen, let's get this, star... ted

149
00:07:38,979 --> 00:07:40,612
Glen, you almost finished?

150
00:07:43,349 --> 00:07:45,156
It's Dr. Kalu.

151
00:07:46,553 --> 00:07:48,052
Glen?

152
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:00,965
Yeah, we have a code green.

153
00:08:00,967 --> 00:08:04,002
Patient is Caucasian, male, 185 pounds.

154
00:08:14,281 --> 00:08:16,181
Shaun, can you talk to him or something?

155
00:08:16,183 --> 00:08:17,449
I can't push the Midazolam.

156
00:08:21,821 --> 00:08:24,222
Four lights... four doors.

157
00:08:24,224 --> 00:08:25,990
Yes. Lots of things.

158
00:08:25,992 --> 00:08:30,361
32 and 8. 32, 8.

159
00:08:30,363 --> 00:08:33,498
32 is the number of cabinet windows,

160
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,332
and 8 is the number of handles.

161
00:08:38,638 --> 00:08:40,605
Hmm, the end title's CO2 is rising.

162
00:08:40,607 --> 00:08:43,208
He needs oxygen.
He has respiratory depression.

163
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:45,550
It's a common reaction to Midazolam.

164
00:08:51,116 --> 00:08:53,318
CO2 is coming down.

165
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,685
- You can proceed, Claire.
- Thank you.

166
00:09:03,729 --> 00:09:07,030
Have you been around
a lot of other autistic people?

167
00:09:07,701 --> 00:09:09,801
I've never met someone with autism.

168
00:09:09,803 --> 00:09:11,069
Oh.

169
00:09:11,071 --> 00:09:13,438
So, it must be nice to spend
some time around Liam, then.

170
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,039
Why?

171
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:16,873
Why would that be nice?

172
00:09:18,612 --> 00:09:20,335
Okay.

173
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:24,422
There are no stones.

174
00:09:24,851 --> 00:09:27,185
Where are the stones?

175
00:09:27,187 --> 00:09:29,120
And there is scarring.

176
00:09:29,122 --> 00:09:31,756
This has nothing to do with gallstones.

177
00:09:31,758 --> 00:09:34,158
The entire biliary tree is so
thick with scarring

178
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,461
we can't even get the camera through.

179
00:09:40,425 --> 00:09:43,901
The differential diagnosis for
biliary tree scarring includes

180
00:09:44,633 --> 00:09:48,278
primary sclerosing cholangitis,
liver failure,

181
00:09:48,305 --> 00:09:50,439
secondary to primary biliary cirrhosis...

182
00:09:50,441 --> 00:09:53,208
Yeah, Shaun, we can add a few
cancers to that list as well...

183
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:54,743
It's a long and ugly one.

184
00:09:54,745 --> 00:09:57,179
Find another way
to figure out what it is.

185
00:09:57,181 --> 00:09:58,347
We could do an MRI.

186
00:09:58,349 --> 00:09:59,999
No, we couldn't.

187
00:10:01,952 --> 00:10:03,152
It's not possible.

188
00:10:03,154 --> 00:10:04,653
That's the first time
I've ever heard you say that.

189
00:10:04,655 --> 00:10:06,321
- Liam is stimming.
- Stimming?

190
00:10:06,323 --> 00:10:09,491
The tics and spasms are a
neurological response to stress.

191
00:10:09,493 --> 00:10:11,226
If he's doing an MRI, there is stress...

192
00:10:11,228 --> 00:10:12,961
if there is stress, he won't keep still,

193
00:10:12,963 --> 00:10:14,830
if he wont' keep still,
we can't do an MRI.

194
00:10:14,832 --> 00:10:16,131
Therefore, it is impossible.

195
00:10:16,133 --> 00:10:17,966
Maybe if you just keep talking
to him like that,

196
00:10:17,968 --> 00:10:19,936
he'll doze off and it'll all be simple.

197
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:22,437
Give him a mild sedative.

198
00:10:22,439 --> 00:10:24,740
He didn't respond well
to Midazolam during ERCP...

199
00:10:24,742 --> 00:10:26,141
depresses his breathing.

200
00:10:26,143 --> 00:10:28,765
His respiratory saturation can't
be properly monitored inside...

201
00:10:28,767 --> 00:10:29,978
I get it.

202
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,914
He could die in the MRI
and we wouldn't know.

203
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:33,749
You're just gonna have to find
a different way to calm him.

204
00:10:33,751 --> 00:10:35,368
Okay. We'll do it.

205
00:10:35,786 --> 00:10:37,052
Guess he has an idea.

206
00:10:39,557 --> 00:10:41,023
<i>We have a code green.</i>

207
00:10:41,025 --> 00:10:44,092
<i>Patient is a Caucasian male,
73 years of age.</i>

208
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,548
Shaun, what are you doing?

209
00:10:48,999 --> 00:10:50,632
Counting.

210
00:10:50,634 --> 00:10:52,568
- Counting what?
- Hmm. Distance.

211
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:54,703
Why?

212
00:10:54,705 --> 00:10:58,240
I want $1,643.

213
00:10:58,242 --> 00:11:00,042
You can get that by counting?

214
00:11:00,044 --> 00:11:03,605
That's why you're alone
and pacing in this room?

215
00:11:04,348 --> 00:11:05,614
What do you want the money for?

216
00:11:05,616 --> 00:11:08,851
- I want to buy a television.
- $1,600 for a television?

217
00:11:08,853 --> 00:11:11,453
And 43. I am a surgeon. I get paychecks.

218
00:11:11,455 --> 00:11:13,889
You're not a surgeon yet.
You're a surgical resident.

219
00:11:13,891 --> 00:11:16,558
Ah, there's a big difference
in the paycheck there, pal.

220
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,727
I'm not a child, pal.

221
00:11:20,431 --> 00:11:22,631
How 'bout $1,000 for a television?

222
00:11:22,633 --> 00:11:25,567
No. The one I want is $1,643, okay?

223
00:11:25,569 --> 00:11:27,402
I know, but you have a budget.

224
00:11:27,404 --> 00:11:30,706
- A budget.
- You... Uh, rent, food, bills to pay.

225
00:11:32,809 --> 00:11:35,911
I should do my own budget.
I have an MRI to do.

226
00:11:42,219 --> 00:11:45,754
These are live feeds...
entrances, E.R., receiving dock.

227
00:11:45,756 --> 00:11:47,356
If your patient had left,
we would've seen it.

228
00:11:47,358 --> 00:11:48,657
Then where'd he go?

229
00:11:48,659 --> 00:11:51,093
A freight elevator, but we don't
have cams in the freights,

230
00:11:51,095 --> 00:11:52,261
and he doesn't pop back up.

231
00:11:52,263 --> 00:11:56,098
So, we're dealing with
an alien abduction here?

232
00:11:58,334 --> 00:11:59,835
Sorry.

233
00:11:59,837 --> 00:12:01,703
We don't have cams
on the freight elevators

234
00:12:01,705 --> 00:12:03,739
on levels one, four
and five, and the basement.

235
00:12:03,741 --> 00:12:05,307
And you got people
looking on those floors?

236
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:07,276
We've covered four and five,
and we're moving on to one.

237
00:12:18,064 --> 00:12:21,670
_

238
00:12:28,698 --> 00:12:31,800
_

239
00:12:33,604 --> 00:12:35,938
Hey.

240
00:12:37,607 --> 00:12:38,674
What's in the basement?

241
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:41,410
Pediatric patient lost a blanket...

242
00:12:41,412 --> 00:12:43,045
I'm just gonna check lost and found.

243
00:12:43,621 --> 00:12:45,147
That's nice of you.

244
00:12:47,617 --> 00:12:48,850
While you're there,

245
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:52,621
you might want to check
if they found your code green.

246
00:13:05,234 --> 00:13:08,537
<i>Uh, this is Doctor...</i>

247
00:13:08,896 --> 00:13:10,339
<i>This is Shaun.</i>

248
00:13:10,341 --> 00:13:12,641
I an hear you when you speak.

249
00:13:12,643 --> 00:13:14,944
<i>I was thinking about something.</i>

250
00:13:15,512 --> 00:13:20,148
<i>There are 24 steps
from the ambulance to the E.R.</i>

251
00:13:22,685 --> 00:13:25,620
Please turn down the lights.
That helps calm him.

252
00:13:27,915 --> 00:13:31,460
There are 24 steps
from the ambulance to the E.R.

253
00:13:33,755 --> 00:13:38,926
There are 22 steps from
the ambulance to the E.R.

254
00:13:39,703 --> 00:13:41,970
He has very long strides.

255
00:13:42,712 --> 00:13:44,045
Yes.

256
00:13:44,182 --> 00:13:47,843
There are <i>22</i> steps
from the ambulance to the E.R.

257
00:13:54,318 --> 00:13:59,454
There are 37 steps
from the elevator to room 405.

258
00:13:59,456 --> 00:14:02,557
There are 37 steps

259
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:06,895
from the elevator to room 405.

260
00:14:06,897 --> 00:14:11,700
In room 405,
there are 6 steps to the sink...

261
00:14:11,702 --> 00:14:13,902
6 steps to the sink.

262
00:14:14,378 --> 00:14:16,405
We're getting good images.

263
00:14:16,407 --> 00:14:21,052
It's amazing how accomplished
you are for someone with ASD.

264
00:14:21,812 --> 00:14:23,879
Three steps to the window.

265
00:14:23,881 --> 00:14:24,846
Three steps to...

266
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:27,449
<i>Three...</i>

267
00:14:29,753 --> 00:14:33,755
<i>It's seven steps...
It's seven steps to the door.</i>

268
00:14:33,757 --> 00:14:36,818
Liam, there are seven steps to the door.

269
00:14:38,594 --> 00:14:39,661
You need to get him out.

270
00:14:39,663 --> 00:14:40,784
Just a little more time.

271
00:14:40,786 --> 00:14:42,260
- He's scared.
- It's okay to be scared.

272
00:14:42,285 --> 00:14:43,198
We need to finish this.

273
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,434
Seven... You're doing wonderfully, honey.

274
00:14:45,436 --> 00:14:49,304
<i>Just breathe. Just breathe.</i>

275
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:52,441
No, it's seven steps to the door.

276
00:15:17,266 --> 00:15:18,967
Glen?

277
00:15:24,807 --> 00:15:26,475
Glen?

278
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,582
Glen?

279
00:15:38,221 --> 00:15:39,721
Glen?

280
00:15:39,723 --> 00:15:42,524
It's Dr. Kalu.

281
00:15:42,526 --> 00:15:44,192
Let's get you upstairs.

282
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:45,160
Go away.

283
00:15:45,162 --> 00:15:47,329
We're gonna get your new pacer in.

284
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:49,682
Don't you get it?

285
00:15:50,734 --> 00:15:53,060
I broke my pacer on purpose.

286
00:15:54,438 --> 00:15:56,771
I <i>want</i> to die.

287
00:16:05,187 --> 00:16:07,388
With a new pacemaker,
maybe you'll feel better.

288
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:09,490
So, I'll be cured?

289
00:16:09,492 --> 00:16:10,925
Good as new?

290
00:16:10,927 --> 00:16:12,360
Heh.

291
00:16:12,362 --> 00:16:14,162
Well, it'll reduce your pain,
and then hopefully...

292
00:16:14,164 --> 00:16:16,431
You think this is
the first time I've heard that?

293
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,766
It's always the "next best thing."

294
00:16:21,337 --> 00:16:25,573
The truth is
I'll just keep getting worse.

295
00:16:25,575 --> 00:16:27,642
I know it, you know it.

296
00:16:27,644 --> 00:16:29,343
Do you have any family you can talk to?

297
00:16:29,345 --> 00:16:32,613
Brother's dead. I don't have a wife.

298
00:16:32,615 --> 00:16:37,318
So, no, there's no one around to
nag me into doing what you want.

299
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,687
We have great counseling services here.

300
00:16:39,689 --> 00:16:42,757
I'm in pain, 28...

301
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:43,891
all the time.

302
00:16:43,893 --> 00:16:46,627
Talk therapy gonna talk that away?

303
00:16:46,629 --> 00:16:47,829
Let's get you upstairs.

304
00:16:47,831 --> 00:16:49,597
You color's not good,
and your lungs are crackling,

305
00:16:49,599 --> 00:16:51,065
which means there's fluid building in...

306
00:16:51,067 --> 00:16:52,203
I know my...

307
00:16:52,769 --> 00:16:54,068
I know my rights.

308
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:56,457
I don't have to get treatment
if I don't want it.

309
00:16:57,273 --> 00:16:59,874
The minute I catch my breath,
I'm gonna walk out of here,

310
00:17:00,336 --> 00:17:03,711
so you can just leave.

311
00:17:11,154 --> 00:17:12,954
I'm not leaving.

312
00:17:25,367 --> 00:17:27,568
We can't treat it until
we find the underlying cause.

313
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:28,903
How do you do that?

314
00:17:28,905 --> 00:17:32,140
Surgically... It's called
"exploratory laparoscopy."

315
00:17:32,142 --> 00:17:35,610
We use a camera to navigate
Liam's midsection.

316
00:17:35,612 --> 00:17:38,040
There are significant risks...

317
00:17:38,581 --> 00:17:40,281
perforation of an organ,

318
00:17:40,283 --> 00:17:42,950
accidental spread seeding malignancy.

319
00:17:42,952 --> 00:17:44,252
And you have to do this

320
00:17:44,254 --> 00:17:46,621
because he can't stay still
during an MRI?

321
00:17:46,623 --> 00:17:48,689
You obviously know your son
better than I do.

322
00:17:48,691 --> 00:17:50,158
Do you think we should try again?

323
00:18:11,014 --> 00:18:13,281
So, Shaun told me he's getting a TV...

324
00:18:13,283 --> 00:18:15,283
70 inches, all the works.

325
00:18:15,285 --> 00:18:16,651
Is he now?

326
00:18:16,653 --> 00:18:17,952
It's just a TV.

327
00:18:17,954 --> 00:18:19,387
It's not about a TV.

328
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:21,155
Why are you so worried about him?

329
00:18:21,157 --> 00:18:23,324
He showed up late for work
half a dozen times,

330
00:18:23,326 --> 00:18:24,892
he calls me 2:00 in the morning

331
00:18:24,894 --> 00:18:26,627
'cause he can't find a screwdriver,

332
00:18:26,629 --> 00:18:29,315
and his superintendent wants to
kick him out of his building.

333
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:31,165
- Did you show up?
- What?

334
00:18:31,167 --> 00:18:32,533
At 2:00 in the morning when he called you

335
00:18:32,535 --> 00:18:34,669
about a lost screwdriver,

336
00:18:34,671 --> 00:18:36,026
did you show up?

337
00:18:36,028 --> 00:18:37,171
He was frantic.

338
00:18:37,173 --> 00:18:38,559
I didn't know what he was gonna do.

339
00:18:38,561 --> 00:18:40,641
There are 47 residents here,

340
00:18:40,643 --> 00:18:42,310
and all of them show up late sometimes,

341
00:18:42,312 --> 00:18:43,377
all of them make mistakes,

342
00:18:43,379 --> 00:18:45,413
and hopefully, all of them learn.

343
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:47,982
If you want to worry about Shaun, fine.

344
00:18:47,984 --> 00:18:51,886
But you fought to hire him
because you know he can learn.

345
00:18:52,615 --> 00:18:55,723
The question is,
are you willing to let him?

346
00:19:05,735 --> 00:19:06,767
Shaun?

347
00:19:06,769 --> 00:19:08,964
I can see the pixelation.

348
00:19:09,505 --> 00:19:11,592
- That's great. Listen...
- It's not great.

349
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,342
Mm, it's not good.

350
00:19:14,344 --> 00:19:15,776
On a high-quality display,

351
00:19:15,778 --> 00:19:18,479
the human eye at 20/20
cannot detect the pixels.

352
00:19:20,682 --> 00:19:24,518
You disappeared after the failed MRI.

353
00:19:25,988 --> 00:19:27,622
I failed.

354
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:31,112
Yeah, see, I don't think it's about that.

355
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:34,795
You were hesitant with this kid
even before that.

356
00:19:34,797 --> 00:19:37,284
You asked me to the ERCP.

357
00:19:38,201 --> 00:19:40,935
Doctors don't have to like their
patients, Claire.

358
00:19:42,704 --> 00:19:44,939
- You don't like him?
- I don't know him.

359
00:19:44,941 --> 00:19:47,508
Shaun, there's something else
going on here.

360
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:50,297
- I know you know that.
- No. Nu... Nu-huh.

361
00:19:51,247 --> 00:19:53,447
He has the same condition you have.

362
00:19:53,449 --> 00:19:55,483
You have never met anyone with...

363
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:57,685
Do you like all people with psoriasis?

364
00:19:59,388 --> 00:20:01,122
I don't have...

365
00:20:01,124 --> 00:20:02,690
Yes, you do.

366
00:20:02,692 --> 00:20:05,026
And you can never get rid of it.

367
00:20:05,028 --> 00:20:05,960
Okay.

368
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,362
It's too bad you don't like him,

369
00:20:08,364 --> 00:20:10,798
because I think he likes you.

370
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,034
Not only that,
I think he looks up to you.

371
00:20:13,036 --> 00:20:15,403
So you know how he thinks?

372
00:20:16,198 --> 00:20:18,706
Well, not as much as you probably do.

373
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:26,000
What are you waiting for?

374
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,461
For you to pass out.

375
00:20:30,987 --> 00:20:33,454
Judging by the size your ankles...

376
00:20:35,124 --> 00:20:36,590
...that shouldn't be too long from now.

377
00:20:36,592 --> 00:20:39,727
Then hopefully I can get you
upstairs before you die.

378
00:20:39,729 --> 00:20:43,364
Why do you give such a damn
about what I do with my life?

379
00:20:43,366 --> 00:20:45,060
I don't know, Glen.

380
00:20:46,002 --> 00:20:48,105
Why'd you want to die so bad?

381
00:20:53,508 --> 00:20:54,820
I've lived.

382
00:20:55,912 --> 00:20:57,611
I've had decent jobs,

383
00:20:57,613 --> 00:20:59,880
and I've had jobs that went nowhere.

384
00:21:01,884 --> 00:21:03,818
Had a good roof over my head,

385
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:06,687
and I've had that good roof
taken away from me.

386
00:21:07,249 --> 00:21:10,591
I loved a girl, and I got married.

387
00:21:11,378 --> 00:21:14,256
The 20 happiest years of my life...

388
00:21:15,431 --> 00:21:17,051
then she died.

389
00:21:18,334 --> 00:21:20,471
And now I'm alone

390
00:21:21,304 --> 00:21:23,070
and in pain.

391
00:21:25,007 --> 00:21:28,646
Feels like the end of the story.

392
00:21:32,748 --> 00:21:34,014
I understand.

393
00:21:34,016 --> 00:21:35,069
Yeah?

394
00:21:36,085 --> 00:21:39,198
You've had some tough times, too, 28?

395
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:42,515
Nobody understands what it's like

396
00:21:42,517 --> 00:21:45,788
to be so good-looking and successful?

397
00:21:47,196 --> 00:21:49,497
I was raised by nannies and housekeepers.

398
00:21:49,499 --> 00:21:51,098
Oh, my God.

399
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,433
You're an ass.

400
00:21:52,435 --> 00:21:54,201
Your point is you didn't suffer

401
00:21:54,203 --> 00:21:56,470
because you were good-looking
and smart...

402
00:21:56,472 --> 00:22:00,207
you suffered because you were rich?

403
00:22:02,711 --> 00:22:04,845
The only time I ever saw
my parents was Christmas.

404
00:22:04,847 --> 00:22:07,982
Seriously, the story continues?

405
00:22:07,984 --> 00:22:10,017
They had this big party every year,

406
00:22:10,019 --> 00:22:12,690
and wherever they were traveling
they'd always fly home for it.

407
00:22:13,774 --> 00:22:15,734
And I'd have to come home, too,

408
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:18,946
from whatever school they sent me off to.

409
00:22:20,129 --> 00:22:23,492
When I was 18,
I decided that I was fed up.

410
00:22:24,834 --> 00:22:28,288
I was a man, done being their son.

411
00:22:30,673 --> 00:22:32,584
And I was gonna tell them publicly,

412
00:22:33,476 --> 00:22:36,046
tell all their friends what
horrible people they were.

413
00:22:36,579 --> 00:22:38,646
So I came home from school,
and I knocked on the door,

414
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:40,968
and someone answered.

415
00:22:42,185 --> 00:22:44,680
But it wasn't my parents.
It was a stranger.

416
00:22:45,288 --> 00:22:47,516
Turns out they'd sold the house
months ago.

417
00:22:48,291 --> 00:22:50,057
They were gone.

418
00:22:52,794 --> 00:22:54,962
I guess they were done with me, too.

419
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:04,853
To prep Liam for the laparoscopy,

420
00:23:04,855 --> 00:23:07,441
we need to make four small
incisions in his stomach.

421
00:23:07,443 --> 00:23:09,043
I don't need to do it.

422
00:23:09,045 --> 00:23:10,511
I-I don't need to do it.

423
00:23:10,513 --> 00:23:12,513
- Liam, you do need to.
- I don't need to!

424
00:23:12,515 --> 00:23:14,081
If you could just hold still
for a second, Liam.

425
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:15,883
The... the bus driver lets me off.

426
00:23:15,885 --> 00:23:17,451
I-I get lost...

427
00:23:17,453 --> 00:23:18,285
You're safe now.

428
00:23:18,287 --> 00:23:19,720
I get lost. I'm hungry.

429
00:23:19,722 --> 00:23:20,888
I can't make food.

430
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:24,058
C-C-Can't do bath... Don't need to do it!

431
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:28,028
C-C-Can't do food...
C-Can't put on clothes.

432
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:29,065
Can't do bus.

433
00:23:29,067 --> 00:23:30,865
I took the bus.

434
00:23:33,335 --> 00:23:35,302
I got off at the wrong stop,

435
00:23:35,304 --> 00:23:37,905
and I got scared,
but then I found my way.

436
00:23:40,943 --> 00:23:44,323
I did an MRI, and a man got hurt.

437
00:23:44,947 --> 00:23:48,249
I made a mistake.
I make a lot of mistakes.

438
00:23:52,153 --> 00:23:54,288
You tried to walk.

439
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:56,084
You made a mistake.

440
00:23:56,626 --> 00:23:59,838
But mistakes are good.
You should make more.

441
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:02,796
You're like me.

442
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,475
You have red eyes... uveitis.

443
00:24:14,477 --> 00:24:17,912
Liam takes vitamins... Does Liam
also take herbal supplements?

444
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:20,414
Kava root. Why?

445
00:24:20,416 --> 00:24:22,550
He doesn't need the laparoscopic surgery.

446
00:24:22,552 --> 00:24:24,112
I know what's wrong with him.

447
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:27,888
The red eyes... they're
caused by an immune flare-up,

448
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:30,357
which can create the scarring
that we're seeing

449
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:31,659
in his digestive system.

450
00:24:31,661 --> 00:24:33,260
The solution requires us to go in

451
00:24:33,262 --> 00:24:35,729
and remove damaged segments
of the bowel piece by piece.

452
00:24:35,731 --> 00:24:36,797
Us?

453
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,933
Yes, myself and my team.

454
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:40,534
Is Dr. Murphy on your team?

455
00:24:40,536 --> 00:24:41,880
Of course.

456
00:24:42,672 --> 00:24:46,510
Thank you for diagnosing our son.

457
00:24:47,209 --> 00:24:50,430
Dr. Melendez, you have our
permission to do the surgery,

458
00:24:51,714 --> 00:24:55,115
but in no way will Dr. Murphy be in it.

459
00:25:03,344 --> 00:25:04,829
Well, the parents... they won't budge.

460
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:06,302
They don't believe
that anyone who has autism

461
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,895
is capable do doing surgery.

462
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:09,950
Well, clearly they're irrational...

463
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:11,541
I don't know... shallow-minded people.

464
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:12,876
Who cares? What's the difference?

465
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:14,705
You agree with them, right?

466
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,080
Do you agree with them?

467
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:19,016
It's my team... I don't want
anybody telling me

468
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:21,151
who's supposed to be on my team,
including the Board.

469
00:25:21,153 --> 00:25:22,452
You're not answering my question.

470
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:25,389
- The question's moot.
- Moot? No, it's not.

471
00:25:25,391 --> 00:25:27,252
If you agree with them,
then the only issue

472
00:25:27,252 --> 00:25:29,653
is somebody stepping on
your poor, little toes.

473
00:25:29,655 --> 00:25:31,421
Get over it and go save the kid.

474
00:25:31,423 --> 00:25:32,756
If you don't agree,

475
00:25:32,758 --> 00:25:35,158
if you think Shaun can handle
surgery, then tell them that.

476
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,427
Tell them to go screw themselves.

477
00:25:37,429 --> 00:25:40,030
Either they agree that Dr. Murphy belongs

478
00:25:40,032 --> 00:25:42,866
in that room with you,
or you can go find them

479
00:25:42,868 --> 00:25:45,035
someplace else to do the surgery.

480
00:25:52,277 --> 00:25:54,953
I was an 18-year-old
with no one and no money.

481
00:25:55,829 --> 00:25:58,181
So I worked three jobs
and took out loans.

482
00:26:06,457 --> 00:26:08,591
Still alive.

483
00:26:10,594 --> 00:26:13,138
That's not a bad story, 28.

484
00:26:14,299 --> 00:26:16,725
What happened with the parents?

485
00:26:17,969 --> 00:26:20,020
I talk to them now, but...

486
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:23,673
they're not the people who got me here.

487
00:26:24,399 --> 00:26:26,276
It was the people I didn't expect...

488
00:26:26,278 --> 00:26:29,112
the ex-Marine at the shelter
who got me my first job,

489
00:26:29,114 --> 00:26:31,491
and this crazy artist girl

490
00:26:31,493 --> 00:26:34,250
who convinced me to go after
what I really wanted.

491
00:26:36,487 --> 00:26:40,190
When you think you're alone,
Glen, you're not.

492
00:26:51,703 --> 00:26:53,178
All right.

493
00:26:54,306 --> 00:26:55,847
All right?

494
00:27:01,713 --> 00:27:02,912
Ready?

495
00:27:02,914 --> 00:27:04,013
Two, three!

496
00:27:05,883 --> 00:27:09,652
- No disturbing dreams?
- After a 36-hour shift?

497
00:27:09,654 --> 00:27:11,978
From the moment my head hits the pillow

498
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:14,624
to the moment wake up,
all I see is black.

499
00:27:14,626 --> 00:27:17,660
Hm. How's your level of concentration?

500
00:27:17,662 --> 00:27:19,395
Have you had any difficulty focusing?

501
00:27:19,397 --> 00:27:20,697
I mean, I can do

502
00:27:20,699 --> 00:27:23,533
the <i>New York Times</i> crossword
puzzle in one sitting.

503
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:30,140
Sure, sometimes
I wish I was more focused.

504
00:27:30,142 --> 00:27:32,041
It's pretty normal, right?

505
00:27:36,304 --> 00:27:38,014
Shaun's different.

506
00:27:38,016 --> 00:27:39,816
He also has savant syndrome.

507
00:27:39,818 --> 00:27:41,751
He has a remarkable memory.

508
00:27:41,753 --> 00:27:46,256
He has autism, same as
our son... same limitations.

509
00:27:46,258 --> 00:27:48,358
You saw what happened
to our son in the MRI...

510
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:51,094
he knew he needed to lie still,
but he couldn't.

511
00:27:51,096 --> 00:27:54,336
Now, what happens if Dr. Murphy
breaks down like that

512
00:27:54,338 --> 00:27:57,200
while he's standing over my son
at an operating table?

513
00:27:57,617 --> 00:27:59,119
You know your son.

514
00:28:00,037 --> 00:28:01,496
I know surgeons.

515
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,940
And after working with Dr. Murphy,

516
00:28:03,942 --> 00:28:06,810
after challenging him in surgery
and everywhere else...

517
00:28:08,045 --> 00:28:09,838
probably more than he deserved...

518
00:28:10,964 --> 00:28:14,150
I can tell you
he has my compete confidence.

519
00:28:20,959 --> 00:28:22,759
I'm sorry.

520
00:28:22,761 --> 00:28:24,478
He doesn't have ours.

521
00:28:25,197 --> 00:28:28,231
So, what do we do now?

522
00:28:28,233 --> 00:28:31,134
I've contacted my colleague
at St. Joseph's,

523
00:28:31,526 --> 00:28:33,636
updated her on Liam's condition.

524
00:28:33,638 --> 00:28:35,305
They have good people.

525
00:28:35,307 --> 00:28:36,973
We can arrange for transportation

526
00:28:36,975 --> 00:28:38,141
as soon as possible.

527
00:28:38,909 --> 00:28:40,677
Where's my phone? Have you seen my phone?

528
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:43,479
Where's his second bag,
the one with his medications?

529
00:28:43,872 --> 00:28:45,540
I want...

530
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:48,126
I want...

531
00:28:49,554 --> 00:28:51,354
What, honey?

532
00:28:51,356 --> 00:28:53,673
He said I could do it.

533
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:57,694
I want Dr. Shaun.

534
00:29:04,236 --> 00:29:05,561
Your pacemaker's here.

535
00:29:05,563 --> 00:29:07,103
The techs are programming it as we speak.

536
00:29:07,437 --> 00:29:09,439
The moment they're ready,
we're gonna put it in.

537
00:29:21,386 --> 00:29:26,022
I told you my wife died.

538
00:29:26,024 --> 00:29:30,252
The truth is s-she left me.

539
00:29:32,087 --> 00:29:34,764
But I gave her good reason for that,

540
00:29:34,766 --> 00:29:37,050
so I got what I deserved.

541
00:29:38,803 --> 00:29:42,472
We all make... But you didn't
get what you deserved...

542
00:29:43,241 --> 00:29:46,142
good parents who loved you.

543
00:29:47,746 --> 00:29:51,814
They were lucky to have you, Jared.

544
00:30:06,965 --> 00:30:09,098
You appear remarkably well-adjusted.

545
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,033
Thank you.

546
00:30:10,035 --> 00:30:11,401
That's not a compliment.

547
00:30:11,403 --> 00:30:13,169
That's my concern.

548
00:30:13,872 --> 00:30:16,839
Well, I assume
everyone responds differently.

549
00:30:16,841 --> 00:30:20,677
The thing is everyone <i>responds.</i>

550
00:30:21,579 --> 00:30:23,012
Strictly speaking,

551
00:30:23,014 --> 00:30:25,581
you don't meet the criteria to
be required to go into treatment

552
00:30:25,583 --> 00:30:27,617
or take a leave of absence,

553
00:30:28,143 --> 00:30:29,752
so I'm not gonna ground you.

554
00:30:34,258 --> 00:30:36,092
You're a strong woman, Claire,

555
00:30:36,094 --> 00:30:38,995
and that strength has
undoubtedly played a major role

556
00:30:38,997 --> 00:30:40,822
in getting you where you are.

557
00:30:41,967 --> 00:30:45,735
But if you have suppressed
feelings about this incident,

558
00:30:45,737 --> 00:30:48,404
you need to find someone
to share them with.

559
00:30:48,406 --> 00:30:51,274
Because if not, they will eat you up

560
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,209
no matter how strong you are.

561
00:30:59,383 --> 00:31:01,818
All right, Glen. Second ti...

562
00:31:03,787 --> 00:31:05,855
Oh, come on.

563
00:31:10,628 --> 00:31:12,312
Thank you.

564
00:31:14,099 --> 00:31:16,232
It should be a very interesting surgery.

565
00:31:16,234 --> 00:31:17,600
I'm glad I'm participating.

566
00:31:20,405 --> 00:31:22,071
His pressure is bottoming out.

567
00:31:22,073 --> 00:31:23,296
What's happening?

568
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:24,774
His bowel must have perforated.

569
00:31:24,776 --> 00:31:26,909
He's going into septic shock.

570
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:31,402
This perforation could be anywhere.

571
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,906
What's the best way to access
the entire bowel

572
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:35,044
as quickly as possible?

573
00:31:35,046 --> 00:31:36,434
Full-length midline incision.

574
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:37,501
Good. Mark it.

575
00:31:37,503 --> 00:31:39,270
And what do we do once we get in there?

576
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:40,638
Eviscerate the entire bowel

577
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,307
so we can check every inch
for necrotic segments.

578
00:31:43,309 --> 00:31:45,376
Okay, let's make the cut.

579
00:31:50,717 --> 00:31:52,516
You gonna take it or not?

580
00:32:15,341 --> 00:32:17,775
This is the Number 3 L.

581
00:32:17,777 --> 00:32:20,378
It's made of high carbon steel.
It doesn't break.

582
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,413
That's correct, Dr. Murphy.

583
00:32:35,261 --> 00:32:37,895
Time of incision... 2:05 P.M.

584
00:32:37,897 --> 00:32:39,630
<i>We have a code green...</i>

585
00:32:39,632 --> 00:32:41,802
<i>patient is a Caucasian male,</i>

586
00:32:41,802 --> 00:32:42,809
73 years of age.

587
00:32:42,869 --> 00:32:44,404
Where'd he go?

588
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:46,904
Yeah, on my way.

589
00:32:49,993 --> 00:32:53,054
I have a five-centimeter segment
of proximal jejunum.

590
00:32:53,056 --> 00:32:55,312
It's... sclerotic, but not perforated.

591
00:32:55,314 --> 00:32:57,281
All right, mark it and move on.

592
00:32:57,283 --> 00:32:58,883
Shaun, why are you just standing there?

593
00:32:58,885 --> 00:33:00,503
We have 25 feet of bowel to run.

594
00:33:02,449 --> 00:33:05,289
Shaun, you need to get moving...
unless you've found something.

595
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,124
I have...

596
00:33:07,126 --> 00:33:09,021
- the perforation.
- Clamp it off...

597
00:33:09,023 --> 00:33:10,161
I'll get in there
with the enterotomy scissors

598
00:33:10,163 --> 00:33:12,263
and remove the damaged segment.

599
00:33:12,682 --> 00:33:14,065
I can't.

600
00:33:15,901 --> 00:33:18,116
You can't? Why not?

601
00:33:18,118 --> 00:33:20,104
It's a phlegmon.

602
00:33:20,106 --> 00:33:21,772
You found a walled-off abscess?

603
00:33:21,774 --> 00:33:22,673
It's large.

604
00:33:22,675 --> 00:33:24,408
- Don't touch it.
- I already am.

605
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:26,043
If you move and that thing ruptures,

606
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:28,095
the pus will spread to his
entire abdominal cavity...

607
00:33:28,097 --> 00:33:29,195
this boy dies.

608
00:33:29,197 --> 00:33:30,748
I know, that's why I'm not moving.

609
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,583
Claire, I need you to open it up gently.

610
00:33:32,585 --> 00:33:34,351
I'm gonna evacuate the septic contents,

611
00:33:34,353 --> 00:33:35,953
flush the cavity with antibiotics,

612
00:33:35,955 --> 00:33:37,288
and then I'm gonna have you
remove the capsule.

613
00:33:38,424 --> 00:33:39,723
I didn't do anything.

614
00:33:39,725 --> 00:33:40,991
That's the pressure tanking.

615
00:33:40,993 --> 00:33:43,094
You need to finish
what you're doing right now.

616
00:33:46,231 --> 00:33:48,065
Let's go, Claire. Come on.

617
00:33:51,369 --> 00:33:52,770
Clamp.

618
00:33:52,772 --> 00:33:55,005
Uh, you guys check left.

619
00:34:02,715 --> 00:34:05,549
Hey. Hey. Come on.

620
00:34:05,551 --> 00:34:07,153
Stop.

621
00:34:09,072 --> 00:34:10,454
Come on, Glen.

622
00:34:10,456 --> 00:34:11,844
We can do this.

623
00:34:11,846 --> 00:34:13,023
I don't want to...

624
00:34:13,025 --> 00:34:15,017
I just don't want to.

625
00:34:15,019 --> 00:34:17,728
Please leave me alone.

626
00:34:18,832 --> 00:34:21,793
Once I get my strength back,
I'll climb up and jump.

627
00:34:24,336 --> 00:34:26,270
I can't let you do that.

628
00:34:37,015 --> 00:34:38,983
When this temporary pacer fails,

629
00:34:39,647 --> 00:34:41,020
which it will,

630
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:44,922
your heart may stop and you die suddenly.

631
00:34:44,924 --> 00:34:46,718
But more likely, Glen,

632
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,526
you slip back into that slow rhythm,

633
00:34:48,528 --> 00:34:50,794
your chest is racked
with excruciating pain

634
00:34:50,796 --> 00:34:52,663
and your lungs start to fill with fluid,

635
00:34:52,665 --> 00:34:53,831
and slowly you suffocate.

636
00:34:54,242 --> 00:34:56,267
Eh, give it a rest, 28.

637
00:34:56,536 --> 00:34:59,069
Just get me a DNR and a cab.

638
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:01,272
You can't help me.

639
00:35:10,383 --> 00:35:12,516
Yes, I can.

640
00:35:24,439 --> 00:35:27,097
It was a difficult procedure.

641
00:35:27,099 --> 00:35:29,300
We removed a total of two feet of...

642
00:35:29,302 --> 00:35:30,367
Is he okay?

643
00:35:30,369 --> 00:35:31,835
He will be okay.

644
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:35,339
Thank you.

645
00:35:36,776 --> 00:35:40,288
Thank you, thank you.

646
00:35:43,448 --> 00:35:46,753
I-I'm sorry. We're... We just...

647
00:35:49,964 --> 00:35:51,589
He's our son.

648
00:35:51,591 --> 00:35:53,591
You shouldn't feel bad.

649
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:56,126
You did what you thought
was best for Liam.

650
00:35:56,128 --> 00:35:57,847
You love Liam.

651
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:01,142
I didn't have that from my parents.

652
00:36:03,269 --> 00:36:05,269
It also means I didn't have
to take kava root,

653
00:36:05,271 --> 00:36:06,170
so I didn't get

654
00:36:06,172 --> 00:36:08,105
hypereosinophilic gastroenteritis.

655
00:36:24,055 --> 00:36:27,001
Are you gonna get in trouble for this?

656
00:36:28,878 --> 00:36:30,630
You're worried about me now?

657
00:36:32,173 --> 00:36:33,841
You signed the DNR.

658
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,400
All I'm doing is sitting with you.

659
00:37:02,628 --> 00:37:04,528
Are you feeling any anxiety?

660
00:37:05,123 --> 00:37:06,964
No.

661
00:37:06,966 --> 00:37:08,666
Pain?

662
00:37:08,668 --> 00:37:10,768
Some.

663
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:13,589
Would you like a dose
of morphine to help with that?

664
00:37:42,668 --> 00:37:44,746
Thank you.

665
00:38:15,004 --> 00:38:16,505
Find your guy?

666
00:38:17,028 --> 00:38:18,446
I did.

667
00:38:20,177 --> 00:38:22,277
Put in the biventricular?

668
00:38:25,682 --> 00:38:28,183
How long did it take to get
access to the coronary sinus?

669
00:38:30,754 --> 00:38:32,376
I didn't do the surgery.

670
00:38:34,658 --> 00:38:36,964
I didn't put the pacer in. He, um...

671
00:38:37,628 --> 00:38:39,795
he didn't want it.

672
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:49,104
He was a good guy.

673
00:38:57,714 --> 00:39:00,255
I lost a patient, too.

674
00:39:05,054 --> 00:39:06,254
Want to talk about it?

675
00:39:12,329 --> 00:39:13,728
I do.

676
00:39:43,393 --> 00:39:45,533
Your surgery went well.

677
00:39:46,163 --> 00:39:48,730
You should be able to get up
and move around in two weeks

678
00:39:48,732 --> 00:39:51,399
once we're sure the antibiotics
have cleared your infection.

679
00:39:51,401 --> 00:39:53,001
Hear that?

680
00:39:53,003 --> 00:39:55,470
It won't be too long
until we can go home.

681
00:39:55,472 --> 00:39:57,539
You did great, honey.

682
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:04,012
The lights.

683
00:40:09,052 --> 00:40:10,318
Are the lights okay?

684
00:40:12,422 --> 00:40:13,822
Do you want them dimmed?

685
00:40:17,861 --> 00:40:21,463
They're... okay.

686
00:40:39,982 --> 00:40:41,672
You'll love the software.

687
00:40:42,152 --> 00:40:44,386
It makes it very easy to budget.

688
00:40:44,388 --> 00:40:47,122
And the best part,
it links directly to the bank,

689
00:40:47,124 --> 00:40:48,924
and... get rid of the ball!

690
00:40:48,926 --> 00:40:52,060
He was the first quarterback
picked in 2013,

691
00:40:52,062 --> 00:40:55,830
but his stats outside the pocket
are only 27% competed passes.

692
00:40:55,832 --> 00:40:59,501
Their backup QB is at 65% under pressure.

693
00:40:59,503 --> 00:41:01,136
Absolutely.

694
00:41:01,138 --> 00:41:03,805
- He's wasted potential on the bench.
- Yes.

695
00:41:03,807 --> 00:41:07,242
Anyway, the link to the bank
will help make automatic...

696
00:41:07,244 --> 00:41:08,810
- Oh!
- Oh!

697
00:41:08,812 --> 00:41:10,078
Did you see that?

698
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,747
He pinned it against
his helmet... even with the PI!

699
00:41:12,749 --> 00:41:14,316
I want to go to the Super Bowl.

700
00:41:14,318 --> 00:41:16,351
Okay, see,
that's exactly the kind of thing

701
00:41:16,353 --> 00:41:18,253
you have to think about before you buy.

702
00:41:18,255 --> 00:41:20,288
Tickets are very expensive.

703
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:22,591
Oh, hoo-hoo-hoo!

704
00:41:25,161 --> 00:41:27,028
You know... You know what? You should go.

705
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:28,430
I should go. We should go.

706
00:41:28,432 --> 00:41:29,331
Okay.

707
00:41:29,333 --> 00:41:30,999
Excuse me.

708
00:41:31,001 --> 00:41:33,468
Uh, it's almost closing time, so...

709
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:35,670
I'd like to buy this TV.

710
00:41:39,208 --> 00:41:41,209
...stay as long as you like.

711
