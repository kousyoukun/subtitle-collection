- He's wasted potential on the bench.
- Yes.

818
00:41:03,807 --> 00:41:07,242
Anyway, the link to the bank
will help make automatic...

819
00:41:07,244 --> 00:41:08,810
- Oh! [LAUGHS]
- Oh!

820
00:41:08,812 --> 00:41:10,078
Did you see that?

821
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,747
He pinned it against
his helmet... even with the PI!

822
00:41:12,749 --> 00:41:14,316
I want to go to the Super Bowl.

823
00:41:14,318 --> 00:41:16,351
Okay, see,
that's exactly the kind of thing

824
00:41:16,353 --> 00:41:18,253
you have to think about before you buy.

825
00:41:18,255 --> 00:41:20,288
Tickets are very expensive.

826
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:22,591
- Oh, hoo-hoo-hoo!
- [LAUGHS]

827
00:41:25,161 --> 00:41:27,028
You know... You know what? You should go.

828
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:28,430
I should go. We should go.

829
00:41:28,432 --> 00:41:29,331
Okay.

830
00:41:29,333 --> 00:41:30,999
Excuse me. [CHUCKLES]

831
00:41:31,001 --> 00:41:33,468
Uh, it's almost closing time, so...

832
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:35,670
I'd like to buy this TV.

833
00:41:39,208 --> 00:41:41,209
...stay as long as you like.
