It's okay, sweetie,

00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:35,995
it's not your fault.

I just wanted to play

Daddy's not dead.

He's gonna be
okay, right?

7
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:44,420
He had a stroke.

That's not possible.

8
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:46,338
Well, the CT confirmed
a ruptured aneurysm.

9
00:00:46,422 --> 00:00:47,798
We have to operate to clip
the bleeding

10
00:00:47,882 --> 00:00:49,049
and reduce
intracranial pressure.

11
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:50,634
No, he had a stroke
six years ago.

12
00:00:50,718 --> 00:00:52,011

on diltiazem.

good care of your dad.

Don't suggest to the head
of Surgery that working
with the head of Surgery

of punishment.

with Jared

his job back.

unhappy with me
for taking two days off...

he wants to talk
about this, Shaun.

Well, there are
a lot of idiots.

Okay. What do we need
to do here, Murphy?

31
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:48,442
A superficial
partial-thickness burn

32
00:01:48,526 --> 00:01:50,069
should be managed
conservatively.

33
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:52,154
Cleanse the area,
debride with soft gauze,

34
00:01:52,238 --> 00:01:55,699
and then cover with
an antimicrobial
petroleum dressing.

35
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:58,661
All of which means
this should heal
with minimal scarring.

don't have a theory?

173
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:18,165
Or are you refusing
to talk to Jared?

174
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:19,791
I didn't answer
because it doesn't matter

175
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,168
until we can repair
this puncture

176
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:23,712
before bacteria passes
through and spreads
an infection.

177
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:25,172
That's true.

178
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:26,340
Cut this suture.

179
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:28,300
Let's approximate
the edges
with forceps.

180
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,385
Are you and Jared
even now?

181
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:34,681
He made a mistake,
so did you.

182
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:36,308
Exactly what mistake
did I make?

183
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:38,560
SHAUN: This breach
was your fault.

184
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,855
Is that traumatic?

185
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:51,657
I had breakfast
by myself.

186
00:08:51,907 --> 00:08:52,950
Where were you?

187
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,494
I'm sorry. Were we
supposed to have
breakfast this morning?

188
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:56,620
I had an early consult.

189
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:00,499
Yes. We always have
breakfast on Mondays.

190
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,584
We do?

Every Monday.

191
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:04,461
Every Monday.

192
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,587
Thank you.

193
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:09,675
Well, I guess our streak
has been broken then, huh?

194
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:12,636
If someone punctures
the bronchus

195
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:15,889
during a routine
bronchoscopy, that's
a mistake, right?

196
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,809
Well, I can't imagine
how it wouldn't be.

197
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,269
Why? What did
you do, Shaun?

198
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:23,772
I'm wondering if I need
to report Dr. Melendez.

199
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:25,941
Dr. Melendez did that?

200
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:27,818
The protocol
is very clear.

201
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:29,569
I need to report it.

202
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:34,366
But I've seen how Jared
is being treated.

203
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:37,911
Will Dr. Melendez treat
me badly if I report this?

204
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:42,499
He shouldn't, obviously.
But human nature
being what...

205
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:45,752
Human nature?

206
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:51,425
Shaun, you know what?
You should make this
decision for yourself.

207
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:58,515
In fact,
you should make

208
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,892
all your decisions
yourself from
here on in.

209
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:04,938
That's what we
agreed on, right?

210
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:13,488
Have you considered
an endovascular
embolization procedure?

211
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:16,742
I have. It's a little
less risky, but I
haven't done as many.

212
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:18,910
So, I'm not sure
which way
we're better off.

213
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:20,329
You want me
to check the roster?

214
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:22,164
See if there's
somebody available
with more experience?

215
00:10:22,748 --> 00:10:24,291
I would like to assist,
but yes.

216
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:27,544
Okay, here we go.

217
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,006
No, he's not available.

218
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:32,758
So make him available.

219
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,176
I got a husband
and father

220
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:36,428
who presented
with two aneurysms
in the last 12 hours.

221
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,389
I'd rather not.
This particular surgeon

222
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:42,684
was recently
transferred.

223
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:48,732
Not a chance.

224
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:53,278
Coyle is the best
available surgeon
for the job.

225
00:10:53,362 --> 00:10:54,696
Coyle should
have been fired.

226
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,531
And if he'd been
fired, he wouldn't
be available.

227
00:10:56,615 --> 00:10:57,657
And if he
wasn't available,

228
00:10:57,741 --> 00:10:59,201
you would be the best
person for the job.

229
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:02,454
Our ultimate duty
is to the patient.

230
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:06,166
No, it's not.

231
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:09,169
You agree he should
have been fired?

232
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,380
Of course...

Even if he was
the best doctor

233
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:13,298
in the hospital,
he should have
been fired, right?

234
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:15,217
Yes.

235
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,345
So some things have
to matter more than
who is the most skilled.

236
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:22,057
If we forgive Coyle
just because
he's good at something,

237
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:23,642
what does he do next?

238
00:11:24,935 --> 00:11:26,728
Either he matters,
or we matter.

239
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:38,281
Were you upset
during the procedure?

240
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:41,952
Did Murphy tell you
that I was traumatized?

241
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,579
You think that I might have
almost killed a person

242
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:45,747
because you dumped me?

243
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:47,958
The fact that
you're describing
it as me dumping you

244
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,668
suggests that
you are upset.

245
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:54,673
Look, I'm fine,
you're fine,
nobody's upset.

246
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:55,924
Great.

247
00:11:57,092 --> 00:11:59,761
But you do understand
that I have to ask you
these questions?

248
00:12:00,137 --> 00:12:01,763
That I need
a statement from you?

249
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:04,516
Yes. Here's my statement.

250
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:07,686
I wasn't distracted.
I didn't screw up.

251
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:09,271
Did you get all that?

252

(ELEVATOR DINGS)

253
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,658
Your bronchus
was punctured
during the procedure,

254
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:25,078
but it's been repaired.

How? How could
that happen?

255
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:26,705
Why did you lie?

256
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:28,832
You said that
you inhaled smoke,

257
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,667
but there was
no evidence of smoke.

258
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:33,211
So, what do you gain
by lying to your doctors?

259
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:37,716
I wasn't lying.
I was just confused,
I guess.

260
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:41,136
I was in a lot of pain
and it was all
happening so fast.

you feeling?

Four milligrams
of ondansetron.

Airway inflammation,
abdominal pain, nausea...

269

We need a full blood panel
and abdominal ultrasound.

(VOMITING)

271
00:13:02,908 --> 00:13:06,036
The procedure
will seal off
the aneurysm,

272
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:09,664
but there will
almost certainly
be some brain damage.

273
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:13,335
Anything from mild visual
or speech disturbances

But without
the surgery, he'll die.

276
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:30,310
No.

277
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:33,146
I won't consent
to the operation.

278
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:37,359
There really isn't
a lot of choice here.

279

Without the operation...

After his first stroke,

280
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,323
it took him so long
to recover.

281
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:49,204
It was frustrating
and painful for him.

282
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:51,331
But he did recover.

283
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:59,172
He made it clear
he'd never want
to live compromised.

(WEAKLY) Excuse me.

My pleasure.

287

People lie a lot,
don't they?

288
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:25,073
No, I meant it, Shaun.
I'm happy to spend
time with you.

289
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:28,159
There are seven reasons
that I've thought of.

290
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:30,829
There may even
be more.

291
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,749
Do people ever lie
without a reason?

292
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:35,875
No.

293
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,050
Reason number six.
I think you just lied.

294
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:45,885
I think you just lied
to avoid something.

295
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:49,764
You don't like this
conversation.
Shaun? Shaun, I'm sorry.

296
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:52,684
I'm just... I'm just
a little distracted.

297
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:55,312
My aneurysm patient,
we're treating him

298
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:57,897
with blood pressure
meds to try
and avoid a rupture.

299
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:01,192
You should do
an endovascular
embolization.

300
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:03,778
He doesn't want one. It could
leave him with brain damage.

301
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:06,906
I thought
he was unconscious.
He is.

302
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:08,825
But his wife knows
what he wants.

303
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:12,787
It's amazing. I just...

304
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:14,289
I don't think
I'd be able to do that.

305
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:18,251
She's sacrificing
her happiness,
her future,

306
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:20,128
just because she knows...

She's lying.

307
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:25,133
She's lying. It could be
either reason
number four, or...

308
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:27,052
No, she's not
lying, Shaun.
She loves him.

309
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:29,638
She doesn't love him.

You haven't even met her.

310
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:31,264
You haven't seen
what she's like
with him,

311
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:33,600
with their son...

I'm not good
at reading people.

312
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:36,061
Well, I am...

I think people-reading

313
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,355
embraces
personal biases.

314
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:41,316
I think we should try
to avoid biases.

315
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,195
Knowledge of
human behavior

316
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:48,573
can help us
make informed,
intuitive decisions.

317
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,283
My way is better.

318
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:52,744
It's based on actions.
She's lying.

319
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,121
Okay.

320
00:15:55,205 --> 00:15:57,040
If you love someone,

321
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,834
you'll do anything
to prevent their death.

322
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:11,513
This situation, there
seems to be
a conflict of interest.

323
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:16,309
So, I would like to bring
in someone else from
legal to handle it.

324
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:18,478
Yeah, I agree.

325
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:21,314
You're an excellent
lawyer, but...

326
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:23,525
But what?

327
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:25,652
Do you think this
is my problem?

328
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:27,112
It's understandable.

329
00:16:27,404 --> 00:16:28,822
Forty-eight hours ago,
we were engaged.

330
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:31,574
And now, suddenly
you're supposed to be
investigating me?

331
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:32,701
Yes.

332
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,161
And doing crazy things
like expecting you

333
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:38,039
to give me complete answers
to appropriate questions.

334
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:40,417
You were trusting Murphy's
judgement over mine.

335
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,711
His judgement about
my demeanor.

336
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:44,212
Seriously?

337
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:46,131
I asked you a question.

338
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:47,799
You wanted me
to screw up.

339
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:50,218
You did screw up.
So what?

340
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:52,220
So we just
deal with it.

341
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:55,223
But if you
can't even admit

342
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:57,559
that you're not always
perfect...

another explanation.

There are other ways
to explain the presence
of methanol.

380
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:05,413
It's also produced
by the liver

381
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:08,166
when the body is
exposed to certain
caustic chemicals.

382
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:11,419
If inhaled, caustic
chemicals could also
inflame the lungs.

383
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:14,797
And caustic chemicals
also burn. So it would
explain all her symptoms.

Do you happen to have
a list of which caustic
chemicals do all that?

Dimethyl sulfate.

It's used in

392
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:34,901
But she could be a school

We don't have
her consent.

Technically, the issue
is we don't have

I mean, for all we know,
she wants her
husband dead

run off with her
Pilates instructor.

I'll get the consent.

She refused
initial treatment
for methanol toxicity.

410
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:27,161
It's ethanol. Because
she's Muslim, she
can't consume it.

She has alcohol
in her system,

412

but won't let us
put alcohol in her
system to treat it

413

because she doesn't
want alcohol
in her system.

Dr. Murphy.

415

Is this part of
your evidence
that she's a terrorist?

416

Because she's
a Muslim?

417

There are billions
of Muslims
that aren't terrorists.

Is that part
of your evidence
that she's not?

00:21:44,262 --> 00:21:45,555
I think she's
a terrorist

420

a little better.

515
00:27:59,512 --> 00:28:01,430
And sometimes
things still suck.

516
00:28:04,934 --> 00:28:05,976
Entering the aneurysm.

517
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:10,356
Okay.

518
00:28:10,773 --> 00:28:11,941
(BEEPING RAPIDLY)

519
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:13,734
Blood pressure's spiking.

Wait, why?

520
00:28:13,943 --> 00:28:16,487
There's no rupture,
no bleeding,
no stroke.

521
00:28:16,946 --> 00:28:19,156
If his BP goes up any higher,
he will have a stroke.

522
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:21,575
I'm terminating
the procedure.

523
00:28:22,243 --> 00:28:24,286
Push 20 milligrams
of labetalol, stat.

524
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:35,047
We need to stabilize
him before we can
retry the procedure.

525
00:28:35,131 --> 00:28:37,466
Which means
we need to figure
out what we missed.

526
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:38,843
This wasn't our fault.

527
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:41,053
His BP was
stable going in.

528
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,013
He's been on calcium
channel blockers

529
00:28:43,097 --> 00:28:44,890
the last six years...

Well, we missed something.

530
00:28:44,974 --> 00:28:46,684
BP doesn't skyrocket
for no reason.

531
00:28:48,853 --> 00:28:49,895
Run a full workup.

532
00:28:52,857 --> 00:28:53,983
Why would
a 28-year-old

533
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:55,985
with no risk factors
have a heart attack?

534
00:28:56,152 --> 00:28:57,570
Mm.

535
00:28:58,028 --> 00:28:59,238
Her heart is burning.

536
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:02,032
Burning?

537
00:29:02,116 --> 00:29:03,492
From the caustic
chemical.

538
00:29:03,868 --> 00:29:06,954
Murphy...

It's going through
her system.

539
00:29:07,288 --> 00:29:11,125
Unlike thermal burns,
chemical burns get
worse over time.

540
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,420
And it also explains
the punctured bronchus.

541
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:16,630
The caustic
chemical thinned
the bronchial walls.

542
00:29:16,797 --> 00:29:18,382
You did not make
a mistake.

543
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,050
That's not the only
explanation.

544
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:22,761
But I'll shut up now.

545
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:25,931
You think you have
a good idea, but you're
going to shut yourself up?

546
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,644
It could be caused
by an infection from
the bacteria that leaked,

547
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:32,605
as a result
of the puncture.

548
00:29:33,189 --> 00:29:36,775
The treatments
are diametrically opposed.

549
00:29:36,859 --> 00:29:41,322
Antibiotics if it's
infection, steroids
if it's inflammation.

550
00:29:41,405 --> 00:29:44,366
If we give antibiotics
and she needs
steroids instead,

551
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:45,784
it will suppress
her immune system,

552
00:29:45,868 --> 00:29:47,786
causing the infection
to flourish and kill her.

553
00:29:48,204 --> 00:29:51,332
If she needs steroids and we
give her antibiotics, then...

554
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:54,627
I get it, we better
be right.
Yes.

555
00:29:55,169 --> 00:29:57,922
Sir, I think we should
bring another senior
attending in

556
00:29:58,005 --> 00:30:00,090
to consult on
this decision.
Why?

557
00:30:00,174 --> 00:30:01,884
Because if Shaun's right,
you're exonerated.

558
00:30:02,426 --> 00:30:03,761
And if I'm right,
you may have made
the mistake

559
00:30:03,844 --> 00:30:04,887
that could kill
this woman.

560
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:08,224
You don't think
I can be objective?

561
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,184
I think you're
incredibly professional...

562
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:11,310
Shut up, Jared.

563
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:18,526
It is possible
that I screwed up.

564
00:30:21,612 --> 00:30:23,155
Let's put her
on broad spectrum
antibiotics.

565
00:30:23,906 --> 00:30:25,032
You're wrong.

566
00:30:25,908 --> 00:30:30,162
Making a decision on
the assumption you made
a mistake is a mistake.

567
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,206
You're very arrogant.

a great surgeon.

need your approval.

We've determined
what the underlying
problem was.

571
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:56,063
What caused your husband's
aneurysm to rupture,

572
00:30:56,146 --> 00:30:58,315
and why his blood pressure
spiked in the OR.

573
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:00,985
According to his labs,
he hasn't been
taking his meds.

574
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,279
As far as I know,
he has.

575
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:05,364
I mean, that's just
not like him.

576
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:07,533
We don't think
it's like him either.

577
00:31:10,703 --> 00:31:13,038
You think I had something
to do with this?

578
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:14,790
That I what?

579
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:16,417
Threw his meds away?

580
00:31:17,668 --> 00:31:18,752
He'd just order more.

581
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:21,880
But if you emptied
his capsules

582
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:25,259
and filled them with sugar,
or even better, salt...

583
00:31:26,427 --> 00:31:27,761
It would end
your nightmare.

584
00:31:31,265 --> 00:31:32,975
I was willing
to let him die.

586
00:31:39,732 --> 00:31:42,443

to kill him...

son knows more than
you think he does?

588

589
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,733
That's in
the normal range.

590
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:25,152
But it was 83.
It should be going down.

591
00:32:25,486 --> 00:32:27,821

are normal.

00:39:46,343 --> 00:39:51,431
I said that I would
back off if you
stayed, right?

689
00:39:51,515 --> 00:39:54,059
More space, less fathering?

I don't need a father,

690
00:39:54,142 --> 00:39:55,560
I hate fathers.

691
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:58,188
Right, so...

I need a friend.

692
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:08,198
Shaun, I am someone
who can't help
but give advice.

693
00:40:08,365 --> 00:40:11,910
You know, I don't know
if I can not do that.

694
00:40:14,871 --> 00:40:18,458
So, you think I can change
and you can't?

695
00:40:21,253 --> 00:40:23,547
I think that we have a certain
kind of relationship,

696
00:40:24,381 --> 00:40:26,633
and we can call it
something different
if we want,

697
00:40:26,716 --> 00:40:29,219
but we can't magically
make it different.

698
00:40:30,095 --> 00:40:33,140
You said that you
wanted space, you said
that you needed space.

699
00:40:40,522 --> 00:40:43,275
I think you should
be my friend.

700
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:51,783
Shaun...

701
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:07,507
Okay.

702
00:41:11,386 --> 00:41:12,429
