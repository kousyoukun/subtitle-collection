1
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,390
-我来晚了  -没事  宝贝  不怪你
- I was late! - It's okay, sweetie. It's not your fault.

2
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:37,020
我只想在盖瑞家再玩把游戏
I just wanted to play one more game at Gary's.

3
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,480
你做得很好  立即打了急救电话
Well, you did great. You called 911 right away.

4
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,230
-他好像死了  -爸爸没死
- He looked dead. - Daddy's not dead.

5
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:42,740
他会没事的  对吧
He's gonna be okay, right?

6
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,470
-他中风了  -不可能
- He had a stroke. - That's not possible!

7
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:46,350
CT扫描证实动脉瘤破裂了
Well, the CT confirmed a ruptured aneurysm.

8
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:47,860
得做手术止血
We have to operate to clip the bleeding

9
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:48,830
释放颅内压
and reduce intracranial pressure.

10
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:50,680
不  他六年前中过风
No, he had a stroke six years ago.

11
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,250
当时用了地尔硫卓
They put him on diltiazem.

12
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,610
我们会救治你爸爸的
We're gonna take good care of your dad.

13
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,710
纳吉·莫迪  28岁  左手有烧伤
Naja Modi -- 28 years old, suffered a burn to her left hand

14
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,840
煮饭时不小心伤到的
as a result of a cooking accident.

15
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,890
我和杰瑞德是在受罚吗
Are Jared and I being punished?

16
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:10,950
这个病例没什么意思吧
This is not a very interesting case, is it?

17
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:12,040
第一
Lesson one --

18
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,480
别在外科主任面前说
Don't suggest to the the head of surgery

19
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,660
跟着外科主任干活
that working with the head of surgery

20
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:17,920
就是在受罚
is form of punishment.

21
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,730
梅伦德斯医生非常不满意
Dr. Melendez is very unhappy with Jared

22
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:23,410
杰瑞德是如何回来工作的
for how he got his job back.

23
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:26,890
梅伦德斯医生也非常不满意我...
And Dr. Melendez is unhappy with me for t-taking --

24
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:28,440
休了两天假
taking two days off.

25
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,140
我觉得他不想谈这事  肖恩
I don't think he wants to talk about this, Shaun.

26
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:36,750
我太蠢了
I was an idiot.

27
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,450
在炉子上啊  肯定很烫
It's on the stove. Of course it's hot, right?

28
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,870
你肯定不相信我们见过多少这种事故
You wouldn't believe how often we see these types of accidents.

29
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:43,750
那蠢货还挺多的
Well, there are a lot of idiots.

30
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,720
现在要怎么处理  莫菲
Okay, what do we need to do here, Murphy?

31
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,410
表面二度烧伤
A superficial partial-thickness burn

32
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:50,070
可以保守处理
should be managed conservatively.

33
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,220
清理烧伤区域  用柔软的纱布清创
Cleanse the area, debride with soft gauze,

34
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,770
用抗菌原油敷料包好
and then cover with an antimicrobial petroleum dressing.

35
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:56,890
也就是说
All of which means,

36
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:59,050
留个小疤就会好了
this should heal with minimal scarring.

37
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,380
纳吉  你胸口疼吗
Naja, are you having chest pain?

38
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,260
我好像心脏病发了
I think I'm having a heart attack.

39
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,510
呼吸困难
It's hard to breathe.

40
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:07,240
尽可能放松
Just relax if you can.

41
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,210
给她输氧  做12导联心电图
Put her on oxygen, a 12 lead EKG,

42
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:11,510
并安排床边胸部X光片
and order a portable chest X-ray.

43
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:12,540
莫菲  走吧  快
Murphy, let's move. Come on.

44
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,920
她的生命体征很稳定
Her vitals are stable.

45
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:18,680
到底怎么回事
What the hell is going on here?

46
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,980
不知道
I don't know.

47
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,430
但很有意思
But it is interesting.

48
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:28,670

50
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,030
蛛网膜下腔出血  抽吸
We've got a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Suction.

51
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:39,850
得隔离动脉瘤
I need to isolate the aneurysm.

52
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,530
可怜的孩子
Poor kid.

53
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,900
想象发现自己的爸爸成这样了
Imagine finding your dad like that.

54
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:47,140
我倒是真想那样死掉
Well, that's exactly how I want to die.

55
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,310
如果他父亲没挺下来
If the dad doesn't make it,

56
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,160
孩子会永远记得那个画面
the kid will always remember that moment --

57
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,340
留下心理创伤
be traumatized by it.

58
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,470
因为他爱他
Because he loves him.

59
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,190
没有任何人因自己的死而伤心...
The idea of dying without anybody getting hurt --

60
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:00,000
最令人悲伤的莫过于空荡荡的等候室
There's nothing sadder than an empty waiting room.

61
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,370
好  看到了什么
Okay, what do you see?

62
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,510
前交通动脉上有个肿块
A bulge on the anterior communicating artery.

63
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:09,460
对  破裂的动脉瘤中断了
Yeah, the ruptured aneurysm is compromising

64
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,950
大脑额叶的供血
blood flow to the frontal lobe.

65
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,110
准备十一毫米的止血钳
Prep an 11 millimeter standard clip.

66
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:14,560
你结婚了吗
Are you married?

67
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,660
离了
Not anymore.

68
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,310
原来他比我还没眼光
Turns out he had even worse judgment than I did.

69
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:21,380
说到变态  你知道科利被调走了吗
Oh, speaking of creeps, you hear Coyle got transferred?

70
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:23,550
他被调走真是太好了
I'm so glad they shut him down.

71
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,010
是啊  我想也是
Well, yeah, I guess.

72
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:28,440
真希望他们把钱用在买小儿创伤舱上
Just wish they'd spent the money on a Pediatric Trauma Pod.

73
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,330
他升职了
They gave him a raise.

74
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:34,910
止血钳
Clip.

75
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,310
心电图证实
The EKG confirmed

76
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,100
你当时没有心脏病发作
you weren't having a heart attack.

77
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,570
我不是装的
I-I wasn't faking.

78
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:42,820
我不会那么做
I wouldn't do that.

79
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:43,720
我们知道
We know.

80
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,300
图像也证实了
The imaging also confirmed

81
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,120
你的肺部炎症很严重
that you have considerable lung inflammation.

82
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,630
你会不会吸到了烟
Is it possible you inhaled smoke?

83
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,250
肯定是吸到了
I guess I must have.

84
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,380
当时油脂引起了一场小火
There was a minor grease fire.

85
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:53,360
现在怎么办
What happens now?

86
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,910
你得做支气管镜检查
You need a bronchoscopy.

87
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:57,280
要从你的喉部插入窥镜检查损伤情况
We put a camera down your throat to see how much damage there is

88
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,810
看看该如何修复
and what we need to do to repair it.

89
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,030
别担心  会给你麻醉的
But don't worry. You'll be sedated.

90
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:01,930
不要
Please don't.

91
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:03,500
抱歉
Oh, I'm -- I'm sorry.

92
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,290
必须做检查
The test is absolutely necessary.

93
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:06,550
检查没问题
The test is fine.

94
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,570
但是
But, um...

95
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:10,540
请别碰我  除非是治疗必须的
please don't touch me, except for medical purposes.

96
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,540
当然
Yeah, of course.

97
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,280
没道理啊
That does not make sense.

98
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,110
很多宗教信仰对触碰都有规矩的
A number of religions have rules about touching.

99
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,060
我不太理解  但
I don't quite get it, but --

100
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,440
这有道理
That makes sense.

101
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,990
除非有很合理的原因
People shouldn't touch people

102
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:28,900
是不该触碰他人
unless there's a very good reason.

103
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,750
好  那么...
Okay, then...

104
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,010
是什么没道理
what doesn't make sense?

105
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,690
油脂起火
The grease fire.

106
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:37,050
油脂起火能解释所有情况
The grease fire explains the whole thing --

107
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,390
烧伤  烟
the burn, the smoke.

108
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:42,020
她说她忘了炉子很烫
She told us she forgot the stove was hot.

109
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,680
如果有东西着火了
How can you forget something's hot

110
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,140
怎么会忘了很烫
when it is on fire?

111
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,790
肖恩  如果她不是突然以为心脏病发了
Shaun, I'm sure we would have heard more of the story

112
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,900
我们肯定能听到更多内容
if she hadn't suddenly thought she was having a heart attack.

113
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:57,660
你为什么不炒了他
Why didn't you fire him?

114
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:59,400
因为他的说辞跟你的不一样
Because his story was different than yours.

115
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,720
而你信了他的说辞
And you believe his story?

116
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,590
我信了你的
I believe your story.

117
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,640
但你没证据
But you can't prove it.

118
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,210
而我们不能简单一味地
And we simply can't make a policy

119
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:10,890
相信每个申诉男人的女人
of believing every woman who files a complaint against every man.

120
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,720
数千年来女人的申诉一直不被信任
After a few thousand years of doing the opposite,

121
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,530
如今矫枉过正又有何不妥
it wouldn't kill us to overcorrect.

122
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,210
而你的男友打了他
And the fact that - your boyfriend assaulted him

123
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,240
让我没了任何筹码
took away any leverage I had.

124
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,790
我尽力了
I did what I could.

125
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,770
我把他调到了
I got him to take a position

126
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:27,610
很少能接触到其他职员和病患的职位
where he has very little contact with staff, with patients --

127
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:28,760
外联职位
outreach chair.

128
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,410
还是个很糟糕的调配
And it's a lousy assignment.

129
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,090
他迟早会辞职的
Sooner or later, he's gonna quit.

130
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,360
然后去其他地方工作
And get a job somewhere else.

131
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,750
如果你有更好的主意
If you have any better ideas...

132
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:40,650
我洗耳恭听
I look forward to hearing them.

133
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,390
你们很幸运
You're very lucky.

134
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:58,220
动脉瘤长在了一条小的交通动脉上
The aneurysm was in a small communicating artery.

135
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:01,200
我们成功修复了受阻大脑区域的供血
We were able to restore blood flow to the impacted brain areas.

136
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,210
他不会有事的
He's gonna be okay.

137
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,200
谢天谢地
Thank God.

138
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:11,330
之后会一直都这样吗
Is this what life is gonna be like from now on?

139
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:14,250
他会时不时病发吗
A-are these things just going to keep happening?

140
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:17,600
他会留院观察几天  做些后续检查
We're gonna keep him here for a few days, do some follow-up testing,

141
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,120
调整一下用药
make some adjustments to his medications.

142
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,880
但愿能找到发病原因
Hopefully, we'll find out why this happened.

143
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:26,550
我得走了
I have to go.

144
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:30,540
又一个
Another one?

145
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:33,240
术后影像显示基底动脉上
Post-operative imaging showed a 26-millimeter aneurysm

146
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,740
有个26毫米的动脉瘤
in the basilar artery.

147
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,440
看这大小和位置  很有可能会破裂
That size and location, we're looking at a high risk of rupture.

148
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,270
他肯定有遗传倾向性
He must have a genetic predisposition --

149
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,230
或许是结缔组织病
maybe a connective tissue disease?

150
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:42,960
在修复之前一切都是空谈
All academic till we repair it.

151
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:48,140
通过咽部过去了  开始探险吧
Through the pharynx and over - to Grandmother's house we go.

152
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:51,020
这是会厌和声带
There's the epiglottis and the vocal cords.

153
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:54,200
我知道你不满意我起诉了医院
I know you're not happy that I sued the hospital.

154
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,340
但我不会为此道歉的
But I'm not gonna apologize for that.

155
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,900
这就好办了
That makes it simple.

156
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:00,290
我这么做  是因为我想留在这
I did it because I want to be here.

157
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,280
我相信能从你那学到很多东西  尽管受你冷落
I believe I can learn a lot from you, even from your doghouse.

158
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:05,930
我只是希望你能给我一个机会
I just hope you give me a chance, sir.

159
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,860
这里是气管隆凸
There's the carina.

160
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,350
接下来要进入左主支气管
Gonna pass into the mainstem bronchus of the left lung.

161
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:14,730
和你未婚妻分手算得上创伤性事件吗
Is breaking up with your fiancée traumatic?

162
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,230
我看见那女人中枪的时候
When I saw a woman get shot,

163
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,960
所有人都说这是精神创伤
everyone told me it was traumatic

164
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,750
说我应该回家休息
and that I should be going home.

165
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,410
你不应该回家休息吗
Should you be going home?

166
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:29,700
给我一个黏膜刷取细胞样本
Give me a mucosal brush for a cellular sample.

167
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,520
这就插入黏膜刷
Loading it now.

168
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,480
从与爱人分手的痛苦中走出来
How long does it take to get over a breakup

169
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,810
需要多长时间
with the woman you love?

170
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:37,480
我看到了大面积炎症
I'm seeing a lot of inflammation,

171
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,940
但是没有油烟损伤
but no smoke damage.

172
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,850
这说得通
That makes se-sense.

173
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,760
我以为做这项检查是因为她吸入了油烟
I thought we were doing this because she inhaled smoke.

174
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,870
她说她吸入了油烟
She said she inhaled smoke.

175
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,590
我不相信她
I didn't believe her.

176
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:49,230
不管原因如何  炎症和损伤是真实存在的
Whatever the cause, the inflammation and the damage are real.

177
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,890
咱们做个粘膜活检
Let's get a mucosal biopsy.

178
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,140
我要移动到这里  我们
I move down here, we --

179
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:55,630
气管镜穿破了她的支气管壁
The scope breached her bronchial wall.

180
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:56,640
她大出血了
She's hemorrhaging.

181
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,930
-太糟糕了  -准备手术
- This is bad. - Prep the O.R.!

182
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:01,570
交叉配血两个单位  我们快走
Type and cross two units of blood. We've gotta move!

183
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:05,760
烧伤是明确的
We know there was a burn.

184
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:08,100
气管损害是不是跟油火有关
Was it something related to the grease fire,

185
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:10,030
或者两者只是独立的巧合
or separate coincidental injury?

186
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:18,280
你是没有想法  还是不想和杰瑞德说话
You don't have a theory, or are you refusing to talk to Jared?

187
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,660
我不回答  是因为我觉得
I didn't answer because it doesn't matter

188
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,020
在我们修复穿孔
until we can repair this puncture

189
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,790
防止细菌进入并传播引起感染前  这不重要
before bacteria passes through and spreads an infection.

190
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,830
说得没错
That's true.

191
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,080
剪线
Cut this suture.

192
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,370
用镊子吻合切缘
Let's approximate the edges with forceps.

193
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:30,520
你和杰瑞德还在闹别扭吗
Are you and Jared even now?

194
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,620
他犯了个错误  你也是
He made a mistake. So did you.

195
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,220
我究竟犯了什么错误
Exactly what mistake did I make?

196
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,660
穿孔是你弄的
This breach was your fault.

197
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,900
这算精神创伤吗
Is that traumatic?

198
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:51,730
我自己吃的早餐
I had breakfast by myself.

199
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,080
你去哪了
Where were you?

200
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:55,540
抱歉  我们今早本来应该一起吃早餐是吗
I'm sorry. Were we supposed to have breakfast this morning?

201
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,810
我今早有个会诊
I had an early consult.

202
00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:00,870
对  我们每周一都一起吃早餐
Yes, we always have breakfast on Mondays.

203
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,920
是吗  每周一
We do? Every Monday.

204
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,490
每周一
Every Monday.

205
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,220
谢谢
Thank you.

206
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:09,850
我猜我们的冷战已经告一段落了  是吗
Well, I guess our streak has been broken then, huh?

207
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,790
如果某人在常规支气管镜操作中
If someone punctures the bronchus

208
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,140
穿破了支气管  这算是错误  对吗
during a routine bronchoscopy, that's a mistake, right?

209
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,810
肯定是错误
Well, I can't imagine how it wouldn't be.

210
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:20,400
怎么了  你做了什么  肖恩
Why? What did you do, Shaun?

211
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,280
我想知道我是否要举报梅伦德斯医生
I'm wondering if I need to report Dr. Melendez.

212
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,000
梅伦德斯医生干的
Dr. Melendez did that?

213
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,130
规定写得很清楚
The protocol is very clear.

214
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:29,890
我得举报
I need to report it.

215
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:34,480
但是我看见他怎么对杰瑞德的
But I've seen how Jared is being treated.

216
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,840
如果我举报了梅伦德斯医生
Will Dr. Melendez treat me badly

217
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,180
他会不会也冷落我
if I report this?

218
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:41,030
显然  他不应该这样
He shouldn't, obviously.

219
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,890
但是人性就是这么...
But human nature being what...

220
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,000
人性
Human nature?

221
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,550
肖恩  你知道吗
Shaun, you know what?

222
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,770
这件事应该由你自己决定
You should make this decision for yourself.

223
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,640
其实  其实...
In fact -- In fact...

224
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:01,280
从现在开始  所有的决定都应该由你自己来做
you should to make - all your decisions yourself from here on in.

225
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:05,320
这是我们说好的  对吗
That's what we agreed on, right?

226
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,690
你有考虑过血管内栓塞术吗
Have you considered an endovascular embolization procedure?

227
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:14,540
考虑了
I have.

228
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,670
风险会降低
It's a little less risky,

229
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:16,820
但是我做得不多
but I haven't done as many,

230
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:19,170
所以我不确定怎么做比较好
so I'm not sure which way we're better off.

231
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:20,300
你是不是想让我查一下名单
You want me to check the roster --

232
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,450
看看有没有更有经验的医生能够胜任
see if there's somebody available with more experience?

233
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,560
是的  我可以从旁协助
I would like to assist, but yes.

234
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,710
好的  我们来看看
Okay, here we go.

235
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,340
不  他没法做
No, he's not available.

236
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,970
那就想方设法让他做
So make him available.

237
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,230
身为人夫和人父
I got a husband and father

238
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,820
他在过去的十二小时里已经出现两个动脉瘤了
who presented with two aneurysms in the last 12 hours.

239
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:38,290
最好不要
I'd rather not.

240
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:40,650
那位外科医生最近被...
This particular surgeon was recently...

241
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:42,970
调职了
transferred.

242
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,110
没门
Not a chance.

243
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:53,500
科利是这项手术的最佳人选
Coyle is the best available surgeon for the job.

244
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,560
科利本应该被解雇  如果他被解雇了
Coyle should've been fired, and if he'd been fired,

245
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,670
他根本不可能来做这手术
he wouldn't be available.

246
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:57,760
如果他不能做
And if he wasn't available,

247
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,520
你将会是这项手术的最佳人选
you would be the best person for the job.

248
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,470
我们应该以患者为重
Our ultimate duty is to the patient.

249
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:06,210
不  不是
No, it's not.

250
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,460
你同意他应该被解雇
You agree he should have been fired.

251
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,210
当然
Of course.

252
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:12,120
就算他是这家医院里最好的医生
Even if he was the - best doctor in this hospital,

253
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,620
他也应该被解雇  对吗
he should have been fired, right?

254
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,190
对
Yes.

255
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,970
所以有些事情
So some things have to matter more

256
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:18,770
比谁的手术技术高超更重要
than who is the most skilled.

257
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:22,130
如果科利擅长于某些领域  就能因此得到原谅
If we forgive Coyle just because he's good at something,

258
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:23,990
他接下来会做些什么
what does he do next?

259
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,030
要么选他  要么选我们
Either he matters or we matter.

260
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,600
你在手术过程中感到烦恼吗
Were you upset during the procedure?

261
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,350
莫菲告诉你我有「精神创伤」了
Did Murphy tell you that I was "Traumatized"?

262
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,650
你觉得我差点害死了一个人
You think that I might have almost killed a person

263
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:45,930
都是因为你甩了我
because you dumped me?

264
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:48,130
事实上  你把这件事说成「我甩了你」
The fact that you're describing it as "Me dumping you"

265
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:50,040
恰恰说明你为此心烦意乱
suggests that you are upset.

266
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,570
听着  我没事  你也没事
Look, I'm fine. You're fine.

267
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:54,920
没人为此烦心
Nobody's upset.

268
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,770
很好
Great.

269
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,100
但是你要明白
But you do understand

270
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,150
我必须得问你这些问题
that I have to ask you these questions,

271
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,940
因为我需要你给个说法
that I need a statement from you.

272
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,650
明白
Yes.

273
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:04,890
这就是我的说法
Here's my statement --

274
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,890
「我没有分心
"I wasn't distracted.

275
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:08,150
我没有搞砸」
I didn't screw up."

276
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,420
你听明白了吧
You get all that?

277
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,820
你的支气管在手术过程中发生了穿孔
Your bronchus was punctured during the procedure,

278
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:22,940
不过穿孔已经修复好了
but it's been repaired.

279
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:25,410
什么  怎么会这样
How? How could that happen?

280
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,010
为什么说谎
Why did you lie?

281
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,990
你说你吸入了油烟
You said that you inhaled smoke,

282
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,970
但支气管里根本没有油烟
but there was no evidence of smoke.

283
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,640
所以向你的医生撒谎  你能得到什么好处
So, what do you gain by lying to your doctors?

284
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,720
我没有撒谎
I wasn't lying.

285
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,830
我只是...
I was just...

286
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,960
迷糊了  我想
confused, I guess.

287
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,380
我很痛
I was in a lot of pain,

288
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,570
而且一切发生的太快了
and it was all happening so fast.

289
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,020
我的胃
My stomach!

290
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:46,010
纳吉  你有什么感觉
Naja, what are you feeling?

291
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:49,140
真的很痛...我感觉我要...
It's really sore and... I feel like I'm going to--

292
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:51,210
这里需要帮助
Can we get some help over here?!

293
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,520
四毫克昂丹司琼
Four milligrams of ondansetron.

294
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:57,440
气道炎症  腹痛  恶心
Airway inflammation, abdominal pain, nausea.

295
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,070
我们需要做全套血液化验和腹部超声
We need a full blood panel and abdominal ultrasound.

296
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:06,120
手术会夹闭动脉瘤
The procedure will seal off the aneurysm,

297
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,980
但很有可能会造成一些脑损伤
but there will almost certainly be some brain damage --

298
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:13,530
从轻微的视觉障碍或语言障碍
anything from mild visual or speech disturbances

299
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:16,600
到严重的瘫痪  都有可能
to significant paralysis.

300
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,560
但不做手术  他会死
But without the surgery, he'll die.

301
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,440
不  我不同意做手术
No. I-I won't consent to the operation.

302
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,160
你没有太多选择的余地
There really isn't a lot of choice here.

303
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,210
不做手术
Without the operation --

304
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:40,550
在他第一次中风后
After his first stroke, it --

305
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:43,630
他花了很长时间才恢复过来
it took him so long to recover.

306
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:49,540
对他来说  这个过程非常痛苦沮丧
It was frustrating and painful for him.

307
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,600
但是他最终恢复过来了
But he did recover.

308
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:59,610
他很清楚  他不想生活在妥协中
He made it clear he'd never want to live compromised.

309
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,560
抱歉
Excuse me.

310
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,970
谢谢你和我一起吃早餐
Thank you for having breakfast with me.

311
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:19,470
这是我的荣幸
My pleasure.

312
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,340
人们经常撒谎  对吗
People lie a lot, don't they?

313
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:24,270
不  我是认真的  肖恩
No, I-I meant it, Shaun.

314
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,080
我很开心能和你共度时光
I'm happy to spend time with you.

315
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:28,580
我想到了七个原因
There are seven reasons that I've thought of.

316
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:31,080
也许还有更多
There may even be more.

317
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,780
人们会毫无理由地撒谎吗
Do people ever lie without a reason?

318
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:35,750
不会
No.

319
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:44,190
第六个原因  我认为你刚刚撒谎了
Reason number six. I think you just lied.

320
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,900
我认为你刚为了逃避某些事而撒谎
I think you just lied to avoid something.

321
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,760
你不喜欢这番对话
You don't like this conversation.

322
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,920
肖恩  我很抱歉
Shaun, n-- Shaun, I'm sorry.

323
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:53,140
我只是有点分心
I'm just -- just a little distracted.

324
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,380
我的那位动脉瘤病人
My aneurysm patient --

325
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,510
我们在给他用高血压药
We're treating him with blood-pressure meds

326
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:58,020
避免他动脉破裂
to try and avoid a rupture.

327
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:01,300
你们应该采用血管内栓塞
You should do - an endovascular embolization.

328
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,540
他并不想要
He doesn't want one.

329
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,960
会给他的大脑造成损害
It could leave him with brain damage.

330
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,110
我以为他没有意识
I thought he was unconscious.

331
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,180
是的
He is.

332
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,180
他的妻子知道他想要什么
His wife knows what he wants.

333
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,850
太令人惊讶了
It's amazing. I just --

334
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,480
我不认为我能做到像她那样
I don't think I'd be able to do that.

335
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:18,300
她牺牲了自己的幸福和未来
She's sacrificing her happiness, her future,

336
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,330
就因为她知道
just because she knows --

337
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:20,460
她在撒谎
She's lying.

338
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:21,810
她在撒谎
She's lying.

339
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:25,590
可能是由于原因四或者是
It could be either reason number four or --

340
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:27,250
不  她没有在撒谎  肖恩  她爱他
No, she's not lying, Shaun. She loves him.

341
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,270
她不爱他
She doesn't love him.

342
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,830
你都没有见过她
You haven't even met her!

343
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,110
你没见过她和他还有他们儿子一起的样子
You haven't seen what she's like with him, with their son.

344
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,650
我不善于洞悉他人
I'm not good at reading people.

345
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:36,230
-我善于  -我认为洞悉他人
- Well, I am, and - I think people-reading

346
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,760
总会包含自己的偏见
embraces personal biases.

347
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,660
我认为我们应该避免偏见
I think we should try to avoid biases.

348
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,270
了解他人的表现
Knowledge of human behavior

349
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,760
可以让我们做出有见地的  直觉的决定
can help us make - informed, intuitive decisions.

350
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:50,400
我的方法更好
My way is better.

351
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,070
基于行为之上  她是在撒谎
It's based on actions. She's lying.

352
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,020
好吧
All right.

353
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:57,300
如果你爱一个人
If you love someone,

354
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,160
你会不遗余力阻止他死去
you'll do anything to prevent their death.

355
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:09,970
这个情况
This...situation --

356
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:12,120
可能会产生利益冲突
There seems to be a conflict of interest.

357
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,550
所以我想派一个法律上的第三方
So I would like to bring in someone else from legal

358
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,590
来处理它
to handle it.

359
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,500
我同意
Yeah, I agree.

360
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,570
你是位杰出的律师  但是
You're an excellent lawyer, but --

361
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:23,710
但是什么
But what?

362
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,910
你认为这是我的问题吗
Do you think this is my problem?

363
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:27,320
这合乎情理
It's understandable.

364
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:28,940
48小时前我们才订婚
48 hours ago, we were engaged.

365
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,330
现在突然
And now, suddenly,

366
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:31,640
你就要来调查我
you're supposed to be investigating me?

367
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:32,470
是的
Yes.

368
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,550
还有更疯狂的事
And doing crazy things,

369
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,700
比如期待你会给合适的问题
like expecting you to give me complete answers

370
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,080
一个完整的答案
to appropriate questions.

371
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,570
你相信墨菲的判断而不相信我的
You were trusting Murphy's judgment over mine.

372
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:43,030
他做出的关于本人举止的判断
His judgment about my demeanor.

373
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,240
真的吗
Seriously?

374
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,330
我就问了你一个问题
I asked you a question.

375
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:47,970
你想要我完蛋
You wanted me to screw up.

376
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:49,440
你确实弄砸了
You did screw up.

377
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,430
所以又怎样
So what?

378
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:52,670
我们只要处理它就好了
So we just deal with it.

379
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:56,430
但如果你不承认你无法一直完美
But if you can't even admit that you're not always perfect,

380
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:57,990
我不完美
then I -- - I am not perfect!

381
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,790
很明显  我的人生里也犯过错
Clearly, I have made mistakes in my life.

382
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,270
但这次不是我的错
But not this time.

383
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:09,000
刺破支气管不是我的错
That punctured bronchus was not my fault.

384
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,620
护士说他的生命体征稳定
The nurse says his vital signs are stable.

385
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,420
没有变化
No change.

386
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:33,350
很好
That's good.

387
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:38,620
这是
It's...

388
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:42,060
很大的牺牲
such a great sacrifice

389
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:45,190
尊敬他的愿望到甘愿让他离开
to respect his wishes enough to let him go.

390
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:49,420
你肯定很爱你的丈夫
You must love your husband very much.

391
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,640
但是
But...

392
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:06,090
也可能会有其他的解释
there could be another explanation.

393
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:10,520
你可能是爱他到愿意让他死去
Either you love him enough to let him die...

394
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:14,300
又或者是恨他到想让他死去
or you hate him enough to let him die.

395
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,730
你根本不知道你在说什么
You don't know - what you're talking about.

396
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:24,470
这里有一个医生曾经骚扰过我
There's a doctor here who harassed me.

397
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:27,640
他让我觉得自己很脆弱并且毫无价值
He made me feel vulnerable, worthless --

398
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,750
其实我并不是这样
neither of which I am.

399
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,620
但他没有伤害过我
But he never hurt me.

400
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:40,320
我无法想象如果他伤害了我
I can't imagine how I would feel if he did,

401
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:42,610
我会做什么
what I would do,

402
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,940
我会想对他做什么
what I would want to do to him.

403
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,220
你的丈夫对你做了什么
What did your husband do to you?

404
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:55,910
他是个好父亲
He's a good father.

405
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,730
不  他不是
No, he's not.

406
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:02,100
好父亲不会伤害母亲
A good father doesn't hurt a mother.

407
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:03,530
佩顿很爱他
Payton loves him.

408
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,570
所有的原因
All the more reason --

409
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:05,290
不
No.

410
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,060
佩顿什么也不知道  他永远不能知道
Payton doesn't know anything. He never can.

411
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,960
我知道你害怕他会来找你
I know you're afraid he'll come after you,

412
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,630
但有人能够帮助你
but there are people who can help.

413
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:18,740
家庭暴力

414
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:29,640
拥有一个慈父的记忆对佩顿来说
Payton is better off with the memory of a loving father

415
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,810
比知道真相更好
than the truth.

416
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,310
让他死吧
Let him die.

417
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:51,360
甲醇造成她腹部疼痛
Methanol is causing her abdominal pain.

418
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,820
她是喝了木酒精吗
She drank wood alcohol?

419
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,320
人们能喝什么就喝什么
People drink whatever they can drink.

420
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:57,230
她是穆斯林  不愿意让我碰她
Well, she's Muslim -- Wouldn't let me touch her.

421
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:59,350
有宗教信仰的人并不对伪善免疫
Religious people aren't immune to hypocrisy.

422
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,740
甲醇的存在也可能有其他原因
There are other ways to explain the presence of methanol.

423
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,590
肝脏也会产生甲醇
It's also produced by the liver

424
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:08,230
当身体接触到腐蚀性化学物质
when the body is exposed to certain caustic chemicals.

425
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:11,540
如果被吸入  腐蚀性物质也会刺激肺部
If inhaled, caustic chemicals could also inflame the lungs.

426
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,310
腐蚀性物质还会燃烧
And caustic chemicals also burn,

427
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:15,220
这就解释了她所有症状
so it would explain all her symptoms.

428
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,130
你有没有能造成所有这些后果的
Do you happen to have a list

429
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:17,680
腐蚀性物质的清单
of which caustic chemicals do all that?

430
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,010
硫酸二甲酯
Dimethyl sulfate

431
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,680
被用于药业
It's used in - the pharmaceutical industry.

432
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,360
她是学校教师
She's a school teacher.

433
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,730
它也用于水处理  农药工业
It's also used in water treatment, industrial pesticides,

434
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:28,100
以及化学武器
and chemical weapons.

435
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:29,580
她没有理由参与到
She has no reason to be involved

436
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,740
水处理或农药工业中
with water treatment or industrial pesticides.

437
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:35,330
但她可以同时是教师和恐怖分子
But she could be a school teacher and a terrorist.

438
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,230
-所以我们该怎么办  -做手术
- So, what do we do? - The surgery.

439
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,370
我们没有得到她的同意
We don't have her consent.

440
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,920
严格意义上  我们是没有得到他的同意
Technically, the issue is we don't have his consent.

441
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,210
我们找他的妻子是因为得不到他的同意
We go to his wife because we can't get his,

442
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:54,180
猜想是她在为了他的利益最大化考虑
the assumption being that she's operating in his best interests.

443
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:55,980
但我不会让这发生
Pretty sure that's not happening here.

444
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,890
去找他的妻子  改变她的主意
Go back to the wife, get her to change her mind,

445
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,270
不然我们就上法庭
or we'll take it to court.

446
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,530
好的
Okay.

447
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,020
你看上去很烦恼
Hey, you look annoyed.

448
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:07,420
我担心我们把他送回家他会继续家暴她
I'm annoyed we're sending him home to keep abusing his wife.

449
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:09,570
她是个一流的骗子
She's a world-class liar.

450
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,360
就我们所知  她希望她的丈夫死掉
I mean, for all we know, she wants her husband dead

451
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,680
她就可以和她的普拉提教练私奔
so that she can run off with her Pilates instructor.

452
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:16,630
-我会让她同意的  -谢谢
- I'll get the consent. - Thank you.

453
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,550
她拒绝甲醇中毒的初步治疗
She refused initial treatment for methanol toxicity.

454
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:25,730
是乙醇
It's ethanol --

455
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:27,370
因为她是穆斯林  她不能使用乙醇
Because she's Muslim, she can't consume it.

456
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,110
她体内本就有酒精
She has alcohol in her system

457
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:31,170
她却不愿意将酒精输送到体内进行治疗
but won't let us put alcohol in her system to treat it,

458
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:33,140
因为她不想自己体内有酒精
because she doesn't want alcohol in her system.

459
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,380
-我们对她注射了甲  -墨菲医生
- We put her on fomepi - Dr. Murphy...

460
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:37,710
你凭此就认为她是恐怖分子
Is this part of your evidence that she's a terrorist?

461
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,130
因为她是穆斯林吗
Because she's Muslim?

462
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:41,330
有成千上万的穆斯林不是恐怖分子
There are billions of Muslims that aren't terrorists.

463
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:44,130
所以你认为她就不是恐怖分子吗
Is that part of your evidence that she's not?

464
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:46,640
我认为她是恐怖分子  因为这是最佳的解释
I think she's a terrorist because it's the easiest way

465
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,950
对于她的症状和谎言
to explain her symptoms and her lie.

466
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,350
你有办法解释吗
Do you have a way?

467
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:52,930
她出了事故  吓坏了她
She had an accident. It scared her.

468
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:56,380
也许是我们吓坏了她  也许这个地方吓坏了她
Maybe we scare her. Hell, maybe this whole place scares her.

469
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:58,270
除了犯罪活动之外
There are a lot of reasons people don't tell the truth

470
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,540
还有很多理由会导致人们不说实话
other than criminal activity.

471
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,150
别的六个理由
Six other reasons.

472
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,990
如果一个人入院的时候身上有枪伤
If a person comes in with a gunshot wound,

473
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,470
我们得上报
we have to report it.

474
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:06,790
为什么有人可能在研制化学武器
Why don't we have to report

475
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,630
我们却不必上报呢
someone who might be making chemical weapons?

476
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,290
因为毫无根据的指控是会毁掉别人的
Because unfounded accusations can destroy people's lives.

477
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:14,840
只要真相水落石出
What does it matter what people speculate

478
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,400
那人们推测什么又有什么关系呢
as long as the truth comes out?

479
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,780
因为人们在真相水落石出之前
Because people make up their minds

480
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:19,340
就已经做出了决断
before the truth comes out.

481
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:20,870
这话是从一个老打种族牌
Says the guy who played the race card

482
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:22,530
占便宜的人口中说出的
when he needed an advantage.

483
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,040
即使你说的是对的
Even if you're right,

484
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,870
当她在重症监护室的时候也并没有制造炸弹
she's not making bombs while she's in our ICU.

485
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:29,470
还有你是错的  现在  有什么消息通知我
Also, you're wrong. Now, keep me posted.

486
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:31,350
如果她在接下来的两个小时没有好转
If she's not better in the next two hours,

487
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,580
告诉我
I want to know.

488
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,490
我们需要你同意我们给你丈夫手术
We need you to consent to your husband's surgery.

489
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:51,270
我说过了  「不」
I said "No."

490
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:56,270
还有一种更好的办法  泰莎
There's a better way, Tessa.

491
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,790
离开他
Leave him.

492
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:01,870
开始新的生活
Start a new life.

493
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:09,530
我害怕
I'm afraid.

494
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:10,510
我懂
I know.

495
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:13,060
但是这...
But...this --

496
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:15,530
这不是回答
This isn't the answer.

497
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:18,840
如果你不同意
If you don't consent,

498
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,260
我们会把这个送到法院
we'll take this to the court,

499
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,950
把我们知道的都告诉法官
and we'll tell a judge what we know.

500
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:25,720
我是偷偷告诉你这些的
I told you those things in confidence.

501
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,000
你不是我的病人  你丈夫是
You are not my patient. Your husband is.

502
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,680
有两种可能
Two things will happen.

503
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,650
我们得到许可
We will get the consent,

504
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:36,680
佩顿会知道真相
and Payton will find out the truth.

505
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:41,800


506
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:41,800

总 监     夕橙

523
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:17,970
你比你想的要更坚强
You are stronger than you think you are.

524
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,220
你体内甲醇的毒性在减轻...
Your methanol toxicity is abating --

525
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,810
治疗有效果了
The treatment's working.

526
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,410
很好
Great.

527
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:48,630
你觉得我用不了多久就可以离开了吗
Do you think that I'll be able to leave soon?

528
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,100
你的所有症状都符合
All of your symptoms are consistent

529
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,490
接触硫酸二甲脂的症状
with exposure to dimethyl sulfate.

530
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:56,270
我  我从来都没听过什么硫酸二...
I -- I've never heard of dimethyl --

531
00:24:56,270 --> 00:25:00,250
硫酸二甲脂被用来做化学武器
Dimethyl sulfate is used to make chemical weapons.

532
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:10,170
我没想到这话是从你嘴里说出来的
I didn't expect this from you.

533
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:13,120
我表达了我的意见
I made a statement.

534
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,190
你不一样
You're different.

535
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:18,000
我有自闭症
I have autism.

536
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,640
你体会过人们对你有偏见的滋味
You've experienced bigotry.

537
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,530
是的
Yes.

538
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,290
你有被人拒绝服务过吗
Have...people refused to serve you?

539
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,890
你有看到过人们
Have you seen people

540
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,630
因为你
change their flight

541
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,370
更改航班吗
because of you?

542
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:38,670
你有经历过人们在你开口之前
Have people cursed you out

543
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,720
就对你恶语相向吗
before you've opened your mouth?

544
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,910
我没有偏见
I'm not prejudiced.

545
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:47,570
我有证据
I have evidence.

546
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,200
没有人有偏见
Nobody's prejudiced.

547
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,850
大家都有证据
Everybody has evidence.

548
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:56,170
而我一直都是棕色人种
And I'm always brown.

549
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:00,440
也许你没那么不同
Maybe you're not so different.

550
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,540
你在出汗
You're sweating.

551
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:10,490
出汗是说谎的一个迹象
Perspiration is a sign of dishonesty.

552
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:14,700
我的胸
My chest.

553
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,900
胸痛可能是由焦虑引起
Chest pain can be brought on by anxiety.

554
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:21,850
但这次  你是心脏病发作了
Oh, but this time, you are having a heart attack.

555
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,320
心电图  立刻
EKG, stat!

556
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:30,060
血管内皮膜缓和了急性炎症
The endothelial lining had moderate inflammation that appeared acute,

557
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:32,250
有粘膜水肿的迹象
and there was evidence of mucosal edema.

558
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:34,430
我没有做任何特别的处理
I made no extraordinary motions,

559
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,700
也没有采取任何不必要的措施
nor did I apply any unnecessary force.

560
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,950
然而支气管被刺穿了
And yet, the bronchus was punctured.

561
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,870
这是这种手术的风险
Which is a risk, albeit a small one,

562
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,300
尽管可能性不大
with this kind of procedure.

563
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:45,670
好吧...
Well...

564
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:46,840
谢谢
thank you.

565
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,400
感谢你耐心回答我的问题
I appreciate the thoroughness of your answers.

566
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,840
虽然我也不确定我都明白了...
Not sure I understood it all...

567
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,160
但是我想我已经得到我需要的了
...but I think I've got what I need.

568
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,770
我可能不该说什么
I probably shouldn't say anything,

569
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,620
但我知道你和普莱斯顿女士
but I know you and Ms. Preston

570
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,900
现在正经历一些事
are going through something right now.

571
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:02,990
那和这一点关系都没有
That really wasn't relevant.

572
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:05,540
我  我知道  我知道  只是...
I-I know. I know. It's just...

573
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:09,060
我知道她会挺过去的  但...
I know she'll get through it, but...

574
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:12,050
你处理得更好是件好事
it's good you're handling it better.

575
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:16,570
在起草合同的时候被分心是一回事
It's one thing to be distracted while drafting a contract

576
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:20,050
你所做的又是另外一回事了
and a whole other thing entirely doing what you do.

577
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,510
注入染色剂
Inject dye.

578
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:35,520
注入染色剂
Injecting dye.

579
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:40,860
挂在左脊椎动脉上
Hanging a left at the vertebral artery.

580
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:46,140
好了  撤回导线
Okay, withdrawing the guide wire.

581
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:49,860
插入白金色基体
Inserting the platinum matrix.

582
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:56,310
你知道吗  有的时候  你做了正确的事
You know, sometimes, you do the right thing

583
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,610
事情会变得更好
and things get a little better.

584
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,780
有的时候  事情依旧糟糕
And sometimes, things still suck.

585
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,670
进入动脉瘤
Entering the aneurysm.

586
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:10,320
好了
Okay.

587
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,120
血压上升
Blood pressure's spiking.

588
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:13,820
等等  为什么
Wait, why?

589
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,590
没有破裂  没有出血
There's no rupture, no bleeding,

590
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:16,750
没有中风
no stroke.

591
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:19,260
如果血压再高点  他就要中风了
If his BP goes up any higher, he will have a stroke.

592
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:22,010
我现在要停止手术了
I'm terminating the procedure.

593
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,550
立刻推20毫克拉贝洛尔
Push 20 milligrams of labetalol, stat.

594
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:34,950
在再次手术之前我们得让他稳定下来
We need to stabilize him before we can retry the procedure,

595
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:37,510
也就是说我们得弄清楚我们漏掉了什么
which means we need to figure out what we missed.

596
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:39,090
这不是我们的错
This wasn't our fault.

597
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,170
他进手术室的时候血压是稳定的
His BP was stable going in.

598
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,400
过去的六年里他一直服用钙离子阻断剂
He's been on calcium-channel blockers for the last six years.

599
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,700
我们漏掉了什么
Well, we missed something.

600
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,830
血压不会无缘无故就猛涨的
BP doesn't skyrocket for no reason.

601
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,840
做个全面检查
Run a full work-up.

602
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:55,000
为什么一个28岁的没有任何风险因素的人
Why would a 28-year-old with no risk factors

603
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:56,320
会有心脏病
have a heart attack?

604
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,560
她的心脏在燃烧
Her heart is burning.

605
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:01,810
燃烧
Burning?

606
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:03,780
因为腐蚀性化学物质
From the caustic chemical!

607
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,250
-莫菲  -穿过了她整个系统
- Murphy. - It's going through her system.

608
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:09,270
不像烧烫伤
Unlike thermal burns,

609
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:11,460
化学灼伤随着时间会越来越严重
chemical burns get worse over time.

610
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:14,510
这也解释了她的支气管为什么会穿孔
And it also explains the punctured bronchus.

611
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,750
腐蚀性化学物质使支气管壁变薄
The caustic chemical thinned the bronchial walls.

612
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,680
你没有犯错
You did not make a mistake.

613
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,480
那不是唯一的解释
That's not the only explanation.

614
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,180
但我现在就闭嘴
But I'll shut up now.

615
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,450
你觉得你有个好主意
You think you have a good idea,

616
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:26,260
但是你准备不说出来
but you're going to shut yourself up?

617
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,530
有可能是由
It could be caused by an infection

618
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:31,060
支气管穿孔导致的
from bacteria that leaked

619
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,020
细菌感染造成的
as a result of the puncture.

620
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:36,850
如果是感染的话  治疗的方式是完全相反的
The treatments are diametrically opposed --

621
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:39,290
如果是感染的话应该输注抗生素
antibiotics if it's infection,

622
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:41,460
如果是发炎的话应该输注类固醇
steroids if it's inflammation.

623
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:44,490
如果她需要抗生素  而不是类固醇
If she needs antibiotics and she needs steroids instead,

624
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,860
会抑制她的免疫系统
it will suppress her immune system,

625
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:48,100
加重感染  使她丧命
causing the infection to flourish and kill her.

626
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,680
如果她需要类固醇
If she needs steroids

627
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,420
而我们给她输注抗生素  那么...
and we give her antibiotics, then --

628
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:52,390
我明白
I get it.

629
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:54,060
我们最好是对的
We'd better be right.

630
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,090
是的
Yes.

631
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,940
先生  我们应该再找一位高级主治医生参与
Sir, I think we should bring another senior attending in

632
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:00,070
-商量这个决定  -为什么
- to consult on this decision. - Why?

633
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:02,290
因为如果肖恩是对的  你就没做错
Because if Shaun's right, you're exonerated.

634
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:03,870
如果我是对的  你可能犯了一个
And if I'm right, you may have made the mistake

635
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:05,040
可能会杀了这位女士的错误
that could kill this woman.

636
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,260
你觉得我不能保持客观
You don't think I can be objective?

637
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:10,260
我认为你非常专业...
I think you're incredibly professional --

638
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:11,510
闭嘴  杰瑞德
Shut up, Jared.

639
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:18,840
有可能是我搞砸了
It is possible that I screwed up.

640
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,560
给她输注广谱抗生素
Let's put her on broad-spectrum antibiotics.

641
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,200
你错了
You're wrong.

642
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:30,420
在你犯错的前提下做决定是个错误
Making a decision on the assumption you made a mistake is a mistake.

643
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:32,630
你很自大
You're very arrogant.

644
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:36,570
这帮你成为更好的外科医生
It helps you be a great surgeon.

645
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,740
万幸的是  我用不着你来批准
Fortunately, I don't need your approval.

646
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:54,150
我们确定了潜在的问题
We've determined what the underlying problem was.

647
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:55,960
是什么导致了你丈夫的动脉瘤破裂
What caused your husband's aneurysm to rupture

648
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,430
以及他在手术室血压下降的缘由
and why his blood pressure spiked in the O.R.

649
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,420
数据显示  他没有在服用药物
According to his labs, he hasn't been taking his meds.

650
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:03,240
据我所知  他有吃药
As far as I know, he has.

651
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,820
这不像他
I mean, that's just not like him.

652
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:07,830
我们也觉得不是他
We don't think it's like him, either.

653
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:13,400
你们觉得是我做了手脚
You think I had something to do with this?

654
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:16,850
怎么  我扔了他的药吗
That I, what, threw his meds away?

655
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,010
他会再订一些
He'd just order more.

656
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:23,610
但如果你清空了他的胶囊  并换成糖
But if you emptied his capsules and filled them with sugar --

657
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:25,530
或者更好  换成盐
or, even better, salt --

658
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:27,990
这会结束你的噩梦
It would end your nightmare.

659
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:33,320
我很愿意让他死
I was willing to let him die,

660
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,420
但我怎么可能...
but I could never --

661
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,670
如果我足够勇敢去杀他...
If I were strong enough to kill him...

662
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:57,960
有没有可能  你儿子知道得比你以为的多
Is there a chance your son knows more than you think he does?

663
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,830
她的心率是90
Her heart rate's 90.

664
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,940
这在正常范围内
That's in the normal range.

665
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:25,450
但之前是83  应该降低才对
But it was 83. It should be going down.

666
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:28,080
她其它体征都正常
All her other signs are normal.

667
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,180
你是对的  这是妥善处理
You were right. This is the proper treatment.

668
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,450
95了
95.

669
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:37,450
我要换成类固醇
I'm switching her to steroids.

670
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:39,710
如果给她注射类固醇
If we give her steroids,

671
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:42,050
那会抑制她的免疫系统
it will suppress her immune system,

672
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:43,300
导致严重感染
causing the infection to flourish...

673
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,250
我要注射40毫克甲基强的松龙
I'm going to push 40 milligrams of methylprednisolone.

674
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:46,770
进而死亡
...and she'll die.

675
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:49,160
我来承担
This is on me.

676
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:51,070
我知道
I know.

677
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,260
我们给她换成了甲基强的松龙
We switched her to methylprednisolone.

678
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:04,600
起作用了
It's working.

679
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:06,290
你错了
You were wrong.

680
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:07,770
是的  我知道了
Yeah, I got that.

681
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,770
只是治疗方案错了
Just about the treatment choice.

682
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:10,880
你在手术室里没做错
You didn't do anything wrong in the O.R.

683
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,130
别拍我马屁了
Don't kiss my ass.

684
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:15,550
杰瑞德救了她
Jared saved her life.

685
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:19,510
如果他没有迅速采取措施  她可能就死了
If he hadn't acted so quickly, she would've died,

686
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:22,080
而那是你的错
and that would've been your fault.

687
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:23,330
是的  没错
Yes, it would've.

688
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,790
你应该感谢他
You should thank him.

689
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:34,320
谢谢你  卡卢医生
Thank you, Dr. Kalu.

690
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:30,930
有什么事吗
Can I help you?

691
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:33,840
我是肖恩·莫菲医生
I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.

692
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:37,210
你是我的新邻居  34号
You're my new neighbor, number 34.

693
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:39,860
好吧
Yeah, cool.

694
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:42,560
你想进来喝瓶酒吗
You wanna come in for a beer?

695
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,470
不了
No.

696
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,510
干得不错
Nice work.

697
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:54,530
你也是
You, too.

698
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,680
功劳属于你
You can have the honors.

699
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:00,960
这是第一次  我不想告诉家人
This is the first time I'm not looking forward

700
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,200
手术进行得很顺利
to telling the family it went well.

701
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:31,530
你会没事的
You're going to be fine.

702
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:33,630
治疗见效了
The treatment worked?

703
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:37,380
第二次的见效了  第一次的差点害死你
The second one did. The first one almost killed you.

704
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:39,540
你现在还活着
The fact that you're alive right now is evidence

705
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,390
就证明你接触了硫酸二甲酯
that you were working with dimethyl sulfate.

706
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:43,940
你是恐怖分子  是不是
You're a terrorist, aren't you?

707
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:49,000
我哥哥在药厂工作
My brother works for a drug company.

708
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:52,860
他们用硫酸二甲酯来制药
They use dimethyl sulfate to make one of their medications.

709
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:53,960
他替我偷了一些
He stole some for me.

710
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:56,410
让你来做化学武器
So you could make a chemical weapon.

711
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:58,590
让我做香水
So I could make perfume.

712
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:04,180
你闻
Smell that.

713
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:18,860
很好闻
It's...beautiful.

714
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,220
但很蠢
But very stupid.

715
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,180
是啊
Yeah.

716
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:26,520
尤其当我哥哥随时可能被炒鱿鱼
Especially since my brother would get fired

717
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,920
如果有人发现这事
if anyone ever found out.

718
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:30,950
你相信她
You believe her?

719
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,860
保护某人
Protecting someone --

720
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:34,830
第三种理由
reason number three.

721
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,320
我们还好吗
So...we good?

722
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:42,210
问题是  我不确定这是否重要
Thing is, I'm not sure it really matters.

723
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:44,380
我被告知  我明年只能有三位住院医师
I've been told I can only have three residents next year.

724
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,730
这太好了
That's great.

725
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:46,730
算不上
Not really.

726
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:49,220
因为科利走了  我得接手他的
Because of Coyle's transfer, I have to take on his.

727
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:51,370
雷兹尼克
Reznick?

728
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,810
她可让人头痛
She's a pain.

729
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,380
头痛也可以转化为动力
Pain can be a hell of motivator.

730
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:57,950
祝你好运
Good luck.

731
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,450
你是对的
You were right.

732
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:10,710
你是对的  而我希望你错了
And I think you were right that I wanted you to be wrong.

733
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,520
我很抱歉
And I'm sorry.

734
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,430
你也没错
You were right, too.

735
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:21,110
我一直告诉自己  我没事  但...
I kept telling myself that I'm fine, but...

736
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,360
这很艰难
it's been hard.

737
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:26,010
让我怀疑自己
Got me second-guessing myself,

738
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,810
也许影响了我的判断
maybe affecting my judgment.

739
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:29,140
我说不好
I don't know.

740
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:33,610
如果我们这么难过  也许我们做错了
If we're hurting so bad, maybe we made a mistake.

741
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,570
不
No.

742
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,960
这只是说明我们的曾经很重要
It just means that what we had mattered.

743
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,830
不代表那是对的
Doesn't mean that it was right.

744
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:45,410
我也在想...
I've also been thinking that...

745
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:48,590
自大让我成为了更好的外科医生
arrogance does make me a better surgeon.

746
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,780
但不会让我成为更好的丈夫
But it's not gonna make me a better husband.

747
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:57,060
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

748
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:10,890
克丽丝汀吗
Kristin?

749
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,230
我是克莱尔
I'm Claire.

750
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:16,000
谢谢你
Thanks.

751
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,540
我在调查科利医生
I am doing some research on Dr. Coyle --

752
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:29,440
调查和他共事但辞职的女人
on the women who worked with him and then quit.

753
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,720
我接到了市区交通的工作邀请
I got another offer at SF Muni.

754
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,480
我被科利医生骚扰了
I was harassed by Dr. Coyle.

755
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:42,550
我觉得你也是
And I think you were, too.

756
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,300
做正确的事  能让事情变得更好
Doing the right thing can make things a little better...

757
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,890
尤其当我们一起做的时候
especially if we do it together.

758
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:26,860
我有新邻居了
I have a new neighbor.

759
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:31,610
这么说莉亚真的走了
So, Lea's really gone, huh?

760
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:35,240
我们明天能一起吃早餐吗
So, can we have breakfast tomorrow?

761
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:39,340
我很想去  肖恩  但是...
I'd love to, Shaun, but...

762
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:44,200
我们...
we...

763
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,920
我们谈过了
We talked about this, right?

764
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:51,410
我说了如果你留下  我不会继续紧逼
I-I said that I would back off if you stayed, right?

765
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:52,410
给你更多空间  不再试图当你的父亲
More space, less "Fathering."

766
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:53,940
我不需要父亲
I don't need a father.

767
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,650
我讨厌父亲
I hate fathers.

768
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:56,510
是的  所以...
Right, so --

769
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:58,450
我需要朋友
I need a friend.

770
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:08,630
肖恩  我忍不住会给他人建议  你明白吗
Shaun, I-I am someone who can't help but give advice, you know?

771
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:12,170
我不知道自己能否做到
I don't know if I can not do that.

772
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:18,880
所以你觉得我能改变  但你不能
So you think I can change and you can't?

773
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:23,850
我觉得我们的关系很特殊
I think that we have a certain kind of relationship.

774
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,510
如果我们愿意  可以将之称其为其它的
And we can call it something different if we want,

775
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:29,490
但我们无法改变它
but we can't magically make it different.

776
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:31,410
你说了你想要空间
You said that you wanted space.

777
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:33,190
你说你需要空间
You said that you needed space.

778
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:43,520
我觉得你应该当我的朋友
I-I think you should be my friend.

779
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,500
肖恩
Shaun...

780
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:07,280
好的
Okay.

781
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:12,220
肖恩
Shaun?

782
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:22,220
BGM: Broken by Patrick Watson

783
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:18,670
? Do you feel a little broken? ?

784
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:24,710
? Do you feel a little broken? ?

785
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:31,560
? Do you feel a little broken? ?

786
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:38,910
? Do you feel a little bro-o-ken? ?

787
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:44,300
? Memories come and they go ?

788
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:51,650
? You just learn to let go ?

789
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:58,050
? Sometimes, sometimes, you wanna, wanna go back ?

790
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,380
你现在闻到什么了
What are you smelling right now?

791
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:05,260
松树
Pine trees.

792
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:10,700
? Do you feel a little broken? ?

793
00:42:11,850 --> 00:42:19,100
? Do you feel a little broken? ?
