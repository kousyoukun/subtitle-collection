1
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,390
- I was late! - It's okay, sweetie. It's not your fault.

2
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:37,020
I just wanted to play one more game at Gary's.

3
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,480
Well, you did great. You called 911 right away.

4
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,230
- He looked dead. - Daddy's not dead.

5
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:42,740
He's gonna be okay, right?

6
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,470
- He had a stroke. - That's not possible!

7
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:46,350
Well, the CT confirmed a ruptured aneurysm.

8
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:47,860
We have to operate to clip the bleeding

9
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:48,830
and reduce intracranial pressure.

10
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:50,680
No, he had a stroke six years ago.

11
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,250
They put him on diltiazem.

12
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,610
We're gonna take good care of your dad.

13
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,710
Naja Modi -- 28 years old, suffered a burn to her left hand

14
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,840
as a result of a cooking accident.

15
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,890
Are Jared and I being punished?

16
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:10,950
This is not a very interesting case, is it?

17
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:12,040
Lesson one --

18
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,480
Don't suggest to the the head of surgery

19
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,660
that working with the head of surgery

20
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:17,920
is form of punishment.

21
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,730
Dr. Melendez is very unhappy with Jared

22
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:23,410
for how he got his job back.

23
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:26,890
And Dr. Melendez is unhappy with me for t-taking --

24
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:28,440
taking two days off.

25
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,140
I don't think he wants to talk about this, Shaun.

26
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:36,750
I was an idiot.

27
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,450
It's on the stove. Of course it's hot, right?

28
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,870
You wouldn't believe how often we see these types of accidents.

29
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:43,750
Well, there are a lot of idiots.

30
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,720
Okay, what do we need to do here, Murphy?

31
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,410
A superficial partial-thickness burn

32
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:50,070
should be managed conservatively.

33
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,220
Cleanse the area, debride with soft gauze,

34
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,770
and then cover with an antimicrobial petroleum dressing.

35
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:56,890
All of which means,

36
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:59,050
this should heal with minimal scarring.

37
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,380
Naja, are you having chest pain?

38
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,260
I think I'm having a heart attack.

39
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,510
It's hard to breathe.

40
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:07,240
Just relax if you can.

41
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,210
Put her on oxygen, a 12 lead EKG,

42
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:11,510
and order a portable chest X-ray.

43
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:12,540
Murphy, let's move. Come on.

44
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,920
Her vitals are stable.

45
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:18,680
What the hell is going on here?

46
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,980
I don't know.

47
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,430
But it is interesting.

48
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,030
We've got a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Suction.

49
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:39,850
I need to isolate the aneurysm.

50
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,530
Poor kid.

51
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,900
Imagine finding your dad like that.

52
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:47,140
Well, that's exactly how I want to die.

53
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,310
If the dad doesn't make it,

54
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,160
the kid will always remember that moment --

55
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,340
be traumatized by it.

56
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,470
Because he loves him.

57
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,190
The idea of dying without anybody getting hurt --

58
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:00,000
There's nothing sadder than an empty waiting room.

59
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,370
Okay, what do you see?

60
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,510
A bulge on the anterior communicating artery.

61
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:09,460
Yeah, the ruptured aneurysm is compromising

62
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,950
blood flow to the frontal lobe.

63
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,110
Prep an 11 millimeter standard clip.

64
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:14,560
Are you married?

65
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,660
Not anymore.

66
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,310
Turns out he had even worse judgment than I did.

67
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:21,380
Oh, speaking of creeps, you hear Coyle got transferred?

68
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:23,550
I'm so glad they shut him down.

69
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,010
Well, yeah, I guess.

70
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:28,440
Just wish they'd spent the money on a Pediatric Trauma Pod.

71
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,330
They gave him a raise.

72
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:34,910
Clip.

73
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,310
The EKG confirmed

74
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,100
you weren't having a heart attack.

75
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,570
I-I wasn't faking.

76
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:42,820
I wouldn't do that.

77
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:43,720
We know.

78
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,300
The imaging also confirmed

79
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,120
that you have considerable lung inflammation.

80
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,630
Is it possible you inhaled smoke?

81
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,250
I guess I must have.

82
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,380
There was a minor grease fire.

83
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:53,360
What happens now?

84
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,910
You need a bronchoscopy.

85
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:57,280
We put a camera down your throat to see how much damage there is

86
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,810
and what we need to do to repair it.

87
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,030
But don't worry. You'll be sedated.

88
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:01,930
Please don't.

89
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:03,500
Oh, I'm -- I'm sorry.

90
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,290
The test is absolutely necessary.

91
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:06,550
The test is fine.

92
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,570
But, um...

93
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:10,540
please don't touch me, except for medical purposes.

94
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,540
Yeah, of course.

95
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,280
That does not make sense.

96
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,110
A number of religions have rules about touching.

97
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,060
I don't quite get it, but --

98
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,440
That makes sense.

99
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,990
People shouldn't touch people

100
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:28,900
unless there's a very good reason.

101
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,750
Okay, then...

102
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,010
what doesn't make sense?

103
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,690
The grease fire.

104
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:37,050
The grease fire explains the whole thing --

105
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,390
the burn, the smoke.

106
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:42,020
She told us she forgot the stove was hot.

107
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,680
How can you forget something's hot

108
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,140
when it is on fire?

109
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,790
Shaun, I'm sure we would have heard more of the story

110
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,900
if she hadn't suddenly thought she was having a heart attack.

111
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:57,660
Why didn't you fire him?

112
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:59,400
Because his story was different than yours.

113
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,720
And you believe his story?

114
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,590
I believe your story.

115
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,640
But you can't prove it.

116
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,210
And we simply can't make a policy

117
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:10,890
of believing every woman who files a complaint against every man.

118
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,720
After a few thousand years of doing the opposite,

119
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,530
it wouldn't kill us to overcorrect.

120
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,210
And the fact that - your boyfriend assaulted him

121
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,240
took away any leverage I had.

122
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,790
I did what I could.

123
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,770
I got him to take a position

124
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:27,610
where he has very little contact with staff, with patients --

125
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:28,760
outreach chair.

126
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,410
And it's a lousy assignment.

127
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,090
Sooner or later, he's gonna quit.

128
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,360
And get a job somewhere else.

129
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,750
If you have any better ideas...

130
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:40,650
I look forward to hearing them.

131
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,390
You're very lucky.

132
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:58,220
The aneurysm was in a small communicating artery.

133
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:01,200
We were able to restore blood flow to the impacted brain areas.

134
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,210
He's gonna be okay.

135
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,200
Thank God.

136
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:11,330
Is this what life is gonna be like from now on?

137
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:14,250
A-are these things just going to keep happening?

138
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:17,600
We're gonna keep him here for a few days, do some follow-up testing,

139
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,120
make some adjustments to his medications.

140
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,880
Hopefully, we'll find out why this happened.

141
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:26,550
I have to go.

142
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:30,540
Another one?

143
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:33,240
Post-operative imaging showed a 26-millimeter aneurysm

144
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,740
in the basilar artery.

145
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,440
That size and location, we're looking at a high risk of rupture.

146
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,270
He must have a genetic predisposition --

147
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,230
maybe a connective tissue disease?

148
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:42,960
All academic till we repair it.

149
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:48,140
Through the pharynx and over - to Grandmother's house we go.

150
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:51,020
There's the epiglottis and the vocal cords.

151
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:54,200
I know you're not happy that I sued the hospital.

152
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,340
But I'm not gonna apologize for that.

153
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,900
That makes it simple.

154
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:00,290
I did it because I want to be here.

155
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,280
I believe I can learn a lot from you, even from your doghouse.

156
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:05,930
I just hope you give me a chance, sir.

157
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,860
There's the carina.

158
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,350
Gonna pass into the mainstem bronchus of the left lung.

159
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:14,730
Is breaking up with your fianc¨¦e traumatic?

160
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,230
When I saw a woman get shot,

161
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,960
everyone told me it was traumatic

162
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,750
and that I should be going home.

163
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,410
Should you be going home?

164
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:29,700
Give me a mucosal brush for a cellular sample.

165
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,520
Loading it now.

166
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,480
How long does it take to get over a breakup

167
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,810
with the woman you love?

168
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:37,480
I'm seeing a lot of inflammation,

169
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,940
but no smoke damage.

170
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,850
That makes se-sense.

171
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,760
I thought we were doing this because she inhaled smoke.

172
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,870
She said she inhaled smoke.

173
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,590
I didn't believe her.

174
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:49,230
Whatever the cause, the inflammation and the damage are real.

175
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,890
Let's get a mucosal biopsy.

176
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,140
I move down here, we --

177
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:55,630
The scope breached her bronchial wall.

178
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:56,640
She's hemorrhaging.

179
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,930
- This is bad. - Prep the O.R.!

180
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:01,570
Type and cross two units of blood. We've gotta move!

181
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:05,760
We know there was a burn.

182
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:08,100
Was it something related to the grease fire,

183
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:10,030
or separate coincidental injury?

184
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:18,280
You don't have a theory, or are you refusing to talk to Jared?

185
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,660
I didn't answer because it doesn't matter

186
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,020
until we can repair this puncture

187
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,790
before bacteria passes through and spreads an infection.

188
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,830
That's true.

189
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,080
Cut this suture.

190
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,370
Let's approximate the edges with forceps.

191
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:30,520
Are you and Jared even now?

192
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,620
He made a mistake. So did you.

193
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,220
Exactly what mistake did I make?

194
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,660
This breach was your fault.

195
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,900
Is that traumatic?

196
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:51,730
I had breakfast by myself.

197
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,080
Where were you?

198
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:55,540
I'm sorry. Were we supposed to have breakfast this morning?

199
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,810
I had an early consult.

200
00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:00,870
Yes, we always have breakfast on Mondays.

201
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,920
We do? Every Monday.

202
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,490
Every Monday.

203
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,220
Thank you.

204
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:09,850
Well, I guess our streak has been broken then, huh?

205
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,790
If someone punctures the bronchus

206
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,140
during a routine bronchoscopy, that's a mistake, right?

207
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,810
Well, I can't imagine how it wouldn't be.

208
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:20,400
Why? What did you do, Shaun?

209
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,280
I'm wondering if I need to report Dr. Melendez.

210
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,000
Dr. Melendez did that?

211
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,130
The protocol is very clear.

212
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:29,890
I need to report it.

213
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:34,480
But I've seen how Jared is being treated.

214
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,840
Will Dr. Melendez treat me badly

215
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,180
if I report this?

216
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:41,030
He shouldn't, obviously.

217
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,890
But human nature being what...

218
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,000
Human nature?

219
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,550
Shaun, you know what?

220
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,770
You should make this decision for yourself.

221
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,640
In fact -- In fact...

222
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:01,280
you should to make - all your decisions yourself from here on in.

223
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:05,320
That's what we agreed on, right?

224
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,690
Have you considered an endovascular embolization procedure?

225
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:14,540
I have.

226
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,670
It's a little less risky,

227
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:16,820
but I haven't done as many,

228
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:19,170
so I'm not sure which way we're better off.

229
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:20,300
You want me to check the roster --

230
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,450
see if there's somebody available with more experience?

231
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,560
I would like to assist, but yes.

232
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,710
Okay, here we go.

233
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,340
No, he's not available.

234
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,970
So make him available.

235
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,230
I got a husband and father

236
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,820
who presented with two aneurysms in the last 12 hours.

237
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:38,290
I'd rather not.

238
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:40,650
This particular surgeon was recently...

239
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:42,970
transferred.

240
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,110
Not a chance.

241
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:53,500
Coyle is the best available surgeon for the job.

242
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,560
Coyle should've been fired, and if he'd been fired,

243
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,670
he wouldn't be available.

244
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:57,760
And if he wasn't available,

245
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,520
you would be the best person for the job.

246
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,470
Our ultimate duty is to the patient.

247
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:06,210
No, it's not.

248
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,460
You agree he should have been fired.

249
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,210
Of course.

250
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:12,120
Even if he was the - best doctor in this hospital,

251
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,620
he should have been fired, right?

252
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,190
Yes.

253
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,970
So some things have to matter more

254
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:18,770
than who is the most skilled.

255
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:22,130
If we forgive Coyle just because he's good at something,

256
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:23,990
what does he do next?

257
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,030
Either he matters or we matter.

258
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,600
Were you upset during the procedure?

259
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,350
Did Murphy tell you that I was "Traumatized"?

260
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,650
You think that I might have almost killed a person

261
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:45,930
because you dumped me?

262
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:48,130
The fact that you're describing it as "Me dumping you"

263
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:50,040
suggests that you are upset.

264
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,570
Look, I'm fine. You're fine.

265
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:54,920
Nobody's upset.

266
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,770
Great.

267
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,100
But you do understand

268
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,150
that I have to ask you these questions,

269
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,940
that I need a statement from you.

270
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,650
Yes.

271
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:04,890
Here's my statement --

272
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,890
"I wasn't distracted.

273
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:08,150
I didn't screw up."

274
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,420
You get all that?

275
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,820
Your bronchus was punctured during the procedure,

276
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:22,940
but it's been repaired.

277
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:25,410
How? How could that happen?

278
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,010
Why did you lie?

279
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,990
You said that you inhaled smoke,

280
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,970
but there was no evidence of smoke.

281
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,640
So, what do you gain by lying to your doctors?

282
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,720
I wasn't lying.

283
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,830
I was just...

284
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,960
confused, I guess.

285
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,380
I was in a lot of pain,

286
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,570
and it was all happening so fast.

287
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,020
My stomach!

288
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:46,010
Naja, what are you feeling?

289
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:49,140
It's really sore and... I feel like I'm going to--

290
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:51,210
Can we get some help over here? !

291
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,520
Four milligrams of ondansetron.

292
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:57,440
Airway inflammation, abdominal pain, nausea.

293
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,070
We need a full blood panel and abdominal ultrasound.

294
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:06,120
The procedure will seal off the aneurysm,

295
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,980
but there will almost certainly be some brain damage --

296
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:13,530
anything from mild visual or speech disturbances

297
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:16,600
to significant paralysis.

298
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,560
But without the surgery, he'll die.

299
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,440
No. I-I won't consent to the operation.

300
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,160
There really isn't a lot of choice here.

301
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,210
Without the operation --

302
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:40,550
After his first stroke, it --

303
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:43,630
it took him so long to recover.

304
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:49,540
It was frustrating and painful for him.

305
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,600
But he did recover.

306
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:59,610
He made it clear he'd never want to live compromised.

307
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,560
Excuse me.

308
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,970
Thank you for having breakfast with me.

309
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:19,470
My pleasure.

310
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,340
People lie a lot, don't they?

311
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:24,270
No, I-I meant it, Shaun.

312
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,080
I'm happy to spend time with you.

313
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:28,580
There are seven reasons that I've thought of.

314
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:31,080
There may even be more.

315
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,780
Do people ever lie without a reason?

316
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:35,750
No.

317
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:44,190
Reason number six. I think you just lied.

318
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,900
I think you just lied to avoid something.

319
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,760
You don't like this conversation.

320
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,920
Shaun, n-- Shaun, I'm sorry.

321
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:53,140
I'm just -- just a little distracted.

322
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,380
My aneurysm patient --

323
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,510
We're treating him with blood-pressure meds

324
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:58,020
to try and avoid a rupture.

325
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:01,300
You should do - an endovascular embolization.

326
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,540
He doesn't want one.

327
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,960
It could leave him with brain damage.

328
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,110
I thought he was unconscious.

329
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,180
He is.

330
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,180
His wife knows what he wants.

331
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,850
It's amazing. I just --

332
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,480
I don't think I'd be able to do that.

333
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:18,300
She's sacrificing her happiness, her future,

334
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,330
just because she knows --

335
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:20,460
She's lying.

336
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:21,810
She's lying.

337
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:25,590
It could be either reason number four or --

338
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:27,250
No, she's not lying, Shaun. She loves him.

339
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,270
She doesn't love him.

340
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,830
You haven't even met her!

341
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,110
You haven't seen what she's like with him, with their son.

342
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,650
I'm not good at reading people.

343
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:36,230
- Well, I am, and - I think people-reading

344
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,760
embraces personal biases.

345
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,660
I think we should try to avoid biases.

346
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,270
Knowledge of human behavior

347
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,760
can help us make - informed, intuitive decisions.

348
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:50,400
My way is better.

349
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,070
It's based on actions. She's lying.

350
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,020
All right.

351
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:57,300
If you love someone,

352
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,160
you'll do anything to prevent their death.

353
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:09,970
This...situation --

354
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:12,120
There seems to be a conflict of interest.

355
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,550
So I would like to bring in someone else from legal

356
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,590
to handle it.

357
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,500
Yeah, I agree.

358
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,570
You're an excellent lawyer, but --

359
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:23,710
But what?

360
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,910
Do you think this is my problem?

361
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:27,320
It's understandable.

362
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:28,940
48 hours ago, we were engaged.

363
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,330
And now, suddenly,

364
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:31,640
you're supposed to be investigating me?

365
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:32,470
Yes.

366
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,550
And doing crazy things,

367
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,700
like expecting you to give me complete answers

368
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,080
to appropriate questions.

369
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,570
You were trusting Murphy's judgment over mine.

370
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:43,030
His judgment about my demeanor.

371
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,240
Seriously?

372
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,330
I asked you a question.

373
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:47,970
You wanted me to screw up.

374
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:49,440
You did screw up.

375
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,430
So what?

376
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:52,670
So we just deal with it.

377
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:56,430
But if you can't even admit that you're not always perfect,

378
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:57,990
then I -- - I am not perfect!

379
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,790
Clearly, I have made mistakes in my life.

380
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,270
But not this time.

381
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:09,000
That punctured bronchus was not my fault.

382
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,620
The nurse says his vital signs are stable.

383
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,420
No change.

384
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:33,350
That's good.

385
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:38,620
It's...

386
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:42,060
such a great sacrifice

387
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:45,190
to respect his wishes enough to let him go.

388
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:49,420
You must love your husband very much.

389
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,640
But...

390
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:06,090
there could be another explanation.

391
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:10,520
Either you love him enough to let him die...

392
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:14,300
or you hate him enough to let him die.

393
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,730
You don't know - what you're talking about.

394
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:24,470
There's a doctor here who harassed me.

395
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:27,640
He made me feel vulnerable, worthless --

396
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,750
neither of which I am.

397
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,620
But he never hurt me.

398
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:40,320
I can't imagine how I would feel if he did,

399
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:42,610
what I would do,

400
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,940
what I would want to do to him.

401
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,220
What did your husband do to you?

402
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:55,910
He's a good father.

403
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,730
No, he's not.

404
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:02,100
A good father doesn't hurt a mother.

405
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:03,530
Payton loves him.

406
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,570
All the more reason --

407
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:05,290
No.

408
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,060
Payton doesn't know anything. He never can.

409
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,960
I know you're afraid he'll come after you,

410
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,630
but there are people who can help.

411
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:29,640
Payton is better off with the memory of a loving father

412
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,810
than the truth.

413
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,310
Let him die.

414
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:51,360
Methanol is causing her abdominal pain.

415
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,820
She drank wood alcohol?

416
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,320
People drink whatever they can drink.

417
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:57,230
Well, she's Muslim -- Wouldn't let me touch her.

418
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:59,350
Religious people aren't immune to hypocrisy.

419
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,740
There are other ways to explain the presence of methanol.

420
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,590
It's also produced by the liver

421
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:08,230
when the body is exposed to certain caustic chemicals.

422
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:11,540
If inhaled, caustic chemicals could also inflame the lungs.

423
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,310
And caustic chemicals also burn,

424
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:15,220
so it would explain all her symptoms.

425
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,130
Do you happen to have a list

426
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:17,680
of which caustic chemicals do all that?

427
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,010
Dimethyl sulfate

428
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,680
It's used in - the pharmaceutical industry.

429
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,360
She's a school teacher.

430
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,730
It's also used in water treatment, industrial pesticides,

431
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:28,100
and chemical weapons.

432
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:29,580
She has no reason to be involved

433
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,740
with water treatment or industrial pesticides.

434
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:35,330
But she could be a school teacher and a terrorist.

435
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,230
- So, what do we do? - The surgery.

436
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,370
We don't have her consent.

437
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,920
Technically, the issue is we don't have his consent.

438
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,210
We go to his wife because we can't get his,

439
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:54,180
the assumption being that she's operating in his best interests.

440
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:55,980
Pretty sure that's not happening here.

441
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,890
Go back to the wife, get her to change her mind,

442
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,270
or we'll take it to court.

443
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,530
Okay.

444
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,020
Hey, you look annoyed.

445
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:07,420
I'm annoyed we're sending him home to keep abusing his wife.

446
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:09,570
She's a world-class liar.

447
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,360
I mean, for all we know, she wants her husband dead

448
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,680
so that she can run off with her Pilates instructor.

449
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:16,630
- I'll get the consent. - Thank you.

450
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,550
She refused initial treatment for methanol toxicity.

451
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:25,730
It's ethanol --

452
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:27,370
Because she's Muslim, she can't consume it.

453
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,110
She has alcohol in her system

454
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:31,170
but won't let us put alcohol in her system to treat it,

455
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:33,140
because she doesn't want alcohol in her system.

456
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,380
- We put her on fomepi - Dr. Murphy...

457
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:37,710
Is this part of your evidence that she's a terrorist?

458
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,130
Because she's Muslim?

459
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:41,330
There are billions of Muslims that aren't terrorists.

460
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:44,130
Is that part of your evidence that she's not?

461
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:46,640
I think she's a terrorist because it's the easiest way

462
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,950
to explain her symptoms and her lie.

463
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,350
Do you have a way?

464
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:52,930
She had an accident. It scared her.

465
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:56,380
Maybe we scare her. Hell, maybe this whole place scares her.

466
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:58,270
There are a lot of reasons people don't tell the truth

467
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,540
other than criminal activity.

468
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,150
Six other reasons.

469
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,990
If a person comes in with a gunshot wound,

470
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,470
we have to report it.

471
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:06,790
Why don't we have to report

472
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,630
someone who might be making chemical weapons?

473
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,290
Because unfounded accusations can destroy people's lives.

474
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:14,840
What does it matter what people speculate

475
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,400
as long as the truth comes out?

476
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,780
Because people make up their minds

477
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:19,340
before the truth comes out.

478
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:20,870
Says the guy who played the race card

479
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:22,530
when he needed an advantage.

480
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,040
Even if you're right,

481
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,870
she's not making bombs while she's in our ICU.

482
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:29,470
Also, you're wrong. Now, keep me posted.

483
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:31,350
If she's not better in the next two hours,

484
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,580
I want to know.

485
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,490
We need you to consent to your husband's surgery.

486
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:51,270
I said "No."

487
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:56,270
There's a better way, Tessa.

488
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,790
Leave him.

489
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:01,870
Start a new life.

490
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:09,530
I'm afraid.

491
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:10,510
I know.

492
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:13,060
But...this --

493
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:15,530
This isn't the answer.

494
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:18,840
If you don't consent,

495
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,260
we'll take this to the court,

496
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,950
and we'll tell a judge what we know.

497
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:25,720
I told you those things in confidence.

498
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,000
You are not my patient. Your husband is.

499
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,680
Two things will happen.

500
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,650
We will get the consent,

501
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:36,680
and Payton will find out the truth.

502
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,490
Tessa?

503
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:17,970
You are stronger than you think you are.

504
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,220
Your methanol toxicity is abating --

505
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,810
The treatment's working.

506
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,410
Great.

507
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:48,630
Do you think that I'll be able to leave soon?

508
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,100
All of your symptoms are consistent

509
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,490
with exposure to dimethyl sulfate.

510
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:56,270
I -- I've never heard of dimethyl --

511
00:24:56,270 --> 00:25:00,250
Dimethyl sulfate is used to make chemical weapons.

512
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:10,170
I didn't expect this from you.

513
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:13,120
I made a statement.

514
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,190
You're different.

515
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:18,000
I have autism.

516
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,640
You've experienced bigotry.

517
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,530
Yes.

518
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,290
Have...people refused to serve you?

519
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,890
Have you seen people

520
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,630
change their flight

521
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,370
because of you?

522
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:38,670
Have people cursed you out

523
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,720
before you've opened your mouth?

524
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,910
I'm not prejudiced.

525
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:47,570
I have evidence.

526
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,200
Nobody's prejudiced.

527
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,850
Everybody has evidence.

528
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:56,170
And I'm always brown.

529
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:00,440
Maybe you're not so different.

530
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,540
You're sweating.

531
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:10,490
Perspiration is a sign of dishonesty.

532
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:14,700
My chest.

533
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,900
Chest pain can be brought on by anxiety.

534
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:21,850
Oh, but this time, you are having a heart attack.

535
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,320
EKG, stat!

536
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:30,060
The endothelial lining had moderate inflammation that appeared acute,

537
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:32,250
and there was evidence of mucosal edema.

538
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:34,430
I made no extraordinary motions,

539
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,700
nor did I apply any unnecessary force.

540
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,950
And yet, the bronchus was punctured.

541
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,870
Which is a risk, albeit a small one,

542
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,300
with this kind of procedure.

543
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:45,670
Well...

544
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:46,840
thank you.

545
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,400
I appreciate the thoroughness of your answers.

546
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,840
Not sure I understood it all...

547
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,160
...but I think I've got what I need.

548
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,770
I probably shouldn't say anything,

549
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,620
but I know you and Ms. Preston

550
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,900
are going through something right now.

551
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:02,990
That really wasn't relevant.

552
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:05,540
I-I know. I know. It's just...

553
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:09,060
I know she'll get through it, but...

554
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:12,050
it's good you're handling it better.

555
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:16,570
It's one thing to be distracted while drafting a contract

556
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:20,050
and a whole other thing entirely doing what you do.

557
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,510
Inject dye.

558
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:35,520
Injecting dye.

559
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:40,860
Hanging a left at the vertebral artery.

560
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:46,140
Okay, withdrawing the guide wire.

561
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:49,860
Inserting the platinum matrix.

562
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:56,310
You know, sometimes, you do the right thing

563
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,610
and things get a little better.

564
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,780
And sometimes, things still suck.

565
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,670
Entering the aneurysm.

566
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:10,320
Okay.

567
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,120
Blood pressure's spiking.

568
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:13,820
Wait, why?

569
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,590
There's no rupture, no bleeding,

570
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:16,750
no stroke.

571
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:19,260
If his BP goes up any higher, he will have a stroke.

572
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:22,010
I'm terminating the procedure.

573
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,550
Push 20 milligrams of labetalol, stat.

574
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:34,950
We need to stabilize him before we can retry the procedure,

575
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:37,510
which means we need to figure out what we missed.

576
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:39,090
This wasn't our fault.

577
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,170
His BP was stable going in.

578
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,400
He's been on calcium-channel blockers for the last six years.

579
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,700
Well, we missed something.

580
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,830
BP doesn't skyrocket for no reason.

581
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,840
Run a full work-up.

582
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:55,000
Why would a 28-year-old with no risk factors

583
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:56,320
have a heart attack?

584
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,560
Her heart is burning.

585
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:01,810
Burning?

586
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:03,780
From the caustic chemical!

587
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,250
- Murphy. - It's going through her system.

588
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:09,270
Unlike thermal burns,

589
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:11,460
chemical burns get worse over time.

590
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:14,510
And it also explains the punctured bronchus.

591
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,750
The caustic chemical thinned the bronchial walls.

592
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,680
You did not make a mistake.

593
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,480
That's not the only explanation.

594
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,180
But I'll shut up now.

595
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,450
You think you have a good idea,

596
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:26,260
but you're going to shut yourself up?

597
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,530
It could be caused by an infection

598
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:31,060
from bacteria that leaked

599
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,020
as a result of the puncture.

600
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:36,850
The treatments are diametrically opposed --

601
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:39,290
antibiotics if it's infection,

602
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:41,460
steroids if it's inflammation.

603
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:44,490
If she needs antibiotics and she needs steroids instead,

604
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,860
it will suppress her immune system,

605
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:48,100
causing the infection to flourish and kill her.

606
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,680
If she needs steroids

607
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,420
and we give her antibiotics, then --

608
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:52,390
I get it.

609
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:54,060
We'd better be right.

610
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,090
Yes.

611
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,940
Sir, I think we should bring another senior attending in

612
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:00,070
- to consult on this decision. - Why?

613
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:02,290
Because if Shaun's right, you're exonerated.

614
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:03,870
And if I'm right, you may have made the mistake

615
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:05,040
that could kill this woman.

616
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,260
You don't think I can be objective?

617
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:10,260
I think you're incredibly professional --

618
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:11,510
Shut up, Jared.

619
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:18,840
It is possible that I screwed up.

620
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,560
Let's put her on broad-spectrum antibiotics.

621
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,200
You're wrong.

622
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:30,420
Making a decision on the assumption you made a mistake is a mistake.

623
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:32,630
You're very arrogant.

624
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:36,570
It helps you be a great surgeon.

625
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,740
Fortunately, I don't need your approval.

626
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:54,150
We've determined what the underlying problem was.

627
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:55,960
What caused your husband's aneurysm to rupture

628
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,430
and why his blood pressure spiked in the O.R.

629
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,420
According to his labs, he hasn't been taking his meds.

630
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:03,240
As far as I know, he has.

631
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,820
I mean, that's just not like him.

632
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:07,830
We don't think it's like him, either.

633
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:13,400
You think I had something to do with this?

634
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:16,850
That I, what, threw his meds away?

635
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,010
He'd just order more.

636
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:23,610
But if you emptied his capsules and filled them with sugar --

637
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:25,530
or, even better, salt --

638
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:27,990
It would end your nightmare.

639
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:33,320
I was willing to let him die,

640
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,420
but I could never --

641
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,670
If I were strong enough to kill him...

642
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:57,960
Is there a chance your son knows more than you think he does?

643
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,830
Her heart rate's 90.

644
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,940
That's in the normal range.

645
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:25,450
But it was 83. It should be going down.

646
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:28,080
All her other signs are normal.

647
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,180
You were right. This is the proper treatment.

648
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,450
95.

649
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:37,450
I'm switching her to steroids.

650
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:39,710
If we give her steroids,

651
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:42,050
it will suppress her immune system,

652
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:43,300
causing the infection to flourish...

653
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,250
I'm going to push 40 milligrams of methylprednisolone.

654
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:46,770
...and she'll die.

655
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:49,160
This is on me.

656
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:51,070
I know.

657
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,260
We switched her to methylprednisolone.

658
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:04,600
It's working.

659
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:06,290
You were wrong.

660
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:07,770
Yeah, I got that.

661
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,770
Just about the treatment choice.

662
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:10,880
You didn't do anything wrong in the O.R.

663
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,130
Don't kiss my ass.

664
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:15,550
Jared saved her life.

665
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:19,510
If he hadn't acted so quickly, she would've died,

666
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:22,080
and that would've been your fault.

667
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:23,330
Yes, it would've.

668
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,790
You should thank him.

669
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:34,320
Thank you, Dr. Kalu.

670
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:30,930
Can I help you?

671
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:33,840
I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.

672
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:37,210
You're my new neighbor, number 34.

673
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:39,860
Yeah, cool.

674
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:42,560
You wanna come in for a beer?

675
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,470
No.

676
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,510
Nice work.

677
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:54,530
You, too.

678
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,680
You can have the honors.

679
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:00,960
This is the first time I'm not looking forward

680
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,200
to telling the family it went well.

681
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:31,530
You're going to be fine.

682
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:33,630
The treatment worked?

683
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:37,380
The second one did. The first one almost killed you.

684
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:39,540
The fact that you're alive right now is evidence

685
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,390
that you were working with dimethyl sulfate.

686
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:43,940
You're a terrorist, aren't you?

687
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:49,000
My brother works for a drug company.

688
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:52,860
They use dimethyl sulfate to make one of their medications.

689
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:53,960
He stole some for me.

690
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:56,410
So you could make a chemical weapon.

691
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:58,590
So I could make perfume.

692
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:04,180
Smell that.

693
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:18,860
It's...beautiful.

694
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,220
But very stupid.

695
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,180
Yeah.

696
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:26,520
Especially since my brother would get fired

697
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,920
if anyone ever found out.

698
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:30,950
You believe her?

699
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,860
Protecting someone --

700
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:34,830
reason number three.

701
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,320
So...we good?

702
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:42,210
Thing is, I'm not sure it really matters.

703
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:44,380
I've been told I can only have three residents next year.

704
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,730
That's great.

705
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:46,730
Not really.

706
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:49,220
Because of Coyle's transfer, I have to take on his.

707
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:51,370
Reznick?

708
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,810
She's a pain.

709
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,380
Pain can be a hell of motivator.

710
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:57,950
Good luck.

711
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,450
You were right.

712
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:10,710
And I think you were right that I wanted you to be wrong.

713
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,520
And I'm sorry.

714
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,430
You were right, too.

715
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:21,110
I kept telling myself that I'm fine, but...

716
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,360
it's been hard.

717
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:26,010
Got me second-guessing myself,

718
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,810
maybe affecting my judgment.

719
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:29,140
I don't know.

720
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:33,610
If we're hurting so bad, maybe we made a mistake.

721
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,570
No.

722
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,960
It just means that what we had mattered.

723
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,830
Doesn't mean that it was right.

724
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:45,410
I've also been thinking that...

725
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:48,590
arrogance does make me a better surgeon.

726
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,780
But it's not gonna make me a better husband.

727
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:57,060
I'm sorry.

728
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:10,890
Kristin?

729
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,230
I'm Claire.

730
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:16,000
Thanks.

731
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,540
I am doing some research on Dr. Coyle --

732
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:29,440
on the women who worked with him and then quit.

733
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,720
I got another offer at SF Muni.

734
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,480
I was harassed by Dr. Coyle.

735
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:42,550
And I think you were, too.

736
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,300
Doing the right thing can make things a little better...

737
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,890
especially if we do it together.

738
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:26,860
I have a new neighbor.

739
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:31,610
So, Lea's really gone, huh?

740
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:35,240
So, can we have breakfast tomorrow?

741
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:39,340
I'd love to, Shaun, but...

742
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:44,200
we...

743
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,920
We talked about this, right?

744
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:51,410
I-I said that I would back off if you stayed, right?

745
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:52,410
More space, less "Fathering."

746
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:53,940
I don't need a father.

747
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,650
I hate fathers.

748
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:56,510
Right, so --

749
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:58,450
I need a friend.

750
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:08,630
Shaun, I-I am someone who can't help but give advice, you know?

751
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:12,170
I don't know if I can not do that.

752
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:18,880
So you think I can change and you can't?

753
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:23,850
I think that we have a certain kind of relationship.

754
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,510
And we can call it something different if we want,

755
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:29,490
but we can't magically make it different.

756
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:31,410
You said that you wanted space.

757
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:33,190
You said that you needed space.

758
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:43,520
I-I think you should be my friend.

759
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,500
Shaun...

760
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:07,280
Okay.

761
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:12,220
Shaun?

762
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:22,220
