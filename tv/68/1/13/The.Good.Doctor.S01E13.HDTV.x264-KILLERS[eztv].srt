1
00:00:32,028 --> 00:00:34,333
- I was late!
- It's okay, sweetie. It's not your fault.

2
00:00:34,364 --> 00:00:36,197
I just wanted to play
one more game at Gary's.

3
00:00:36,199 --> 00:00:38,533
Well, you did great.
You called 911 right away.

4
00:00:38,535 --> 00:00:40,301
- He looked dead.
- Daddy's not dead.

5
00:00:40,303 --> 00:00:41,769
He's gonna be okay, right?

6
00:00:41,771 --> 00:00:43,504
- He had a stroke.
- That's not possible!

7
00:00:43,506 --> 00:00:45,506
Well, the CT confirmed
a ruptured aneurysm.

8
00:00:45,508 --> 00:00:46,908
We have to operate to clip the bleeding

9
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:48,276
and reduce intracranial pressure.

10
00:00:48,278 --> 00:00:49,811
No, he had a stroke six years ago.

11
00:00:49,813 --> 00:00:51,717
They put him on diltiazem.

12
00:00:52,076 --> 00:00:53,576
We're gonna take good care of your dad.

13
00:00:56,547 --> 00:00:59,949
Naja Modi... 28 years old,
suffered a burn to her left hand

14
00:00:59,951 --> 00:01:01,918
as a result of a cooking accident.

15
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,254
Are Jared and I being punished?

16
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:10,259
This is not a very
interesting case, is it?

17
00:01:10,261 --> 00:01:11,694
Lesson one...

18
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:13,663
Don't suggest to the the head of surgery

19
00:01:13,665 --> 00:01:15,398
that working <i>with the head of surgery</i>

20
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,799
is form of punishment.

21
00:01:16,801 --> 00:01:20,770
Dr. Melendez is very unhappy with Jared

22
00:01:20,772 --> 00:01:22,805
for how he got his job back.

23
00:01:22,807 --> 00:01:25,875
And Dr. Melendez is unhappy
with me for t-taking...

24
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:27,576
taking two days off.

25
00:01:27,578 --> 00:01:31,013
I don't think he wants to talk
about this, Shaun.

26
00:01:34,752 --> 00:01:36,218
I was an idiot.

27
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:38,621
It's on the stove.
Of course it's hot, right?

28
00:01:38,623 --> 00:01:41,123
You wouldn't believe how often
we see these types of accidents.

29
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:42,892
Well, there are a lot of idiots.

30
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:45,161
Okay, what do we need
to do here, Murphy?

31
00:01:45,163 --> 00:01:47,663
A superficial partial-thickness burn

32
00:01:47,665 --> 00:01:49,231
should be managed conservatively.

33
00:01:49,233 --> 00:01:51,267
Cleanse the area,
debride with soft gauze,

34
00:01:51,269 --> 00:01:53,703
and then cover with an antimicrobial

35
00:01:53,705 --> 00:01:54,870
petroleum dressing.

36
00:01:54,872 --> 00:01:56,038
All of which means,

37
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,541
this should heal with minimal scarring.

38
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:01,978
Naja, are you having chest pain?

39
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,679
I think I'm having a heart attack.

40
00:02:03,681 --> 00:02:04,947
It's hard to breathe.

41
00:02:04,949 --> 00:02:07,450
Just relax if you can.

42
00:02:07,452 --> 00:02:09,218
Put her on oxygen, a 12 lead EKG,

43
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,653
and order a portable chest X-ray.

44
00:02:10,655 --> 00:02:14,156
- Murphy, let's move. Come on.
- Her vitals are stable.

45
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:17,727
What the hell is going on here?

46
00:02:17,729 --> 00:02:19,695
I don't know.

47
00:02:19,697 --> 00:02:22,285
But it <i>is</i> interesting.

48
00:02:22,348 --> 00:02:27,362
<font color="#0080ff">Synced & corrected by</font> kinglouisxx

49
00:02:35,145 --> 00:02:37,246
We've got a subarachnoid
hemorrhage. Suction.

50
00:02:37,248 --> 00:02:39,482
I need to isolate the aneurysm.

51
00:02:39,484 --> 00:02:41,684
Poor kid.

52
00:02:41,686 --> 00:02:44,153
Imagine finding your dad like that.

53
00:02:44,155 --> 00:02:46,489
Well, that's exactly how I want to die.

54
00:02:48,292 --> 00:02:49,392
If the dad doesn't make it,

55
00:02:49,394 --> 00:02:51,293
the kid will always remember
that moment...

56
00:02:51,295 --> 00:02:52,561
be traumatized by it.

57
00:02:52,563 --> 00:02:54,063
Because he loves him.

58
00:02:54,065 --> 00:02:56,599
The idea of dying without
anybody getting hurt...

59
00:02:56,601 --> 00:02:59,201
There's nothing sadder than
an empty waiting room.

60
00:03:02,072 --> 00:03:04,206
Okay, what do you see?

61
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:06,809
A bulge on the anterior
communicating artery.

62
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:08,611
Yeah, the ruptured aneurysm
is compromising

63
00:03:08,613 --> 00:03:10,079
blood flow to the frontal lobe.

64
00:03:10,081 --> 00:03:12,248
Prep an 11 millimeter standard clip.

65
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,916
Are you married?

66
00:03:13,918 --> 00:03:15,351
Not anymore.

67
00:03:15,353 --> 00:03:17,987
Turns out he had even worse
judgment than I did.

68
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:20,289
Oh, speaking of creeps,
you hear Coyle got transferred?

69
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:22,658
I'm so glad they shut him down.

70
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,894
Well, yeah, I guess.

71
00:03:24,896 --> 00:03:27,696
Just wish they'd spent the money
on a Pediatric Trauma Pod.

72
00:03:29,967 --> 00:03:33,302
They gave him a raise.

73
00:03:33,304 --> 00:03:35,738
Clip.

74
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,540
The EKG confirmed

75
00:03:37,542 --> 00:03:39,208
you weren't having a heart attack.

76
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:41,110
I-I wasn't faking.

77
00:03:41,112 --> 00:03:43,379
- I wouldn't do that.
- We know.

78
00:03:43,381 --> 00:03:44,513
The imaging also confirmed

79
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:46,248
that you have considerable
lung inflammation.

80
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,716
Is it possible you inhaled smoke?

81
00:03:47,718 --> 00:03:49,251
I guess I must have.

82
00:03:49,253 --> 00:03:51,620
There was a minor grease fire.

83
00:03:51,622 --> 00:03:54,423
- What happens now?
- You need a bronchoscopy.

84
00:03:54,425 --> 00:03:56,559
We put a camera down your throat
to see how much damage there is

85
00:03:56,561 --> 00:03:58,260
and what we need to do to repair it.

86
00:03:58,262 --> 00:04:00,196
But don't worry. You'll be sedated.

87
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,330
Please don't.

88
00:04:01,332 --> 00:04:02,765
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.

89
00:04:02,767 --> 00:04:04,333
The test is absolutely necessary.

90
00:04:04,335 --> 00:04:05,601
The test is fine.

91
00:04:05,603 --> 00:04:06,836
But, um...

92
00:04:06,838 --> 00:04:09,505
please don't touch me,
except for medical purposes.

93
00:04:09,507 --> 00:04:11,173
Yeah, of course.

94
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:20,282
That does not make sense.

95
00:04:20,284 --> 00:04:22,251
A number of religions have rules
about touching.

96
00:04:22,253 --> 00:04:23,452
I don't quite get it, but...

97
00:04:23,454 --> 00:04:24,620
That makes sense.

98
00:04:24,622 --> 00:04:26,122
People shouldn't touch people

99
00:04:26,124 --> 00:04:27,823
unless there's a very good reason.

100
00:04:27,825 --> 00:04:29,859
Okay, then...

101
00:04:29,861 --> 00:04:31,894
what doesn't make sense?

102
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:34,363
The grease fire.

103
00:04:34,365 --> 00:04:36,165
The grease fire explains
the whole thing...

104
00:04:36,167 --> 00:04:37,633
the burn, the smoke.

105
00:04:37,635 --> 00:04:41,070
She told us she forgot
the stove was hot.

106
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:42,805
How can you forget something's hot

107
00:04:42,807 --> 00:04:44,240
when it is on fire?

108
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,574
Shaun,

109
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:46,942
I'm sure we would have heard
more of the story

110
00:04:46,944 --> 00:04:50,513
if she hadn't suddenly thought
she was having a heart attack.

111
00:04:54,886 --> 00:04:56,919
Why didn't you fire him?

112
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:58,521
Because his story was different
than yours.

113
00:04:58,523 --> 00:05:01,323
And you believe <i>his</i> story?

114
00:05:01,325 --> 00:05:03,058
I believe <i>your</i> story.

115
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,894
But you can't prove it.

116
00:05:04,896 --> 00:05:06,629
And we simply can't make a policy

117
00:05:06,631 --> 00:05:08,964
of believing every woman
who files a complaint

118
00:05:08,966 --> 00:05:10,065
against every man.

119
00:05:12,036 --> 00:05:14,970
After a few thousand years
of doing the opposite,

120
00:05:14,972 --> 00:05:16,672
it wouldn't kill us to overcorrect.

121
00:05:16,674 --> 00:05:18,374
And the fact that
your boyfriend assaulted him

122
00:05:18,376 --> 00:05:20,442
took away any leverage I had.

123
00:05:20,444 --> 00:05:21,777
I did what I could.

124
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:23,946
I got him to take a position

125
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:26,749
where he has very little contact
with staff, with patients...

126
00:05:26,751 --> 00:05:27,816
outreach chair.

127
00:05:27,818 --> 00:05:29,652
And it's a lousy assignment.

128
00:05:29,654 --> 00:05:31,520
Sooner or later, he's gonna quit.

129
00:05:31,522 --> 00:05:33,856
And get a job somewhere else.

130
00:05:33,858 --> 00:05:37,560
If you have any better ideas...

131
00:05:37,562 --> 00:05:40,196
I look forward to hearing them.

132
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:54,710
You're very lucky.

133
00:05:54,712 --> 00:05:57,479
The aneurysm was in
a small communicating artery.

134
00:05:57,481 --> 00:05:58,914
We were able to restore blood flow

135
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:00,316
to the impacted brain areas.

136
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:01,450
He's gonna be okay.

137
00:06:01,452 --> 00:06:02,785
Thank God.

138
00:06:07,525 --> 00:06:10,459
Is this what life is gonna be
like from now on?

139
00:06:10,461 --> 00:06:13,429
A-Are these things just going
to keep happening?

140
00:06:13,431 --> 00:06:15,464
We're gonna keep him here
for a few days,

141
00:06:15,466 --> 00:06:16,732
do some follow-up testing,

142
00:06:16,734 --> 00:06:19,435
make some adjustments
to his medications.

143
00:06:19,437 --> 00:06:22,037
Hopefully, we'll find out
why this happened.

144
00:06:24,709 --> 00:06:26,108
I have to go.

145
00:06:27,945 --> 00:06:29,778
Another one?

146
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:32,448
Post-operative imaging showed
a 26-millimeter aneurysm

147
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:33,682
in the basilar artery.

148
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:34,950
That size and location,

149
00:06:34,952 --> 00:06:36,552
we're looking at a high risk of rupture.

150
00:06:36,554 --> 00:06:38,087
He must have a genetic predisposition...

151
00:06:38,089 --> 00:06:40,422
maybe a connective tissue disease?

152
00:06:40,424 --> 00:06:43,792
All academic till we repair it.

153
00:06:43,794 --> 00:06:44,927
Through the pharynx

154
00:06:44,929 --> 00:06:47,296
and over to Grandmother's house we go.

155
00:06:47,298 --> 00:06:50,760
There's the epiglottis
and the vocal cords.

156
00:06:51,469 --> 00:06:53,836
I know you're not happy that
I sued the hospital.

157
00:06:53,838 --> 00:06:55,371
But I'm not gonna apologize for that.

158
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:57,473
That makes it simple.

159
00:06:57,475 --> 00:06:59,508
I did it because I want to be here.

160
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,043
I believe I can learn a lot from you,

161
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:03,212
even from your doghouse.

162
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:04,680
I just hope you give me a chance, sir.

163
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:08,083
There's the carina.

164
00:07:08,085 --> 00:07:10,552
Gonna pass into the mainstem
bronchus of the left lung.

165
00:07:10,554 --> 00:07:14,156
Is breaking up with your fiancée
traumatic?

166
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,428
When I saw a woman get shot,

167
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:21,096
everyone told me it was traumatic

168
00:07:21,098 --> 00:07:23,198
and that I should be going home.

169
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,402
Should <i>you be going home?</i>

170
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,437
Give me a mucosal brush
for a cellular sample.

171
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:29,505
Loading it now.

172
00:07:29,507 --> 00:07:31,640
How long does it take
to get over a breakup

173
00:07:31,642 --> 00:07:33,175
with the woman you love?

174
00:07:35,045 --> 00:07:36,745
I'm seeing a lot of inflammation,

175
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:38,147
but no smoke damage.

176
00:07:38,149 --> 00:07:39,948
That makes se-sense.

177
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,884
I thought we were doing this
because she inhaled smoke.

178
00:07:41,886 --> 00:07:44,053
She <i>said she inhaled smoke.</i>

179
00:07:44,055 --> 00:07:45,821
I didn't believe her.

180
00:07:45,823 --> 00:07:47,156
Whatever the cause, the inflammation

181
00:07:47,158 --> 00:07:48,290
and the damage are real.

182
00:07:48,292 --> 00:07:50,459
Let's get a mucosal biopsy.

183
00:07:50,461 --> 00:07:53,128
I move down here, we...

184
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:54,663
The scope breached her bronchial wall.

185
00:07:54,665 --> 00:07:55,898
She's hemorrhaging.

186
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,033
- This is bad.
- Prep the O.R.!

187
00:07:58,035 --> 00:08:00,740
Type and cross two units
of blood. We've gotta move!

188
00:08:02,338 --> 00:08:03,471
We know there was a burn.

189
00:08:03,607 --> 00:08:06,074
Was it something related
to the grease fire,

190
00:08:06,144 --> 00:08:07,911
or separate coincidental injury?

191
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:13,661
You don't have a theory,

192
00:08:13,724 --> 00:08:16,025
or are you refusing to talk to Jared?

193
00:08:16,027 --> 00:08:17,459
I didn't answer
because it doesn't matter

194
00:08:17,461 --> 00:08:18,861
until we can repair this puncture

195
00:08:18,863 --> 00:08:21,764
before bacteria passes through
and spreads an infection.

196
00:08:21,766 --> 00:08:22,831
That's true.

197
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:24,033
Cut this suture.

198
00:08:24,035 --> 00:08:26,301
Let's approximate the edges
with forceps.

199
00:08:26,303 --> 00:08:29,905
Are you and Jared even now?

200
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:32,274
He made a mistake. So did you.

201
00:08:32,276 --> 00:08:33,976
Exactly what mistake did I make?

202
00:08:33,978 --> 00:08:36,345
This breach was your fault.

203
00:08:37,882 --> 00:08:40,916
Is that traumatic?

204
00:08:46,956 --> 00:08:49,425
I had breakfast by myself.

205
00:08:49,427 --> 00:08:50,793
Where were you?

206
00:08:50,795 --> 00:08:53,295
I'm sorry. Were we supposed to
have breakfast this morning?

207
00:08:53,297 --> 00:08:54,596
I had an early consult.

208
00:08:54,598 --> 00:08:58,400
Yes, we always have breakfast
on Mondays.

209
00:08:58,402 --> 00:09:00,903
- We do?
- Every Monday.

210
00:09:00,905 --> 00:09:02,304
Every Monday.

211
00:09:02,306 --> 00:09:03,972
Thank you.

212
00:09:03,974 --> 00:09:07,876
Well, I guess our streak has
been broken then, huh?

213
00:09:07,878 --> 00:09:10,379
If someone punctures the bronchus

214
00:09:10,381 --> 00:09:13,916
during a routine bronchoscopy,
that's a mistake, right?

215
00:09:13,918 --> 00:09:16,685
Well, I can't imagine
how it wouldn't be.

216
00:09:16,687 --> 00:09:18,187
Why? What did you do, Shaun?

217
00:09:18,189 --> 00:09:21,857
I'm wondering if I need
to report Dr. Melendez.

218
00:09:21,859 --> 00:09:23,692
Dr. Melendez did that?

219
00:09:23,694 --> 00:09:25,761
The protocol is very clear.

220
00:09:25,763 --> 00:09:28,664
I need to report it.

221
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:32,167
But I've seen how Jared
is being treated.

222
00:09:32,169 --> 00:09:35,904
Will Dr. Melendez treat me badly
if I report this?

223
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,774
He shouldn't, obviously.

224
00:09:38,776 --> 00:09:42,244
But human nature being what...

225
00:09:42,246 --> 00:09:44,179
Human nature?

226
00:09:46,182 --> 00:09:47,249
Shaun, you know what?

227
00:09:47,251 --> 00:09:50,319
You should make this decision
for yourself.

228
00:09:53,924 --> 00:09:55,812
In fact... In fact...

229
00:09:55,837 --> 00:09:57,736
you should to make
all your decisions yourself

230
00:09:57,761 --> 00:09:59,728
from here on in.

231
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:02,831
That's what we agreed on, right?

232
00:10:08,706 --> 00:10:09,771
Have you considered

233
00:10:09,773 --> 00:10:11,240
an endovascular embolization procedure?

234
00:10:11,242 --> 00:10:12,307
I have.

235
00:10:12,309 --> 00:10:13,408
It's a little less risky,

236
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:14,610
but I haven't done as many,

237
00:10:14,612 --> 00:10:16,745
so I'm not sure which way
we're better off.

238
00:10:16,747 --> 00:10:18,213
You want me to check the roster...

239
00:10:18,215 --> 00:10:20,449
see if there's somebody
available with more experience?

240
00:10:20,451 --> 00:10:24,119
I would like to assist, but yes.

241
00:10:24,121 --> 00:10:25,921
Okay, here we go.

242
00:10:27,757 --> 00:10:28,991
No, he's not available.

243
00:10:28,993 --> 00:10:30,425
So make him available.

244
00:10:30,427 --> 00:10:32,060
I got a husband and father

245
00:10:32,062 --> 00:10:34,429
who presented with two aneurysms
in the last 12 hours.

246
00:10:34,431 --> 00:10:36,165
I'd rather not.

247
00:10:36,167 --> 00:10:39,601
This particular surgeon was recently...

248
00:10:39,603 --> 00:10:41,637
transferred.

249
00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:47,609
Not a chance.

250
00:10:47,611 --> 00:10:51,213
Coyle is the best available
surgeon for the job.

251
00:10:51,215 --> 00:10:53,315
Coyle should've been fired,
and if he'd been fired,

252
00:10:53,317 --> 00:10:54,449
he wouldn't be available.

253
00:10:54,451 --> 00:10:55,584
And if he wasn't available,

254
00:10:55,586 --> 00:10:58,253
you would be the best person
for the job.

255
00:10:58,255 --> 00:11:00,489
Our ultimate duty is to the patient.

256
00:11:02,927 --> 00:11:05,494
No, it's not.

257
00:11:05,496 --> 00:11:08,114
- You agree he should have been fired.
- Of course.

258
00:11:08,139 --> 00:11:09,865
Even if he was the best doctor
in this hospital,

259
00:11:09,867 --> 00:11:11,400
he should have been fired, right?

260
00:11:11,402 --> 00:11:12,968
Yes.

261
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:14,736
So some things have to matter more

262
00:11:14,738 --> 00:11:17,239
than who is the most skilled.

263
00:11:17,241 --> 00:11:19,875
If we forgive Coyle just because
he's good at something,

264
00:11:19,877 --> 00:11:22,678
what does he do next?

265
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,047
Either he matters or we matter.

266
00:11:34,224 --> 00:11:37,726
Were you upset during the procedure?

267
00:11:37,728 --> 00:11:40,529
Did Murphy tell you
that I was "traumatized"?

268
00:11:40,531 --> 00:11:42,264
You think that I might have
almost killed a person

269
00:11:42,266 --> 00:11:43,632
because you dumped me?

270
00:11:43,634 --> 00:11:45,867
The fact that you're describing
it as "me dumping you"

271
00:11:45,869 --> 00:11:48,470
suggests that you are upset.

272
00:11:48,472 --> 00:11:51,306
Look, I'm fine. You're fine.

273
00:11:51,308 --> 00:11:52,641
Nobody's upset.

274
00:11:52,643 --> 00:11:54,576
Great.

275
00:11:54,578 --> 00:11:55,844
But you do understand

276
00:11:55,846 --> 00:11:57,980
that I have to ask you these questions,

277
00:11:57,982 --> 00:11:59,548
that I need a statement from you.

278
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,350
Yes.

279
00:12:01,352 --> 00:12:03,151
Here's my statement...

280
00:12:03,153 --> 00:12:04,653
"I wasn't distracted.

281
00:12:04,655 --> 00:12:06,021
I didn't screw up."

282
00:12:06,023 --> 00:12:07,256
You get all that?

283
00:12:17,801 --> 00:12:19,568
Your bronchus was punctured
during the procedure,

284
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:20,636
but it's been repaired.

285
00:12:20,638 --> 00:12:23,338
How? How could that happen?

286
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,740
Why did you lie?

287
00:12:24,742 --> 00:12:26,608
You said that you inhaled smoke,

288
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:28,977
but there was no evidence of smoke.

289
00:12:28,979 --> 00:12:31,179
So, what do you gain
by lying to your doctors?

290
00:12:31,181 --> 00:12:32,381
I wasn't lying.

291
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,016
I was just...

292
00:12:34,018 --> 00:12:35,817
confused, I guess.

293
00:12:35,819 --> 00:12:37,152
I was in a lot of pain,

294
00:12:37,154 --> 00:12:39,388
and it was all happening so fast.

295
00:12:40,691 --> 00:12:41,957
My stomach!

296
00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:43,859
Naja, what are you feeling?

297
00:12:43,861 --> 00:12:46,294
It's really sore and...
I feel like I'm going to...

298
00:12:47,464 --> 00:12:49,464
Can we get some help over here?!

299
00:12:49,466 --> 00:12:51,950
Four milligrams of ondansetron.

300
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:55,137
Airway inflammation,
abdominal pain, nausea.

301
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:57,439
We need a full blood panel
and abdominal ultrasound.

302
00:13:00,311 --> 00:13:03,812
The procedure will seal off
the aneurysm,

303
00:13:03,814 --> 00:13:07,683
but there will almost certainly
be some brain damage...

304
00:13:07,685 --> 00:13:11,119
anything from mild visual
or speech disturbances

305
00:13:11,121 --> 00:13:14,990
to significant paralysis.

306
00:13:14,992 --> 00:13:18,093
But without the surgery, he'll die.

307
00:13:27,304 --> 00:13:31,340
No. I-I won't consent to the operation.

308
00:13:31,342 --> 00:13:34,743
There really isn't a lot of choice here.

309
00:13:34,745 --> 00:13:35,944
Without the operation...

310
00:13:35,946 --> 00:13:39,081
After his first stroke, it...

311
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:42,751
it took him so long to recover.

312
00:13:42,753 --> 00:13:47,789
It was frustrating and painful for him.

313
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:49,624
But he did recover.

314
00:13:53,797 --> 00:13:58,013
He made it clear he'd never want
to live compromised.

315
00:14:01,038 --> 00:14:02,738
Excuse me.

316
00:14:11,027 --> 00:14:14,129
Thank you for having breakfast with me.

317
00:14:14,131 --> 00:14:15,798
My pleasure.

318
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,654
People lie a lot, don't they?

319
00:14:18,738 --> 00:14:20,480
No, I-I meant it, Shaun.

320
00:14:20,511 --> 00:14:21,538
I'm happy to spend time with you.

321
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:24,608
There are seven reasons
that I've thought of.

322
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:27,213
There may even be more.

323
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:30,869
Do people ever lie without a reason?

324
00:14:30,901 --> 00:14:32,134
No.

325
00:14:37,807 --> 00:14:40,326
Reason number six.
I think you just lied.

326
00:14:40,351 --> 00:14:41,910
I think you just lied
to avoid something.

327
00:14:41,912 --> 00:14:43,778
You don't like this conversation.

328
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:46,314
Shaun, n... Shaun, I'm sorry.

329
00:14:46,316 --> 00:14:49,084
I'm just... just a little distracted.

330
00:14:49,086 --> 00:14:50,500
My aneurysm patient...

331
00:14:50,525 --> 00:14:52,587
We're treating him
with blood-pressure meds

332
00:14:52,589 --> 00:14:54,039
to try and avoid a rupture.

333
00:14:54,064 --> 00:14:57,325
You should do
an endovascular embolization.

334
00:14:57,327 --> 00:14:58,660
He doesn't want one.

335
00:14:58,662 --> 00:15:00,168
It could leave him with brain damage.

336
00:15:00,193 --> 00:15:03,698
- I thought he was unconscious.
- Yeah, he is.

337
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,067
His wife knows what he wants.

338
00:15:06,937 --> 00:15:09,235
It's amazing. I just...

339
00:15:09,259 --> 00:15:11,517
I don't think I'd be able to do that.

340
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,594
She's sacrificing her happiness,
her future,

341
00:15:14,619 --> 00:15:16,900
- just because she knows...
- She's lying.

342
00:15:16,998 --> 00:15:18,197
She's lying.

343
00:15:18,232 --> 00:15:21,767
It could be either
reason number four or...

344
00:15:21,769 --> 00:15:23,469
No, she's not lying, Shaun.
She loves him.

345
00:15:23,471 --> 00:15:24,537
She doesn't love him.

346
00:15:24,539 --> 00:15:26,005
You haven't even met her!

347
00:15:26,007 --> 00:15:28,274
You haven't seen what she's like
with him, with their son.

348
00:15:28,276 --> 00:15:29,742
I'm not good at reading people.

349
00:15:29,744 --> 00:15:32,411
- Well, I am, and...
- I think people-reading

350
00:15:32,413 --> 00:15:35,014
embraces personal biases.

351
00:15:35,016 --> 00:15:38,851
I think we should try to avoid biases.

352
00:15:38,853 --> 00:15:41,420
Knowledge of human behavior

353
00:15:41,422 --> 00:15:44,724
can help us make
informed, intuitive decisions.

354
00:15:44,726 --> 00:15:46,759
Mm, my way is better.

355
00:15:46,761 --> 00:15:50,162
It's based on actions. She's lying.

356
00:15:50,164 --> 00:15:51,330
All right.

357
00:15:51,332 --> 00:15:53,499
If you love someone,

358
00:15:53,501 --> 00:15:57,803
you'll do anything
to prevent their death.

359
00:16:03,644 --> 00:16:05,644
This... situation...

360
00:16:05,646 --> 00:16:09,014
There seems to be
a conflict of interest.

361
00:16:09,016 --> 00:16:11,751
So I would like to bring in
someone else from legal

362
00:16:11,753 --> 00:16:13,452
to handle it.

363
00:16:13,454 --> 00:16:15,521
Yeah, I agree.

364
00:16:15,523 --> 00:16:18,157
You're an excellent lawyer, but...

365
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:20,493
But what?

366
00:16:20,495 --> 00:16:22,061
Do you think this is my problem?

367
00:16:22,063 --> 00:16:23,562
It's understandable.

368
00:16:23,564 --> 00:16:25,064
48 hours ago, we were engaged.

369
00:16:25,066 --> 00:16:26,499
And now, suddenly,

370
00:16:26,501 --> 00:16:27,900
you're supposed to be investigating me?

371
00:16:27,902 --> 00:16:29,568
Yes.

372
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:30,803
And doing crazy things,

373
00:16:30,805 --> 00:16:33,038
like expecting you
to give me complete answers

374
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,273
to appropriate questions.

375
00:16:34,275 --> 00:16:36,809
You were trusting
Murphy's judgment over mine.

376
00:16:36,811 --> 00:16:39,178
<i>His</i> judgment about <i>my</i> demeanor.

377
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,913
Seriously?

378
00:16:40,915 --> 00:16:43,115
I asked you a question.

379
00:16:43,117 --> 00:16:44,183
You wanted me to screw up.

380
00:16:44,185 --> 00:16:45,584
You <i>did</i> screw up.

381
00:16:45,586 --> 00:16:46,552
So what?

382
00:16:46,554 --> 00:16:50,122
So we just deal with it.

383
00:16:50,124 --> 00:16:52,658
But if you can't even admit that
you're not always perfect,

384
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,827
- then I...
- I am not perfect!

385
00:16:57,532 --> 00:16:59,932
Clearly, I have made mistakes
in my life.

386
00:17:01,569 --> 00:17:03,135
But not this time.

387
00:17:03,137 --> 00:17:06,539
That punctured bronchus
was not my fault.

388
00:17:24,192 --> 00:17:27,593
The nurse says his vital signs
are stable.

389
00:17:27,595 --> 00:17:28,761
No change.

390
00:17:28,763 --> 00:17:30,262
That's good.

391
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,634
It's...

392
00:17:35,636 --> 00:17:39,071
such a great sacrifice

393
00:17:39,073 --> 00:17:43,275
to respect his wishes enough
to let him go.

394
00:17:43,277 --> 00:17:45,744
You must love your husband very much.

395
00:17:57,324 --> 00:18:00,426
But...

396
00:18:00,428 --> 00:18:03,496
there could be another explanation.

397
00:18:03,498 --> 00:18:08,000
Either you love him enough
to let him die...

398
00:18:08,002 --> 00:18:12,271
or you hate him enough to let him die.

399
00:18:12,273 --> 00:18:16,175
You don't know
what you're talking about.

400
00:18:16,177 --> 00:18:20,980
There's a doctor here who harassed me.

401
00:18:20,982 --> 00:18:23,916
He made me feel vulnerable, worthless...

402
00:18:23,918 --> 00:18:28,287
neither of which I am.

403
00:18:28,289 --> 00:18:32,224
But he never hurt me.

404
00:18:32,226 --> 00:18:37,129
I can't imagine how I would feel
if he did,

405
00:18:37,131 --> 00:18:39,899
what I would do,

406
00:18:39,901 --> 00:18:42,601
what I would <i>want to do to him.</i>

407
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,773
What did your husband do to you?

408
00:18:50,778 --> 00:18:53,579
He's a good father.

409
00:18:53,581 --> 00:18:55,748
No, he's not.

410
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:58,284
A good father doesn't hurt a mother.

411
00:18:58,286 --> 00:18:59,752
Payton loves him.

412
00:18:59,754 --> 00:19:00,819
All the more reason...

413
00:19:00,821 --> 00:19:02,121
No.

414
00:19:02,123 --> 00:19:04,995
Payton doesn't know anything.
He never can.

415
00:19:05,192 --> 00:19:08,260
I know you're afraid
he'll come after you,

416
00:19:08,262 --> 00:19:11,297
but there are people who can help.

417
00:19:23,344 --> 00:19:25,844
Payton is better off with
the memory of a loving father

418
00:19:25,846 --> 00:19:27,379
than the truth.

419
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,655
Let him die.

420
00:19:44,198 --> 00:19:48,567
Methanol is causing her abdominal pain.

421
00:19:48,569 --> 00:19:50,202
She drank wood alcohol?

422
00:19:50,204 --> 00:19:51,470
People drink whatever they can drink.

423
00:19:51,472 --> 00:19:53,439
Well, she's Muslim...
Wouldn't let me touch her.

424
00:19:53,441 --> 00:19:55,541
Religious people aren't
immune to hypocrisy.

425
00:19:55,543 --> 00:19:59,878
There are other ways to explain
the presence of methanol.

426
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,780
It's also produced by the liver

427
00:20:01,782 --> 00:20:04,350
when the body is exposed
to certain caustic chemicals.

428
00:20:04,352 --> 00:20:07,553
If inhaled, caustic chemicals
could also inflame the lungs.

429
00:20:07,555 --> 00:20:09,488
And caustic chemicals also burn,

430
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:11,223
so it would explain all her symptoms.

431
00:20:11,225 --> 00:20:12,324
Do you happen to have a list

432
00:20:12,326 --> 00:20:13,959
of which caustic chemicals do all that?

433
00:20:13,961 --> 00:20:16,428
Dimethyl sulfate...

434
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:18,864
It's used in
the pharmaceutical industry.

435
00:20:18,866 --> 00:20:20,633
- She's a school teacher.
- It's also used

436
00:20:20,635 --> 00:20:22,968
in water treatment,
industrial pesticides,

437
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:24,370
and chemical weapons.

438
00:20:24,372 --> 00:20:25,804
She has no reason to be involved

439
00:20:25,806 --> 00:20:27,911
with water treatment
or industrial pesticides.

440
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:29,975
But she could be a school teacher

441
00:20:29,977 --> 00:20:31,276
<i>and</i> a terrorist.

442
00:20:37,467 --> 00:20:40,139
- So, what do we do?
- The surgery.

443
00:20:40,264 --> 00:20:41,897
We don't have her consent.

444
00:20:41,899 --> 00:20:44,166
Technically, the issue is
we don't have <i>his</i> consent.

445
00:20:44,168 --> 00:20:46,468
We go to his wife
because we can't get his,

446
00:20:46,493 --> 00:20:48,244
the assumption being that
she's operating

447
00:20:48,269 --> 00:20:49,234
in his best interests.

448
00:20:49,259 --> 00:20:52,052
Pretty sure that's not happening here.

449
00:20:52,497 --> 00:20:54,262
Go back to the wife,
get her to change her mind,

450
00:20:54,264 --> 00:20:56,298
or we'll take it to court.

451
00:20:56,341 --> 00:20:58,243
Okay.

452
00:20:58,268 --> 00:20:59,367
Hey, you look annoyed.

453
00:20:59,369 --> 00:21:01,136
I'm annoyed we're sending him home

454
00:21:01,138 --> 00:21:02,571
to keep abusing his wife.

455
00:21:02,573 --> 00:21:04,806
She's a world-class liar.

456
00:21:04,808 --> 00:21:06,608
I mean, for all we know,
she wants her husband dead

457
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:09,210
so that she can run off
with her Pilates instructor.

458
00:21:09,212 --> 00:21:11,146
I'll get the consent.

459
00:21:11,148 --> 00:21:12,314
Thank you.

460
00:21:17,387 --> 00:21:19,921
She refused initial treatment
for methanol toxicity.

461
00:21:19,923 --> 00:21:21,122
It's ethanol...

462
00:21:21,124 --> 00:21:22,557
Because she's Muslim,
she can't consume it.

463
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,492
She has alcohol in her system

464
00:21:24,494 --> 00:21:26,528
but won't let us put alcohol
in her system to treat it,

465
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:28,463
because she doesn't want alcohol
in her system.

466
00:21:28,465 --> 00:21:30,830
- We put her on fomepi...
- Dr. Murphy...

467
00:21:30,876 --> 00:21:33,068
Is this part of your evidence
that she's a terrorist?

468
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:34,736
Because she's Muslim?

469
00:21:34,738 --> 00:21:36,671
There are billions of Muslims
that aren't terrorists.

470
00:21:36,673 --> 00:21:39,541
Is that part of your evidence
that she's not?

471
00:21:39,543 --> 00:21:42,110
I think she's a terrorist
because it's the easiest way

472
00:21:42,112 --> 00:21:44,112
to explain her symptoms and her lie.

473
00:21:44,114 --> 00:21:46,081
Do you have a way?

474
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:48,650
She had an accident. It scared her.

475
00:21:48,652 --> 00:21:49,718
Maybe <i>we</i> scare her.

476
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,820
Hell, maybe this whole place scares her.

477
00:21:51,822 --> 00:21:53,722
There are a lot of reasons
people don't tell the truth

478
00:21:53,724 --> 00:21:54,889
other than criminal activity.

479
00:21:54,891 --> 00:21:56,658
Six other reasons.

480
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:59,327
If a person comes in
with a gunshot wound,

481
00:21:59,329 --> 00:22:00,795
we have to report it.

482
00:22:00,797 --> 00:22:02,130
Why don't we have to report

483
00:22:02,132 --> 00:22:03,965
someone who might be making
chemical weapons?

484
00:22:03,967 --> 00:22:07,636
Because unfounded accusations
can destroy people's lives.

485
00:22:07,638 --> 00:22:10,105
What does it matter
what people speculate

486
00:22:10,107 --> 00:22:11,673
as long as the truth comes out?

487
00:22:11,675 --> 00:22:13,108
Because people make up their minds

488
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:14,442
before the truth comes out.

489
00:22:14,444 --> 00:22:16,244
Says the guy who played the race card

490
00:22:16,246 --> 00:22:17,646
when he needed an advantage.

491
00:22:17,648 --> 00:22:19,347
Even if you're right,

492
00:22:19,349 --> 00:22:22,217
she's not making bombs
while she's in our ICU.

493
00:22:22,219 --> 00:22:24,686
Also, you're wrong. Now, keep me posted.

494
00:22:24,688 --> 00:22:26,755
If she's not better
in the next two hours,

495
00:22:26,757 --> 00:22:28,757
I want to know.

496
00:22:39,935 --> 00:22:42,937
We need you to consent
to your husband's surgery.

497
00:22:45,374 --> 00:22:47,175
I said "no."

498
00:22:49,178 --> 00:22:53,281
There's a better way, Tessa.

499
00:22:53,283 --> 00:22:55,150
Leave him.

500
00:22:55,152 --> 00:22:57,686
Start a new life.

501
00:23:03,292 --> 00:23:04,926
I'm afraid.

502
00:23:04,928 --> 00:23:06,261
I know.

503
00:23:06,263 --> 00:23:08,792
But... this...

504
00:23:08,965 --> 00:23:11,862
This isn't the answer.

505
00:23:12,402 --> 00:23:14,235
If you don't consent,

506
00:23:14,237 --> 00:23:15,503
we'll take this to the court,

507
00:23:15,505 --> 00:23:18,573
and we'll tell a judge what we know.

508
00:23:18,575 --> 00:23:20,909
I told you those things in confidence.

509
00:23:20,911 --> 00:23:23,144
You are not my patient. Your husband is.

510
00:23:25,549 --> 00:23:28,249
Two things will happen.

511
00:23:28,251 --> 00:23:29,918
We <i>will</i> get the consent,

512
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,253
and Payton will find out the truth.

513
00:24:05,789 --> 00:24:08,857
Tessa?

514
00:24:08,859 --> 00:24:13,194
You are stronger than you think you are.

515
00:24:33,115 --> 00:24:36,484
Your methanol toxicity is abating...

516
00:24:36,486 --> 00:24:38,419
The treatment's working.

517
00:24:38,421 --> 00:24:40,655
Great.

518
00:24:40,657 --> 00:24:44,058
Um... do you think that
I'll be able to leave soon?

519
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:46,461
All of your symptoms are consistent

520
00:24:46,463 --> 00:24:48,730
with exposure to dimethyl sulfate.

521
00:24:48,732 --> 00:24:51,533
I... I've never heard of dimethyl...

522
00:24:51,535 --> 00:24:55,770
Dimethyl sulfate is used
to make chemical weapons.

523
00:25:02,044 --> 00:25:05,880
I didn't expect this from <i>you.</i>

524
00:25:05,882 --> 00:25:09,150
I made a statement.

525
00:25:09,152 --> 00:25:11,519
You're different.

526
00:25:11,521 --> 00:25:13,621
I have autism.

527
00:25:13,623 --> 00:25:15,924
You've experienced bigotry.

528
00:25:15,926 --> 00:25:19,127
Yes.

529
00:25:19,129 --> 00:25:24,299
Have... people refused to serve you?

530
00:25:24,301 --> 00:25:27,368
Have you seen people

531
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:29,470
change their flight

532
00:25:29,472 --> 00:25:32,240
because of you?

533
00:25:32,242 --> 00:25:33,708
Have people cursed you out

534
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:36,211
before you've opened your mouth?

535
00:25:38,748 --> 00:25:40,982
I'm not prejudiced.

536
00:25:40,984 --> 00:25:43,017
I have evidence.

537
00:25:43,019 --> 00:25:45,753
Nobody's prejudiced.

538
00:25:45,755 --> 00:25:48,790
Everybody has evidence.

539
00:25:48,792 --> 00:25:51,626
And I'm always brown.

540
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:55,530
Maybe you're not so different.

541
00:25:59,569 --> 00:26:02,937
You're sweating.

542
00:26:02,939 --> 00:26:05,473
Perspiration is a sign of dishonesty.

543
00:26:08,879 --> 00:26:10,044
My chest.

544
00:26:10,046 --> 00:26:12,547
Chest pain can be brought on by anxiety.

545
00:26:14,117 --> 00:26:16,918
Oh, but this time,
you <i>are</i> having a heart attack.

546
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,586
EKG, stat!

547
00:26:21,524 --> 00:26:24,225
The endothelial lining
had moderate inflammation

548
00:26:24,227 --> 00:26:25,393
that appeared acute,

549
00:26:25,395 --> 00:26:28,129
and there was evidence of mucosal edema.

550
00:26:28,131 --> 00:26:29,898
I made no extraordinary motions,

551
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:32,467
nor did I apply any unnecessary force.

552
00:26:32,469 --> 00:26:34,302
And yet, the bronchus was punctured.

553
00:26:34,304 --> 00:26:36,104
Which is a risk, albeit a small one,

554
00:26:36,106 --> 00:26:37,772
with this kind of procedure.

555
00:26:39,909 --> 00:26:41,142
Well...

556
00:26:41,144 --> 00:26:42,577
thank you.

557
00:26:42,579 --> 00:26:45,013
I appreciate the thoroughness
of your answers.

558
00:26:45,015 --> 00:26:47,515
Not sure I understood it all...

559
00:26:47,517 --> 00:26:51,152
...but I think I've got what I need.

560
00:26:51,154 --> 00:26:54,656
I probably shouldn't say anything,

561
00:26:54,658 --> 00:26:55,890
but I know you and Ms. Preston

562
00:26:55,892 --> 00:26:57,191
are going through something right now.

563
00:26:57,193 --> 00:26:58,693
That really wasn't relevant.

564
00:26:58,695 --> 00:27:01,062
Oh, I-I know. I know. It's just...

565
00:27:02,364 --> 00:27:05,733
I know she'll get through it, but...

566
00:27:05,735 --> 00:27:08,469
it's good you're handling it better.

567
00:27:08,471 --> 00:27:11,806
It's one thing to be distracted
while drafting a contract

568
00:27:11,808 --> 00:27:15,043
and a whole other thing entirely
doing what you do.

569
00:27:26,022 --> 00:27:28,122
Inject dye.

570
00:27:28,124 --> 00:27:30,959
Injecting dye.

571
00:27:34,264 --> 00:27:36,798
Hanging a left at the vertebral artery.

572
00:27:39,868 --> 00:27:43,237
Okay, withdrawing the guide wire.

573
00:27:43,239 --> 00:27:44,906
Inserting the platinum matrix.

574
00:27:49,445 --> 00:27:52,347
You know, sometimes,
you do the right thing

575
00:27:52,349 --> 00:27:54,515
and things get a little better.

576
00:27:54,517 --> 00:27:56,818
And sometimes, things still suck.

577
00:28:00,089 --> 00:28:02,640
Entering the aneurysm.

578
00:28:04,627 --> 00:28:06,060
Okay.

579
00:28:07,364 --> 00:28:09,297
- Blood pressure's spiking.
- Wait, why?

580
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:10,965
There's no rupture, no bleeding,

581
00:28:10,967 --> 00:28:12,214
no stroke.

582
00:28:12,239 --> 00:28:15,269
If his BP goes up any higher,
he <i>will</i> have a stroke.

583
00:28:15,271 --> 00:28:17,005
I'm terminating the procedure.

584
00:28:17,163 --> 00:28:20,148
Push 20 milligrams of labetalol, stat.

585
00:28:26,026 --> 00:28:29,127
We need to stabilize him before
we can retry the procedure,

586
00:28:29,182 --> 00:28:31,549
which means we need
to figure out what we missed.

587
00:28:31,551 --> 00:28:33,384
This wasn't our fault.

588
00:28:33,386 --> 00:28:35,620
His BP was stable going in.

589
00:28:35,622 --> 00:28:37,021
He's been on calcium-channel blockers

590
00:28:37,023 --> 00:28:38,756
- for the last six years.
- Well, we missed something.

591
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:42,022
BP doesn't skyrocket for no reason.

592
00:28:42,529 --> 00:28:43,861
Run a full work-up.

593
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:49,093
Why would a 28-year-old
with no risk factors

594
00:28:49,118 --> 00:28:50,639
have a heart attack?

595
00:28:50,698 --> 00:28:51,788
Hmm.

596
00:28:51,887 --> 00:28:54,210
Her heart is burning.

597
00:28:54,657 --> 00:28:55,856
Burning?

598
00:28:55,858 --> 00:28:57,791
From the caustic chemical!

599
00:28:57,793 --> 00:29:00,928
- Murphy.
- It's going through her system.

600
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:03,197
Unlike thermal burns,

601
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:05,258
chemical burns get worse over time.

602
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:08,458
And it also explains
the punctured bronchus.

603
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,794
The caustic chemical
thinned the bronchial walls.

604
00:29:10,796 --> 00:29:12,629
You did not make a mistake.

605
00:29:12,631 --> 00:29:14,464
That's not the only explanation.

606
00:29:15,733 --> 00:29:17,267
But I'll shut up now.

607
00:29:17,269 --> 00:29:18,501
You think you have a good idea,

608
00:29:18,503 --> 00:29:21,004
but you're going to shut yourself up?

609
00:29:21,006 --> 00:29:23,473
It could be caused by an infection

610
00:29:23,475 --> 00:29:27,110
from bacteria that leaked
as a result of the puncture.

611
00:29:27,112 --> 00:29:30,647
The treatments are
diametrically opposed...

612
00:29:30,649 --> 00:29:33,250
antibiotics if it's infection,

613
00:29:33,252 --> 00:29:35,418
steroids if it's inflammation.

614
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:38,388
If she needs antibiotics
and she needs steroids instead,

615
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:39,656
it will suppress her immune system,

616
00:29:39,658 --> 00:29:42,025
causing the infection
to flourish and kill her.

617
00:29:42,027 --> 00:29:43,627
If she needs steroids

618
00:29:43,629 --> 00:29:45,462
and we give her antibiotics, then...

619
00:29:45,464 --> 00:29:46,863
I get it.

620
00:29:46,865 --> 00:29:49,266
- We'd better be right.
- Yes.

621
00:29:49,268 --> 00:29:51,935
Sir, I think we should bring
another senior attending in

622
00:29:51,937 --> 00:29:54,104
- to consult on this decision.
- Why?

623
00:29:54,106 --> 00:29:56,172
Because if Shaun's right,
you're exonerated.

624
00:29:56,174 --> 00:29:57,707
And if I'm right,
you may have made the mistake

625
00:29:57,709 --> 00:30:00,010
that could kill this woman.

626
00:30:00,012 --> 00:30:02,212
You don't think I can be objective?

627
00:30:02,214 --> 00:30:04,247
I think you're incredibly
professional...

628
00:30:04,249 --> 00:30:05,181
Shut up, Jared.

629
00:30:08,919 --> 00:30:15,525
It is possible that I screwed up.

630
00:30:15,527 --> 00:30:17,694
Let's put her on
broadspectrum antibiotics.

631
00:30:17,696 --> 00:30:19,829
You're wrong.

632
00:30:19,831 --> 00:30:21,231
Making a decision

633
00:30:21,233 --> 00:30:23,266
on the assumption you made a mistake

634
00:30:23,268 --> 00:30:24,167
is a mistake.

635
00:30:24,169 --> 00:30:27,093
You're very arrogant.

636
00:30:27,773 --> 00:30:30,307
It helps you be a great surgeon.

637
00:30:32,343 --> 00:30:34,678
Fortunately, I don't need your approval.

638
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:48,191
We've determined what
the underlying problem was.

639
00:30:48,193 --> 00:30:49,993
What caused your husband's
aneurysm to rupture

640
00:30:49,995 --> 00:30:52,395
and why his blood pressure
spiked in the O.R.

641
00:30:52,397 --> 00:30:55,365
According to his labs,
he hasn't been taking his meds.

642
00:30:55,367 --> 00:30:57,200
As far as I know, he has.

643
00:30:57,202 --> 00:30:59,469
I mean, that's just not like him.

644
00:30:59,471 --> 00:31:02,205
We don't think it's like him, either.

645
00:31:04,642 --> 00:31:07,777
You think I had something
to do with this?

646
00:31:07,779 --> 00:31:10,447
That I, what, threw his meds away?

647
00:31:10,449 --> 00:31:14,017
He'd just order more.

648
00:31:14,019 --> 00:31:17,554
But if you emptied his capsules
and filled them with sugar...

649
00:31:17,556 --> 00:31:20,256
or, even better, salt...

650
00:31:20,258 --> 00:31:22,292
It would end your nightmare.

651
00:31:25,197 --> 00:31:27,597
I was willing to let him die,

652
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:33,536
but I could never...

653
00:31:33,538 --> 00:31:37,407
If I were strong enough to kill him...

654
00:31:48,053 --> 00:31:50,453
Is there a chance your son knows more

655
00:31:50,455 --> 00:31:52,455
than you think he does?

656
00:32:13,412 --> 00:32:14,844
Her heart rate's 90.

657
00:32:14,846 --> 00:32:16,746
That's in the normal range.

658
00:32:16,748 --> 00:32:19,482
But it was 83. It should be going down.

659
00:32:19,484 --> 00:32:21,985
All her other signs are normal.

660
00:32:21,987 --> 00:32:25,121
You were right.
This is the proper treatment.

661
00:32:25,123 --> 00:32:26,289
95.

662
00:32:29,761 --> 00:32:32,095
I'm switching her to steroids.

663
00:32:32,097 --> 00:32:33,730
If we give her steroids,

664
00:32:33,732 --> 00:32:35,932
it will suppress her immune system,

665
00:32:35,934 --> 00:32:37,300
causing the infection to flourish...

666
00:32:37,302 --> 00:32:39,135
I'm going to push 40 milligrams
of methylprednisolone.

667
00:32:39,137 --> 00:32:40,537
...and she'll die.

668
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,684
This is on me.

669
00:32:43,775 --> 00:32:45,608
I know.

670
00:32:52,894 --> 00:32:55,535
We switched her to methylprednisolone.

671
00:32:55,933 --> 00:32:57,099
It's working.

672
00:32:57,153 --> 00:32:58,819
You were wrong.

673
00:32:58,844 --> 00:33:00,210
Yeah, I got that.

674
00:33:00,212 --> 00:33:02,613
Just about the treatment choice.

675
00:33:02,615 --> 00:33:05,135
- You didn't do anything wrong in the O.R.
- Don't kiss my ass.

676
00:33:05,322 --> 00:33:08,768
Jared saved her life.

677
00:33:09,907 --> 00:33:12,389
If he hadn't acted so quickly,
she would've died,

678
00:33:12,391 --> 00:33:14,954
and that would've been your fault.

679
00:33:14,979 --> 00:33:15,953
Yes, it would've.

680
00:33:15,978 --> 00:33:17,311
You should thank him.

681
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:26,811
Thank you, Dr. Kalu.

682
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:22,543
Hey.

683
00:34:22,545 --> 00:34:23,777
Can I help you?

684
00:34:23,779 --> 00:34:26,480
I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.

685
00:34:26,482 --> 00:34:30,584
You're my new neighbor, number 34.

686
00:34:30,586 --> 00:34:32,740
Yeah, cool.

687
00:34:32,899 --> 00:34:35,066
Uh, you wanna come in for a beer?

688
00:34:35,091 --> 00:34:36,167
No.

689
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,966
Nice work.

690
00:34:45,968 --> 00:34:47,211
You, too.

691
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,271
You can have the honors.

692
00:34:51,841 --> 00:34:53,641
This is the first time
I'm not looking forward

693
00:34:53,643 --> 00:34:56,143
to telling the family it went well.

694
00:35:22,838 --> 00:35:24,718
You're going to be fine.

695
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:27,109
The treatment worked?

696
00:35:27,176 --> 00:35:30,077
The second one did.
The first one almost killed you.

697
00:35:30,133 --> 00:35:32,300
The fact that you're alive
right now is evidence

698
00:35:32,301 --> 00:35:34,034
that you were working
with dimethyl sulfate.

699
00:35:34,036 --> 00:35:37,652
You're a terrorist, aren't you?

700
00:35:38,841 --> 00:35:42,029
My brother works for a drug company.

701
00:35:42,177 --> 00:35:45,412
They use dimethyl sulfate to
make one of their medications.

702
00:35:45,414 --> 00:35:46,613
He stole some for me.

703
00:35:46,615 --> 00:35:49,216
So you could make a chemical weapon.

704
00:35:49,218 --> 00:35:55,856
So I could make perfume.

705
00:35:55,858 --> 00:35:57,057
Smell that.

706
00:36:09,904 --> 00:36:13,140
It's... beautiful.

707
00:36:13,142 --> 00:36:14,674
But very stupid.

708
00:36:14,676 --> 00:36:16,543
Yeah.

709
00:36:16,545 --> 00:36:19,146
Especially since my brother
would get fired

710
00:36:19,148 --> 00:36:20,714
if anyone ever found out.

711
00:36:22,683 --> 00:36:23,617
You believe her?

712
00:36:23,619 --> 00:36:25,752
Protecting someone...

713
00:36:25,754 --> 00:36:27,788
reason number three.

714
00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:32,959
So... we good?

715
00:36:32,961 --> 00:36:34,928
Thing is, I'm not sure
it really matters.

716
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:36,997
I've been told I can only have
three residents next year.

717
00:36:36,999 --> 00:36:38,198
That's great.

718
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,466
Not really.

719
00:36:39,468 --> 00:36:42,369
Because of Coyle's transfer,
I have to take on his.

720
00:36:42,371 --> 00:36:44,704
Reznick?

721
00:36:44,706 --> 00:36:47,107
She's a pain.

722
00:36:47,109 --> 00:36:49,643
Pain can be a hell of motivator.

723
00:36:49,645 --> 00:36:50,544
Good luck.

724
00:36:57,084 --> 00:36:58,518
You were right.

725
00:37:00,755 --> 00:37:05,158
And I think you were right that
I wanted you to be wrong.

726
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,928
And I'm sorry.

727
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:11,131
You were right, too.

728
00:37:11,133 --> 00:37:15,001
I kept telling myself that
I'm fine, but...

729
00:37:15,003 --> 00:37:16,770
it's been hard.

730
00:37:16,772 --> 00:37:18,638
Got me second-guessing myself,

731
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,074
maybe affecting my judgment.

732
00:37:21,076 --> 00:37:23,677
I don't know.

733
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:26,713
If we're hurting so bad,
maybe we made a mistake.

734
00:37:29,384 --> 00:37:30,617
No.

735
00:37:30,619 --> 00:37:33,019
It just means that what we had mattered.

736
00:37:33,021 --> 00:37:36,256
Doesn't mean that it was right.

737
00:37:36,258 --> 00:37:38,959
I've also been thinking that...

738
00:37:38,961 --> 00:37:41,428
arrogance does make me a better surgeon.

739
00:37:43,564 --> 00:37:45,298
But it's not gonna make me
a better husband.

740
00:37:48,437 --> 00:37:50,704
I'm sorry.

741
00:38:02,751 --> 00:38:04,985
Kristin?

742
00:38:04,987 --> 00:38:06,620
Hey, I'm Claire.

743
00:38:06,622 --> 00:38:07,854
Hi.

744
00:38:07,856 --> 00:38:11,658
Thanks.

745
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:13,093
Um,

746
00:38:13,095 --> 00:38:18,532
I am doing some research on Dr. Coyle...

747
00:38:18,534 --> 00:38:23,203
on the women who worked with him
and then quit.

748
00:38:23,205 --> 00:38:28,909
I got another offer at SF Muni.

749
00:38:28,911 --> 00:38:33,513
I was harassed by Dr. Coyle.

750
00:38:33,515 --> 00:38:35,482
And I think you were, too.

751
00:38:48,163 --> 00:38:53,800
Doing the right thing can make
things a little better...

752
00:38:53,802 --> 00:38:56,136
especially if we do it together.

753
00:39:17,959 --> 00:39:20,427
I have a new neighbor.

754
00:39:20,429 --> 00:39:24,864
Hmm. So, Lea's really gone, huh?

755
00:39:24,866 --> 00:39:28,068
So, can we have breakfast tomorrow?

756
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:32,138
I'd love to, Shaun, but...

757
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:37,177
we, um...

758
00:39:37,179 --> 00:39:38,778
We talked about this, right?

759
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:41,581
I-I said that I would

760
00:39:41,583 --> 00:39:44,117
back off if you stayed, right?

761
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:45,118
More space, less "fathering."

762
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,774
I don't need a father.

763
00:39:46,799 --> 00:39:48,321
I hate fathers.

764
00:39:48,323 --> 00:39:51,157
- Right, so...
- I need a friend.

765
00:39:55,896 --> 00:39:59,532
Shaun, I-I am someone who can't help

766
00:39:59,534 --> 00:40:01,334
but give advice, you know?

767
00:40:01,336 --> 00:40:05,005
I don't know if I can <i>not</i> do that.

768
00:40:07,141 --> 00:40:11,277
So you think I can change and you can't?

769
00:40:13,814 --> 00:40:16,583
I think that we have
a certain kind of relationship.

770
00:40:16,585 --> 00:40:19,285
And we can call it something
different if we want,

771
00:40:19,287 --> 00:40:22,022
but we can't magically
make it different.

772
00:40:22,024 --> 00:40:24,024
You said that you wanted space.

773
00:40:24,026 --> 00:40:26,226
You said that you needed space.

774
00:40:32,299 --> 00:40:37,871
I-I think you should be my friend.

775
00:40:43,278 --> 00:40:44,778
Shaun...

776
00:40:59,027 --> 00:41:00,460
Okay.

777
00:41:03,799 --> 00:41:05,732
Shaun?

778
00:41:52,114 --> 00:41:55,963
What are you smelling right now?

779
00:41:56,493 --> 00:41:58,064
Pine trees.

780
00:42:00,455 --> 00:42:01,654
Mmm.

781
00:42:09,921 --> 00:42:14,921
