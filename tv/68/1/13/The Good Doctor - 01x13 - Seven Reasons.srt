1
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:35,136
I was late! It's okay, sweetie.
It's not your fault.

2
00:00:35,169 --> 00:00:36,780
I just wanted to play
one more game at Gary's.

3
00:00:36,804 --> 00:00:39,107
Well, you did great.
You called 911 right away.

4
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,641
He looked dead.
Daddy's not dead.

5
00:00:40,674 --> 00:00:42,310
He's gonna be okay, right?

6
00:00:42,343 --> 00:00:43,811
He had a stroke.
That's not possible!

7
00:00:43,844 --> 00:00:45,813
Well, the CT confirmed
a ruptured aneurysm.

8
00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:47,415
We have to operate
to clip the bleeding

9
00:00:47,448 --> 00:00:48,782
and reduce
intracranial pressure.

10
00:00:48,816 --> 00:00:50,318
No, he had a stroke
six years ago.

11
00:00:50,351 --> 00:00:52,553
They put him on diltiazem.

12
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:54,106
We're gonna take good care
of your dad.

13
00:00:57,291 --> 00:01:00,461
Naja Modi... 28 years old,
suffered a burn to her left hand

14
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:02,463
as a result
of a cooking accident.

15
00:01:02,496 --> 00:01:05,633
Are Jared and I being punished?

16
00:01:07,468 --> 00:01:10,604
This is not a very
interesting case, is it?

17
00:01:10,638 --> 00:01:12,240
Lesson one...

18
00:01:12,273 --> 00:01:14,208
Don't suggest
to the the head of surgery

19
00:01:14,242 --> 00:01:15,743
that working with
the head of surgery

20
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,345
is form of punishment.

21
00:01:17,378 --> 00:01:21,282
Dr. Melendez is
very unhappy with Jared

22
00:01:21,315 --> 00:01:23,317
for how he got his job back.

23
00:01:23,351 --> 00:01:26,387
And Dr. Melendez is unhappy
with me for t-taking...

24
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,888
Taking two days off.

25
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:31,592
I don't think he wants to talk
about this, Shaun.

26
00:01:35,296 --> 00:01:36,697
I was an idiot.

27
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,300
It's on the stove.
Of course it's hot, right?

28
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:41,611
You wouldn't believe how often
we see these types of accidents.

29
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:43,404
Well, there are a lot of idiots.

30
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:45,639
Okay, what do we need
to do here, Murphy?

31
00:01:45,673 --> 00:01:48,142
A superficial
partial-thickness burn

32
00:01:48,176 --> 00:01:49,677
should be managed
conservatively.

33
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,745
Cleanse the area,
debride with soft gauze,

34
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:54,148
and then cover
with an antimicrobial

35
00:01:54,182 --> 00:01:55,316
petroleum dressing.

36
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:56,484
All of which means,

37
00:01:56,517 --> 00:01:58,752
this should heal
with minimal scarring.

38
00:02:00,321 --> 00:02:02,456
Naja, are you having chest pain?

39
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:03,924
I think I'm having
a heart attack.

40
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,226
It's hard to breathe.

41
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:07,761
Just relax if you can.

42
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:09,530
Put her on oxygen,
a 12 lead EKG,

43
00:02:09,563 --> 00:02:10,931
and order a portable
chest X-ray.

44
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,166
Murphy, let's move. Come on.

45
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,468
Her vitals are stable.

46
00:02:16,737 --> 00:02:18,206
What the hell is going on here?

47
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,208
I don't know.

48
00:02:20,241 --> 00:02:22,543
But it is interesting.

49
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:37,358
We've got a subarachnoid
hemorrhage. Suction.

50
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:39,593
I need to isolate the aneurysm.

51
00:02:39,627 --> 00:02:41,829
Poor kid.

52
00:02:41,862 --> 00:02:44,465
Imagine finding your dad
like that.

53
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:46,600
Well, that's exactly
how I want to die.

54
00:02:48,436 --> 00:02:49,337
If the dad doesn't make it,

55
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,372
the kid will always remember
that moment...

56
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:52,640
Be traumatized by it.

57
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:54,342
Because he loves him.

58
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,677
The idea of dying without
anybody getting hurt...

59
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:59,313
There's nothing sadder than
an empty waiting room.

60
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,518
Okay, what do you see?

61
00:03:04,552 --> 00:03:06,954
A bulge on the anterior
communicating artery.

62
00:03:06,987 --> 00:03:08,756
Yeah, the ruptured aneurysm
is compromising

63
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:10,424
blood flow to the frontal lobe.

64
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:12,393
Prep an 11 millimeter
standard clip.

65
00:03:12,426 --> 00:03:13,861
Are you married?

66
00:03:13,894 --> 00:03:15,463
Not anymore.

67
00:03:15,496 --> 00:03:18,299
Turns out he had even worse
judgment than I did.

68
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:20,601
Oh, speaking of creeps,
you hear Coyle got transferred?

69
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:22,770
I'm so glad they shut him down.

70
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:25,005
Well, yeah, I guess.

71
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,608
Just wish they'd spent the money
on a Pediatric Trauma Pod.

72
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:33,447
They gave him a raise.

73
00:03:33,481 --> 00:03:35,849
Clip.

74
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:37,651
The EKG confirmed

75
00:03:37,685 --> 00:03:39,320
you weren't
having a heart attack.

76
00:03:39,353 --> 00:03:40,988
I-I wasn't faking.

77
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:41,789
I wouldn't do that.

78
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:43,457
We know.

79
00:03:43,491 --> 00:03:44,425
The imaging also confirmed

80
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,327
that you have considerable
lung inflammation.

81
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,828
Is it possible
you inhaled smoke?

82
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:49,363
I guess I must have.

83
00:03:49,397 --> 00:03:51,699
There was a minor grease fire.

84
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:52,566
What happens now?

85
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,735
You need a bronchoscopy.

86
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:56,680
We put a camera down your throat
to see how much damage there is

87
00:03:56,704 --> 00:03:58,572
and what we need to do
to repair it.

88
00:03:58,606 --> 00:04:00,308
But don't worry.
You'll be sedated.

89
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:01,509
Please don't.

90
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:02,943
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.

91
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:04,512
The test is absolutely
necessary.

92
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:05,779
The test is fine.

93
00:04:05,813 --> 00:04:06,814
But, um...

94
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:09,583
please don't touch me,
except for medical purposes.

95
00:04:09,617 --> 00:04:11,051
Yeah, of course.

96
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:20,561
That does not make sense.

97
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,339
A number of religions have rules
about touching.

98
00:04:22,363 --> 00:04:23,531
I don't quite get it, but...

99
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:24,698
That makes sense.

100
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:26,367
People shouldn't touch people

101
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,735
unless there's
a very good reason.

102
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,970
Okay, then...

103
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:31,772
what doesn't make sense?

104
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:34,442
The grease fire.

105
00:04:34,475 --> 00:04:36,052
The grease fire explains
the whole thing...

106
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:37,711
The burn, the smoke.

107
00:04:37,745 --> 00:04:41,349
She told us she forgot
the stove was hot.

108
00:04:41,382 --> 00:04:42,850
How can you forget
something's hot

109
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:44,084
when it is on fire?

110
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,586
Shaun,

111
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:46,796
I'm sure we would have heard
more of the story

112
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:50,524
if she hadn't suddenly thought
she was having a heart attack.

113
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:56,964
Why didn't you fire him?

114
00:04:56,997 --> 00:04:58,542
Because his story was different
than yours.

115
00:04:58,566 --> 00:05:01,369
And you believe his story?

116
00:05:01,402 --> 00:05:02,936
I believe your story.

117
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,972
But you can't prove it.

118
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:06,740
And we simply can't
make a policy

119
00:05:06,774 --> 00:05:08,909
of believing every woman
who files a complaint

120
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:10,010
against every man.

121
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:15,082
After a few thousand years
of doing the opposite,

122
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:16,717
it wouldn't kill us
to overcorrect.

123
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,428
And the fact that
your boyfriend assaulted him

124
00:05:18,452 --> 00:05:20,454
took away any leverage I had.

125
00:05:20,488 --> 00:05:21,789
I did what I could.

126
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:23,891
I got him to take a position

127
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:26,727
where he has very little contact
with staff, with patients...

128
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,795
Outreach chair.

129
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,597
And it's a lousy assignment.

130
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,499
Sooner or later,
he's gonna quit.

131
00:05:31,532 --> 00:05:33,801
And get a job somewhere else.

132
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:37,505
If you have any better ideas...

133
00:05:37,538 --> 00:05:39,973
I look forward to hearing them.

134
00:05:51,619 --> 00:05:54,655
Lim: You're very lucky.

135
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:57,425
The aneurysm was in
a small communicating artery.

136
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:58,859
We were able
to restore blood flow

137
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:00,060
to the impacted brain areas.

138
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:01,462
He's gonna be okay.

139
00:06:01,495 --> 00:06:02,630
Thank God.

140
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:10,438
Is this what life is gonna be
like from now on?

141
00:06:10,471 --> 00:06:13,441
A-Are these things just going
to keep happening?

142
00:06:13,474 --> 00:06:15,443
We're gonna keep him here
for a few days,

143
00:06:15,476 --> 00:06:16,710
do some follow-up testing,

144
00:06:16,744 --> 00:06:19,413
make some adjustments
to his medications.

145
00:06:19,447 --> 00:06:21,849
Hopefully, we'll find out
why this happened.

146
00:06:24,552 --> 00:06:25,886
I have to go.

147
00:06:27,755 --> 00:06:29,757
Another one?

148
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:32,460
Post-operative imaging showed
a 26-millimeter aneurysm

149
00:06:32,493 --> 00:06:33,694
in the basilar artery.

150
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,962
That size and location,

151
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:36,564
we're looking at
a high risk of rupture.

152
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:38,107
He must have a genetic
predisposition...

153
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:40,200
Maybe a connective
tissue disease?

154
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:43,737
All academic till we repair it.

155
00:06:43,771 --> 00:06:44,881
Melendez: Through the pharynx

156
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:47,441
and over
to Grandmother's house we go.

157
00:06:47,475 --> 00:06:51,645
There's the epiglottis
and the vocal cords.

158
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:53,814
I know you're not happy that
I sued the hospital.

159
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:55,158
But I'm not gonna apologize
for that.

160
00:06:55,182 --> 00:06:57,451
That makes it simple.

161
00:06:57,485 --> 00:06:59,453
I did it because
I want to be here.

162
00:06:59,487 --> 00:07:00,864
I believe I can learn
a lot from you,

163
00:07:00,888 --> 00:07:03,223
even from your doghouse.

164
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,736
I just hope you give me
a chance, sir.

165
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,028
There's the carina.

166
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:10,498
Gonna pass into the mainstem
bronchus of the left lung.

167
00:07:10,531 --> 00:07:13,934
Is breaking up with your fiancée
traumatic?

168
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,172
When I saw a woman get shot,

169
00:07:19,206 --> 00:07:21,041
everyone told me
it was traumatic

170
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:22,943
and that I should be going home.

171
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:26,580
Should you be going home?

172
00:07:26,614 --> 00:07:28,224
Give me a mucosal brush
for a cellular sample.

173
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:29,149
Loading it now.

174
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:31,619
How long does it take
to get over a breakup

175
00:07:31,652 --> 00:07:32,986
with the woman you love?

176
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:36,624
I'm seeing
a lot of inflammation,

177
00:07:36,657 --> 00:07:37,825
but no smoke damage.

178
00:07:37,858 --> 00:07:39,827
That makes se-sense.

179
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,771
I thought we were doing this
because she inhaled smoke.

180
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,731
She said she inhaled smoke.

181
00:07:43,764 --> 00:07:45,733
I didn't believe her.

182
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:46,876
Whatever the cause,
the inflammation

183
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,001
and the damage are real.

184
00:07:48,035 --> 00:07:50,137
Let's get a mucosal biopsy.

185
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:53,040
I move down here, we...

186
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:54,575
The scope breached
her bronchial wall.

187
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:55,809
She's hemorrhaging.

188
00:07:55,843 --> 00:07:57,911
This is bad. Prep the O.R.!

189
00:07:57,945 --> 00:07:59,985
Type and cross two units
of blood. We've gotta move!

190
00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:05,986
We know there was a burn.

191
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:07,196
Was it something related
to the grease fire,

192
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,922
or separate coincidental injury?

193
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:15,095
You don't have a theory,

194
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:17,230
or are you refusing
to talk to Jared?

195
00:08:17,264 --> 00:08:18,875
Melendez: I didn't answer
because it doesn't matter

196
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:20,233
until we can repair
this puncture

197
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:22,903
before bacteria passes through
and spreads an infection.

198
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:24,004
That's true.

199
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:25,205
Cut this suture.

200
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:27,641
Let's approximate the edges
with forceps.

201
00:08:27,675 --> 00:08:31,078
Are you and Jared even now?

202
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:33,647
He made a mistake. So did you.

203
00:08:33,681 --> 00:08:35,182
Exactly what mistake did I make?

204
00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:37,317
This breach was your fault.

205
00:08:39,086 --> 00:08:42,122
Is that traumatic?

206
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:50,564
I had breakfast by myself.

207
00:08:50,598 --> 00:08:52,132
Where were you?

208
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:54,635
I'm sorry. Were we supposed to
have breakfast this morning?

209
00:08:54,668 --> 00:08:55,936
I had an early consult.

210
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:59,339
Yes, we always have breakfast
on Mondays.

211
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,574
We do?

212
00:09:00,608 --> 00:09:02,075
Every Monday.

213
00:09:02,109 --> 00:09:03,310
Every Monday.

214
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:05,145
Thank you.

215
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:09,082
Well, I guess our streak has
been broken then, huh?

216
00:09:09,116 --> 00:09:11,852
If someone punctures
the bronchus

217
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:15,155
during a routine bronchoscopy,
that's a mistake, right?

218
00:09:15,188 --> 00:09:17,925
Well, I can't imagine
how it wouldn't be.

219
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,660
Why? What did you do, Shaun?

220
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:23,130
I'm wondering if I need
to report Dr. Melendez.

221
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:24,965
Dr. Melendez did that?

222
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:27,034
The protocol is very clear.

223
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:30,137
I need to report it.

224
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:33,641
But I've seen how Jared
is being treated.

225
00:09:33,674 --> 00:09:37,010
Will Dr. Melendez treat me badly
if I report this?

226
00:09:38,946 --> 00:09:40,013
He shouldn't, obviously.

227
00:09:40,047 --> 00:09:43,283
But human nature being what...

228
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:45,252
Human nature?

229
00:09:47,688 --> 00:09:48,588
Shaun, you know what?

230
00:09:48,622 --> 00:09:51,391
You should make this decision
for yourself.

231
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:57,364
In fact... In fact...

232
00:09:57,397 --> 00:09:59,075
you should to make
all your decisions yourself

233
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:01,234
from here on in.

234
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:04,137
That's what we agreed on, right?

235
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,244
Have you considered

236
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:12,321
an endovascular embolization
procedure?

237
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:13,781
I have.

238
00:10:13,814 --> 00:10:14,882
It's a little less risky,

239
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:16,083
but I haven't done as many,

240
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,018
so I'm not sure which way
we're better off.

241
00:10:18,051 --> 00:10:19,687
You want me to check
the roster...

242
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,922
See if there's somebody
available with more experience?

243
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:25,425
I would like to assist, but yes.

244
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,060
Okay, here we go.

245
00:10:29,096 --> 00:10:30,297
No, he's not available.

246
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,899
So make him available.

247
00:10:31,932 --> 00:10:33,333
I got a husband and father

248
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,736
who presented with two aneurysms
in the last 12 hours.

249
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:37,705
I'd rather not.

250
00:10:37,738 --> 00:10:40,941
This particular surgeon
was recently...

251
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,010
transferred.

252
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,149
Not a chance.

253
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:52,753
Coyle is the best available
surgeon for the job.

254
00:10:52,786 --> 00:10:54,855
Coyle should've been fired,
and if he'd been fired,

255
00:10:54,888 --> 00:10:55,989
he wouldn't be available.

256
00:10:56,023 --> 00:10:57,100
And if he wasn't available,

257
00:10:57,124 --> 00:10:59,793
you would be the best person
for the job.

258
00:10:59,827 --> 00:11:01,895
Our ultimate duty is
to the patient.

259
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:07,067
No, it's not.

260
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,036
You agree he should
have been fired.

261
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:11,247
Of course. Even if he was the
best doctor in this hospital,

262
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:12,773
he should have been fired,
right?

263
00:11:12,806 --> 00:11:14,341
Yes.

264
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:16,309
So some things have
to matter more

265
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:18,846
than who is the most skilled.

266
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:21,281
If we forgive Coyle just because
he's good at something,

267
00:11:21,314 --> 00:11:24,251
what does he do next?

268
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:26,253
Either he matters or we matter.

269
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:39,332
Were you upset
during the procedure?

270
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:42,135
Did Murphy tell you
that I was "traumatized"?

271
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:43,880
You think that I might have
almost killed a person

272
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:45,038
because you dumped me?

273
00:11:45,072 --> 00:11:47,274
The fact that you're describing
it as "me dumping you"

274
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:50,043
suggests that you are upset.

275
00:11:50,077 --> 00:11:52,846
Look, I'm fine. You're fine.

276
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,981
Nobody's upset.

277
00:11:54,014 --> 00:11:55,916
Great.

278
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:57,384
But you do understand

279
00:11:57,417 --> 00:11:59,386
that I have to ask you
these questions,

280
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:00,988
that I need a statement
from you.

281
00:12:01,021 --> 00:12:02,990
Yes.

282
00:12:03,023 --> 00:12:04,825
Here's my statement...

283
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:06,126
"I wasn't distracted.

284
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:07,494
I didn't screw up."

285
00:12:07,527 --> 00:12:08,929
You get all that?

286
00:12:19,506 --> 00:12:21,050
Your bronchus was punctured
during the procedure,

287
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,309
but it's been repaired.

288
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:25,012
How? How could that happen?

289
00:12:25,045 --> 00:12:26,179
Why did you lie?

290
00:12:26,213 --> 00:12:28,248
You said that you inhaled smoke,

291
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:30,383
but there was no evidence
of smoke.

292
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:32,820
So, what do you gain
by lying to your doctors?

293
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:33,821
I wasn't lying.

294
00:12:33,854 --> 00:12:35,422
I was just...

295
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,224
confused, I guess.

296
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:38,558
I was in a lot of pain,

297
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,794
and it was all happening
so fast.

298
00:12:42,162 --> 00:12:43,363
My stomach!

299
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:45,532
Naja, what are you feeling?

300
00:12:45,565 --> 00:12:47,901
It's really sore and...
I feel like I'm going to...

301
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:51,138
Can we get some help over here?!

302
00:12:51,171 --> 00:12:53,874
Four milligrams of ondansetron.

303
00:12:53,907 --> 00:12:56,810
Airway inflammation,
abdominal pain, nausea.

304
00:12:56,844 --> 00:12:59,112
We need a full blood panel
and abdominal ultrasound.

305
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:05,518
The procedure will seal off
the aneurysm,

306
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:09,389
but there will almost certainly
be some brain damage...

307
00:13:09,422 --> 00:13:12,826
Anything from mild visual
or speech disturbances

308
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:16,496
to significant paralysis.

309
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:19,833
But without the surgery,
he'll die.

310
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:33,113
No. I-I won't consent
to the operation.

311
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:36,316
There really isn't
a lot of choice here.

312
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:37,517
Without the operation...

313
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:40,854
After his first stroke, it...

314
00:13:40,888 --> 00:13:44,524
It took him so long to recover.

315
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:49,362
It was frustrating
and painful for him.

316
00:13:49,396 --> 00:13:51,198
But he did recover.

317
00:13:55,635 --> 00:14:00,007
He made it clear he'd never want
to live compromised.

318
00:14:02,943 --> 00:14:04,411
Excuse me.

319
00:14:14,955 --> 00:14:18,025
Thank you for having breakfast
with me.

320
00:14:18,058 --> 00:14:19,893
My pleasure.

321
00:14:19,927 --> 00:14:22,229
People lie a lot, don't they?

322
00:14:22,262 --> 00:14:23,563
No, I-I meant it, Shaun.

323
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:24,607
I'm happy to spend time
with you.

324
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:28,068
There are seven reasons
that I've thought of.

325
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:31,271
There may even be more.

326
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:34,307
Do people ever lie
without a reason?

327
00:14:34,341 --> 00:14:35,575
No.

328
00:14:41,448 --> 00:14:44,051
Reason number six.
I think you just lied.

329
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:45,561
I think you just lied
to avoid something.

330
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:47,420
You don't like
this conversation.

331
00:14:47,454 --> 00:14:49,923
Shaun, n... Shaun, I'm sorry.

332
00:14:49,957 --> 00:14:52,492
I'm just...
Just a little distracted.

333
00:14:52,525 --> 00:14:53,927
My aneurysm patient...

334
00:14:53,961 --> 00:14:56,196
We're treating him
with blood-pressure meds

335
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:57,664
to try and avoid a rupture.

336
00:14:57,697 --> 00:15:00,934
You should do
an endovascular embolization.

337
00:15:00,968 --> 00:15:02,269
He doesn't want one.

338
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:03,546
It could leave him
with brain damage.

339
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,538
I thought he was unconscious.

340
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:07,407
He is.

341
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,576
His wife knows what he wants.

342
00:15:10,477 --> 00:15:12,712
It's amazing. I just...

343
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,215
I don't think
I'd be able to do that.

344
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:18,018
She's sacrificing her happiness,
her future,

345
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:19,119
just because she knows...

346
00:15:19,152 --> 00:15:20,453
She's lying.

347
00:15:20,487 --> 00:15:21,989
She's lying.

348
00:15:22,022 --> 00:15:25,325
It could be either
reason number four or...

349
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:26,998
No, she's not lying, Shaun.
She loves him.

350
00:15:27,027 --> 00:15:28,095
She doesn't love him.

351
00:15:28,128 --> 00:15:29,529
You haven't even met her!

352
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:31,607
You haven't seen what she's like
with him, with their son.

353
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:33,300
I'm not good at reading people.

354
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,735
Well, I am, and...
I think people-reading

355
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:38,571
embraces personal biases.

356
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:42,375
I think we should try
to avoid biases.

357
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:45,145
Knowledge of human behavior

358
00:15:45,178 --> 00:15:48,281
can help us make
informed, intuitive decisions.

359
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:50,283
Mm, my way is better.

360
00:15:50,317 --> 00:15:53,486
It's based on actions.
She's lying.

361
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,687
All right.

362
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:57,024
If you love someone,

363
00:15:57,057 --> 00:16:01,061
you'll do anything
to prevent their death.

364
00:16:07,234 --> 00:16:09,202
This... situation...

365
00:16:09,236 --> 00:16:12,539
There seems to be
a conflict of interest.

366
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:15,108
So I would like to bring in
someone else from legal

367
00:16:15,142 --> 00:16:17,044
to handle it.

368
00:16:17,077 --> 00:16:19,112
Yeah, I agree.

369
00:16:19,146 --> 00:16:21,548
You're an excellent lawyer,
but...

370
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:24,084
But what?

371
00:16:24,117 --> 00:16:25,418
Do you think this is my problem?

372
00:16:25,452 --> 00:16:27,120
It's understandable.

373
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:28,421
48 hours ago, we were engaged.

374
00:16:28,455 --> 00:16:30,057
And now, suddenly,

375
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:31,234
you're supposed to be
investigating me?

376
00:16:31,258 --> 00:16:33,093
Yes.

377
00:16:33,126 --> 00:16:34,127
And doing crazy things,

378
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:36,329
like expecting you
to give me complete answers

379
00:16:36,363 --> 00:16:37,764
to appropriate questions.

380
00:16:37,797 --> 00:16:40,300
You were trusting
Murphy's judgment over mine.

381
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,469
His judgment about my demeanor.

382
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,404
Seriously?

383
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:46,439
I asked you a question.

384
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:47,513
You wanted me to screw up.

385
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,109
You did screw up.

386
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:50,077
So what?

387
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:53,680
So we just deal with it.

388
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:56,216
But if you can't even admit that
you're not always perfect,

389
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:58,151
then I... I am not perfect!

390
00:17:01,088 --> 00:17:03,323
Clearly, I have made mistakes
in my life.

391
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:06,726
But not this time.

392
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:10,130
That punctured bronchus
was not my fault.

393
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:31,218
The nurse says his vital signs
are stable.

394
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:32,385
No change.

395
00:17:32,419 --> 00:17:33,720
Claire: That's good.

396
00:17:37,457 --> 00:17:39,259
It's...

397
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:42,695
such a great sacrifice

398
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:46,699
to respect his wishes enough
to let him go.

399
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:49,202
You must love your husband
very much.

400
00:18:00,713 --> 00:18:03,883
But...

401
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:07,154
there could be
another explanation.

402
00:18:07,187 --> 00:18:11,691
Either you love him enough
to let him die...

403
00:18:11,724 --> 00:18:16,129
or you hate him enough
to let him die.

404
00:18:16,163 --> 00:18:19,832
You don't know
what you're talking about.

405
00:18:19,866 --> 00:18:24,637
There's a doctor here
who harassed me.

406
00:18:24,671 --> 00:18:27,374
He made me feel vulnerable,
worthless...

407
00:18:27,407 --> 00:18:31,778
Neither of which I am.

408
00:18:31,811 --> 00:18:35,882
But he never hurt me.

409
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:40,620
I can't imagine how I would feel
if he did,

410
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:43,590
what I would do,

411
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:46,259
what I would want to do to him.

412
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:51,264
What did your husband do to you?

413
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:57,270
He's a good father.

414
00:18:57,304 --> 00:18:59,439
No, he's not.

415
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:01,774
A good father doesn't
hurt a mother.

416
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,443
Payton loves him.

417
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:04,344
All the more reason...

418
00:19:04,377 --> 00:19:05,845
No.

419
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:08,915
Payton doesn't know anything.
He never can.

420
00:19:08,948 --> 00:19:11,751
I know you're afraid
he'll come after you,

421
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:14,854
but there are people
who can help.

422
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:29,445
Payton is better off with
the memory of a loving father

423
00:19:29,469 --> 00:19:30,803
than the truth.

424
00:19:37,244 --> 00:19:40,380
Let him die.

425
00:19:47,954 --> 00:19:52,325
Methanol is causing
her abdominal pain.

426
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:53,960
She drank wood alcohol?

427
00:19:53,993 --> 00:19:55,037
People drink whatever
they can drink.

428
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:57,364
Well, she's Muslim...
Wouldn't let me touch her.

429
00:19:57,397 --> 00:19:59,466
Religious people aren't
immune to hypocrisy.

430
00:19:59,499 --> 00:20:03,603
There are other ways to explain
the presence of methanol.

431
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:05,505
It's also produced by the liver

432
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:08,275
when the body is exposed
to certain caustic chemicals.

433
00:20:08,308 --> 00:20:11,311
If inhaled, caustic chemicals
could also inflame the lungs.

434
00:20:11,344 --> 00:20:13,246
And caustic chemicals also burn,

435
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,781
so it would explain
all her symptoms.

436
00:20:14,814 --> 00:20:16,283
Do you happen to have a list

437
00:20:16,316 --> 00:20:17,526
of which caustic chemicals
do all that?

438
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,986
Dimethyl sulfate...

439
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:22,589
It's used in
the pharmaceutical industry.

440
00:20:22,622 --> 00:20:24,357
She's a school teacher.
It's also used

441
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:26,526
in water treatment,
industrial pesticides,

442
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:27,927
and chemical weapons.

443
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,562
She has no reason to be involved

444
00:20:29,596 --> 00:20:31,598
with water treatment
or industrial pesticides.

445
00:20:31,631 --> 00:20:33,733
But she could
be a school teacher

446
00:20:33,766 --> 00:20:34,834
and a terrorist.

447
00:20:44,311 --> 00:20:44,944
So, what do we do? The surgery.

448
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:46,779
We don't have her consent.

449
00:20:46,813 --> 00:20:49,048
Technically, the issue is
we don't have his consent.

450
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,484
We go to his wife
because we can't get his,

451
00:20:51,518 --> 00:20:52,861
the assumption being that
she's operating

452
00:20:52,885 --> 00:20:54,321
in his best interests.

453
00:20:54,354 --> 00:20:57,557
Pretty sure that's not
happening here.

454
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,934
Go back to the wife,
get her to change her mind,

455
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:00,960
or we'll take it to court.

456
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:02,962
Okay.

457
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:04,464
Hey, you look annoyed.

458
00:21:04,497 --> 00:21:05,898
I'm annoyed
we're sending him home

459
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:07,534
to keep abusing his wife.

460
00:21:07,567 --> 00:21:09,769
She's a world-class liar.

461
00:21:09,802 --> 00:21:11,780
I mean, for all we know,
she wants her husband dead

462
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:13,973
so that she can run off
with her Pilates instructor.

463
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:15,908
I'll get the consent.

464
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:17,310
Thank you.

465
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:24,817
She refused initial treatment
for methanol toxicity.

466
00:21:24,851 --> 00:21:25,818
It's ethanol...

467
00:21:25,852 --> 00:21:27,463
Because she's Muslim,
she can't consume it.

468
00:21:27,487 --> 00:21:29,589
Shaun: She has alcohol
in her system

469
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:31,634
but won't let us put alcohol
in her system to treat it,

470
00:21:31,658 --> 00:21:33,560
because she doesn't want alcohol
in her system.

471
00:21:33,593 --> 00:21:35,895
We put her on fomepi...
Dr. Murphy...

472
00:21:35,928 --> 00:21:37,806
Is this part of your evidence
that she's a terrorist?

473
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,699
Because she's Muslim?

474
00:21:39,732 --> 00:21:41,644
There are billions of Muslims
that aren't terrorists.

475
00:21:41,668 --> 00:21:44,704
Is that part of your evidence
that she's not?

476
00:21:44,737 --> 00:21:47,073
I think she's a terrorist
because it's the easiest way

477
00:21:47,106 --> 00:21:48,875
to explain her symptoms
and her lie.

478
00:21:48,908 --> 00:21:51,043
Do you have a way?

479
00:21:51,077 --> 00:21:53,613
She had an accident.
It scared her.

480
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:54,514
Maybe we scare her.

481
00:21:54,547 --> 00:21:56,783
Hell, maybe this whole place
scares her.

482
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:58,694
There are a lot of reasons
people don't tell the truth

483
00:21:58,718 --> 00:21:59,862
other than criminal activity.

484
00:21:59,886 --> 00:22:01,654
Six other reasons.

485
00:22:01,688 --> 00:22:04,090
If a person comes in
with a gunshot wound,

486
00:22:04,123 --> 00:22:05,825
we have to report it.

487
00:22:05,858 --> 00:22:07,360
Why don't we have to report

488
00:22:07,394 --> 00:22:09,004
someone who might be making
chemical weapons?

489
00:22:09,028 --> 00:22:12,665
Because unfounded accusations
can destroy people's lives.

490
00:22:12,699 --> 00:22:15,368
What does it matter
what people speculate

491
00:22:15,402 --> 00:22:16,803
as long as the truth comes out?

492
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:18,405
Because people
make up their minds

493
00:22:18,438 --> 00:22:19,539
before the truth comes out.

494
00:22:19,572 --> 00:22:21,541
Says the guy who played
the race card

495
00:22:21,574 --> 00:22:22,742
when he needed an advantage.

496
00:22:22,775 --> 00:22:24,644
Even if you're right,

497
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:27,514
she's not making bombs
while she's in our ICU.

498
00:22:27,547 --> 00:22:29,782
Also, you're wrong.
Now, keep me posted.

499
00:22:29,816 --> 00:22:31,851
If she's not better
in the next two hours,

500
00:22:31,884 --> 00:22:33,853
I want to know.

501
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:47,900
We need you to consent
to your husband's surgery.

502
00:22:50,537 --> 00:22:52,371
I said "no."

503
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:58,445
There's a better way, Tessa.

504
00:22:58,478 --> 00:23:00,112
Leave him.

505
00:23:00,146 --> 00:23:02,682
Start a new life.

506
00:23:08,755 --> 00:23:09,956
I'm afraid.

507
00:23:09,989 --> 00:23:11,491
I know.

508
00:23:11,524 --> 00:23:14,193
But... this...

509
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:17,630
This isn't the answer.

510
00:23:17,664 --> 00:23:19,666
If you don't consent,

511
00:23:19,699 --> 00:23:20,743
we'll take this to the court,

512
00:23:20,767 --> 00:23:23,803
and we'll tell a judge
what we know.

513
00:23:23,836 --> 00:23:26,172
I told you those things
in confidence.

514
00:23:26,205 --> 00:23:28,207
You are not my patient.
Your husband is.

515
00:23:30,843 --> 00:23:33,513
Two things will happen.

516
00:23:33,546 --> 00:23:35,181
We wil get the consent,

517
00:23:35,214 --> 00:23:37,517
and Payton will find out
the truth.

518
00:24:10,983 --> 00:24:14,220
Tessa?

519
00:24:14,253 --> 00:24:18,558
You are stronger than
you think you are.

520
00:24:38,778 --> 00:24:41,914
Your methanol toxicity
is abating...

521
00:24:41,948 --> 00:24:43,850
The treatment's working.

522
00:24:43,883 --> 00:24:46,085
Great.

523
00:24:46,118 --> 00:24:49,689
Um... do you think that
I'll be able to leave soon?

524
00:24:49,722 --> 00:24:51,858
All of your symptoms
are consistent

525
00:24:51,891 --> 00:24:54,126
with exposure
to dimethyl sulfate.

526
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,129
I... I've never heard
of dimethyl...

527
00:24:57,163 --> 00:25:01,000
Dimethyl sulfate is used
to make chemical weapons.

528
00:25:07,774 --> 00:25:11,611
I didn't expect this from you.

529
00:25:11,644 --> 00:25:14,681
I made a statement.

530
00:25:14,714 --> 00:25:17,049
You're different.

531
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:19,151
I have autism.

532
00:25:19,185 --> 00:25:21,253
You've experienced bigotry.

533
00:25:21,287 --> 00:25:24,857
Yes.

534
00:25:24,891 --> 00:25:29,829
Have... people refused
to serve you?

535
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:32,899
Have you seen people

536
00:25:32,932 --> 00:25:35,001
change their flight

537
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:37,970
because of you?

538
00:25:38,004 --> 00:25:39,238
Have people cursed you out

539
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:41,774
before you've opened your mouth?

540
00:25:44,343 --> 00:25:46,613
I'm not prejudiced.

541
00:25:46,646 --> 00:25:48,615
I have evidence.

542
00:25:48,648 --> 00:25:51,350
Nobody's prejudiced.

543
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:54,587
Everybody has evidence.

544
00:25:54,621 --> 00:25:57,223
And I'm always brown.

545
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,160
Maybe you're not so different.

546
00:26:05,164 --> 00:26:08,768
You're sweating.

547
00:26:08,801 --> 00:26:11,137
Perspiration is a sign
of dishonesty.

548
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,908
My chest.

549
00:26:15,942 --> 00:26:18,210
Chest pain can be brought on
by anxiety.

550
00:26:19,979 --> 00:26:22,649
Oh, but this time,
you are having a heart attack.

551
00:26:22,682 --> 00:26:24,316
EKG, stat!

552
00:26:27,286 --> 00:26:29,956
The endothelial lining
had moderate inflammation

553
00:26:29,989 --> 00:26:31,323
that appeared acute,

554
00:26:31,357 --> 00:26:34,060
and there was evidence
of mucosal edema.

555
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:35,828
I made no extraordinary motions,

556
00:26:35,862 --> 00:26:38,164
nor did I apply
any unnecessary force.

557
00:26:38,197 --> 00:26:40,199
And yet, the bronchus
was punctured.

558
00:26:40,232 --> 00:26:41,934
Which is a risk,
albeit a small one,

559
00:26:41,968 --> 00:26:43,269
with this kind of procedure.

560
00:26:45,772 --> 00:26:46,806
Well...

561
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:48,641
thank you.

562
00:26:48,675 --> 00:26:50,877
I appreciate the thoroughness
of your answers.

563
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:53,179
Not sure I understood it all...

564
00:26:53,212 --> 00:26:57,016
but I think
I've got what I need.

565
00:26:57,049 --> 00:27:00,352
I probably shouldn't
say anything,

566
00:27:00,386 --> 00:27:01,788
but I know you and Ms. Preston

567
00:27:01,821 --> 00:27:03,131
are going through something
right now.

568
00:27:03,155 --> 00:27:04,423
That really wasn't relevant.

569
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,893
Oh, I-I know. I know.
It's just...

570
00:27:08,394 --> 00:27:11,731
I know she'll get through it,
but...

571
00:27:11,764 --> 00:27:14,667
it's good you're
handling it better.

572
00:27:14,701 --> 00:27:17,804
It's one thing to be distracted
while drafting a contract

573
00:27:17,837 --> 00:27:20,840
and a whole other thing entirely
doing what you do.

574
00:27:31,851 --> 00:27:33,953
Inject dye.

575
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:36,989
Injecting dye.

576
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:42,661
Hanging a left
at the vertebral artery.

577
00:27:45,965 --> 00:27:49,301
Okay, withdrawing
the guide wire.

578
00:27:49,335 --> 00:27:50,970
Inserting the platinum matrix.

579
00:27:55,742 --> 00:27:58,210
You know, sometimes,
you do the right thing

580
00:27:58,244 --> 00:28:00,379
and things get a little better.

581
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:02,715
And sometimes,
things still suck.

582
00:28:06,052 --> 00:28:10,790
Entering the aneurysm.

583
00:28:10,823 --> 00:28:12,224
Okay.

584
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:14,260
Blood pressure's spiking.

585
00:28:14,293 --> 00:28:15,261
Wait, why?

586
00:28:15,294 --> 00:28:17,129
There's no rupture, no bleeding,

587
00:28:17,163 --> 00:28:18,397
no stroke.

588
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:21,400
If his BP goes up any higher,
he will have a stroke.

589
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:23,135
I'm terminating the procedure.

590
00:28:23,169 --> 00:28:26,138
Push 20 milligrams
of labetalol, stat.

591
00:28:33,512 --> 00:28:35,057
We need to stabilize him before
we can retry the procedure,

592
00:28:35,081 --> 00:28:37,216
which means we need
to figure out what we missed.

593
00:28:37,249 --> 00:28:39,051
This wasn't our fault.

594
00:28:39,085 --> 00:28:41,287
His BP was stable going in.

595
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,889
He's been on
calcium-channel blockers

596
00:28:42,922 --> 00:28:44,432
for the last six years.
Well, we missed something.

597
00:28:44,456 --> 00:28:48,194
BP doesn't skyrocket
for no reason.

598
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:49,361
Run a full work-up.

599
00:28:52,364 --> 00:28:54,500
Why would a 28-year-old
with no risk factors

600
00:28:54,533 --> 00:28:56,135
have a heart attack?

601
00:28:56,168 --> 00:28:57,269
Hmm.

602
00:28:57,303 --> 00:29:00,072
Her heart is burning.

603
00:29:00,106 --> 00:29:01,240
Burning?

604
00:29:01,273 --> 00:29:03,375
From the caustic chemical!

605
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:06,412
Murphy. It's going
through her system.

606
00:29:06,445 --> 00:29:08,881
Unlike thermal burns,

607
00:29:08,915 --> 00:29:11,050
chemical burns
get worse over time.

608
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:14,220
And it also explains
the punctured bronchus.

609
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:16,522
The caustic chemical
thinned the bronchial walls.

610
00:29:16,555 --> 00:29:18,390
You did not make a mistake.

611
00:29:18,424 --> 00:29:20,026
That's not the only explanation.

612
00:29:21,327 --> 00:29:22,995
But I'll shut up now.

613
00:29:23,029 --> 00:29:24,239
You think you have a good idea,

614
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:26,933
but you're going
to shut yourself up?

615
00:29:26,966 --> 00:29:29,235
It could be caused
by an infection

616
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:32,839
from bacteria that leaked
as a result of the puncture.

617
00:29:32,872 --> 00:29:36,408
The treatments are
diametrically opposed...

618
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:39,011
Antibiotics if it's infection,

619
00:29:39,045 --> 00:29:41,147
steroids if it's inflammation.

620
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:44,150
If she needs antibiotics
and she needs steroids instead,

621
00:29:44,183 --> 00:29:45,427
it will suppress
her immune system,

622
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:47,820
causing the infection
to flourish and kill her.

623
00:29:47,854 --> 00:29:49,421
If she needs steroids

624
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:51,257
and we give her antibiotics,
then...

625
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,458
I get it.

626
00:29:52,491 --> 00:29:53,425
We'd better be right.

627
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:55,227
Yes.

628
00:29:55,261 --> 00:29:57,930
Sir, I think we should bring
another senior attending in

629
00:29:57,964 --> 00:30:00,099
to consult on this decision.
Why?

630
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:02,168
Because if Shaun's right,
you're exonerated.

631
00:30:02,201 --> 00:30:03,511
And if I'm right,
you may have made the mistake

632
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:06,005
that could kill this woman.

633
00:30:06,038 --> 00:30:08,007
You don't think
I can be objective?

634
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,042
I think you're incredibly
professional...

635
00:30:10,076 --> 00:30:11,076
Shut up, Jared.

636
00:30:14,947 --> 00:30:21,320
It is possible that
I screwed up.

637
00:30:21,353 --> 00:30:23,289
Let's put her on
broad-spectrum antibiotics.

638
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:25,424
You're wrong.

639
00:30:25,457 --> 00:30:27,026
Making a decision

640
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:29,095
on the assumption
you made a mistake

641
00:30:29,128 --> 00:30:29,996
is a mistake.

642
00:30:30,029 --> 00:30:33,599
You're very arrogant.

643
00:30:33,632 --> 00:30:35,968
It helps you be a great surgeon.

644
00:30:38,204 --> 00:30:40,306
Fortunately, I don't need
your approval.

645
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:54,220
We've determined what
the underlying problem was.

646
00:30:54,253 --> 00:30:56,031
What caused your husband's
aneurysm to rupture

647
00:30:56,055 --> 00:30:58,424
and why his blood pressure
spiked in the O.R.

648
00:30:58,457 --> 00:31:01,193
According to his labs,
he hasn't been taking his meds.

649
00:31:01,227 --> 00:31:03,029
As far as I know, he has.

650
00:31:03,062 --> 00:31:05,297
I mean, that's just
not like him.

651
00:31:05,331 --> 00:31:07,934
We don't think it's like him,
either.

652
00:31:10,602 --> 00:31:13,906
You think I had something
to do with this?

653
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:16,375
That I, what,
threw his meds away?

654
00:31:16,408 --> 00:31:20,146
He'd just order more.

655
00:31:20,179 --> 00:31:23,482
But if you emptied his capsules
and filled them with sugar...

656
00:31:23,515 --> 00:31:26,185
Or, even better, salt...

657
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:28,220
It would end your nightmare.

658
00:31:31,157 --> 00:31:33,525
I was willing to let him die,

659
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:39,465
but I could never...

660
00:31:39,498 --> 00:31:43,335
If I were strong enough
to kill him...

661
00:31:54,213 --> 00:31:56,382
Is there a chance
your son knows more

662
00:31:56,415 --> 00:31:58,384
than you think he does?

663
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:21,040
Her heart rate's 90.

664
00:32:21,073 --> 00:32:22,975
That's in the normal range.

665
00:32:23,009 --> 00:32:25,477
But it was 83.
It should be going down.

666
00:32:25,511 --> 00:32:28,180
All her other signs are normal.

667
00:32:28,214 --> 00:32:31,150
You were right.
This is the proper treatment.

668
00:32:31,183 --> 00:32:32,318
95.

669
00:32:36,055 --> 00:32:38,124
I'm switching her to steroids.

670
00:32:38,157 --> 00:32:39,992
If we give her steroids,

671
00:32:40,026 --> 00:32:42,194
it will suppress
her immune system,

672
00:32:42,228 --> 00:32:43,305
causing the infection
to flourish...

673
00:32:43,329 --> 00:32:45,207
I'm going to push 40 milligrams
of methylprednisolone.

674
00:32:45,231 --> 00:32:46,365
And she'll die.

675
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,635
This is on me.

676
00:32:49,668 --> 00:32:51,437
I know.

677
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:03,115
We switched her
to methylprednisolone.

678
00:33:03,149 --> 00:33:04,250
It's working.

679
00:33:04,283 --> 00:33:05,717
You were wrong.

680
00:33:05,751 --> 00:33:07,386
Yeah, I got that.

681
00:33:07,419 --> 00:33:09,788
Just about the treatment choice.

682
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:10,622
You didn't do anything wrong
in the O.R.

683
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:12,324
Don't kiss my ass.

684
00:33:12,358 --> 00:33:17,296
Jared saved her life.

685
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:19,531
If he hadn't acted so quickly,
she would've died,

686
00:33:19,565 --> 00:33:22,268
and that would've been
your fault.

687
00:33:22,301 --> 00:33:23,335
Yes, it would've.

688
00:33:23,369 --> 00:33:24,470
You should thank him.

689
00:33:32,211 --> 00:33:34,080
Thank you, Dr. Kalu.

690
00:34:29,168 --> 00:34:29,768
Hey.

691
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:31,203
Can I help you?

692
00:34:31,237 --> 00:34:34,106
I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.

693
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:37,809
You're my new neighbor,
number 34.

694
00:34:37,843 --> 00:34:40,279
Yeah, cool.

695
00:34:40,312 --> 00:34:42,248
Uh, you wanna come in
for a beer?

696
00:34:42,281 --> 00:34:43,415
No.

697
00:34:51,457 --> 00:34:53,392
Nice work.

698
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:54,660
You, too.

699
00:34:54,693 --> 00:34:57,496
You can have the honors.

700
00:34:59,198 --> 00:35:00,775
This is the first time
I'm not looking forward

701
00:35:00,799 --> 00:35:03,269
to telling the family
it went well.

702
00:35:30,229 --> 00:35:32,198
You're going to be fine.

703
00:35:32,231 --> 00:35:34,533
The treatment worked?

704
00:35:34,566 --> 00:35:37,436
The second one did.
The first one almost killed you.

705
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:39,605
The fact that you're alive
right now is evidence

706
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:41,349
that you were working
with dimethyl sulfate.

707
00:35:41,373 --> 00:35:45,944
You're a terrorist, aren't you?

708
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:49,515
My brother works
for a drug company.

709
00:35:49,548 --> 00:35:52,518
They use dimethyl sulfate to
make one of their medications.

710
00:35:52,551 --> 00:35:53,952
He stole some for me.

711
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:56,522
So you could make
a chemical weapon.

712
00:35:56,555 --> 00:36:02,961
So I could make perfume.

713
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,196
Smell that.

714
00:36:17,309 --> 00:36:20,512
It's... beautiful.

715
00:36:20,546 --> 00:36:21,880
But very stupid.

716
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:23,915
Yeah.

717
00:36:23,949 --> 00:36:26,552
Especially since my brother
would get fired

718
00:36:26,585 --> 00:36:27,753
if anyone ever found out.

719
00:36:29,888 --> 00:36:30,822
You believe her?

720
00:36:30,856 --> 00:36:32,958
Protecting someone...

721
00:36:32,991 --> 00:36:34,993
Reason number three.

722
00:36:37,563 --> 00:36:40,366
So... we good?

723
00:36:40,399 --> 00:36:42,534
Thing is, I'm not sure
it really matters.

724
00:36:42,568 --> 00:36:44,412
I've been told I can only have
three residents next year.

725
00:36:44,436 --> 00:36:45,404
That's great.

726
00:36:45,437 --> 00:36:46,838
Not really.

727
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:49,575
Because of Coyle's transfer,
I have to take on his.

728
00:36:49,608 --> 00:36:51,910
Reznick?

729
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:54,513
She's a pain.

730
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:56,848
Pain can be a hell of motivator.

731
00:36:56,882 --> 00:36:57,882
Good luck.

732
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:05,757
You were right.

733
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:12,631
And I think you were right that
I wanted you to be wrong.

734
00:37:12,664 --> 00:37:15,401
And I'm sorry.

735
00:37:15,434 --> 00:37:18,604
You were right, too.

736
00:37:18,637 --> 00:37:22,441
I kept telling myself that
I'm fine, but...

737
00:37:22,474 --> 00:37:24,009
it's been hard.

738
00:37:24,042 --> 00:37:25,877
Got me second-guessing myself,

739
00:37:25,911 --> 00:37:28,514
maybe affecting my judgment.

740
00:37:28,547 --> 00:37:31,317
I don't know.

741
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:33,952
If we're hurting so bad,
maybe we made a mistake.

742
00:37:36,655 --> 00:37:38,056
No.

743
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,459
It just means that
what we had mattered.

744
00:37:40,492 --> 00:37:43,695
Doesn't mean that it was right.

745
00:37:43,729 --> 00:37:46,398
I've also been thinking that...

746
00:37:46,432 --> 00:37:48,700
arrogance does make me
a better surgeon.

747
00:37:51,036 --> 00:37:52,756
But it's not gonna make me
a better husband.

748
00:37:55,707 --> 00:37:57,943
I'm sorry.

749
00:38:10,088 --> 00:38:12,491
Kristin?

750
00:38:12,524 --> 00:38:13,925
Hey, I'm Claire.

751
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:15,361
Hi.

752
00:38:15,394 --> 00:38:18,964
Thanks.

753
00:38:18,997 --> 00:38:20,599
Um,

754
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:26,037
I am doing some research
on Dr. Coyle...

755
00:38:26,071 --> 00:38:30,709
On the women who worked with him
and then quit.

756
00:38:30,742 --> 00:38:36,415
I got another offer at SF Muni.

757
00:38:36,448 --> 00:38:40,786
I was harassed by Dr. Coyle.

758
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:42,754
And I think you were, too.

759
00:38:55,667 --> 00:39:01,072
Doing the right thing can make
things a little better...

760
00:39:01,106 --> 00:39:03,609
especially if we do it together.

761
00:39:25,531 --> 00:39:27,966
I have a new neighbor.

762
00:39:27,999 --> 00:39:32,404
Hmm. So, Lea's really gone, huh?

763
00:39:32,438 --> 00:39:35,474
So, can we have breakfast
tomorrow?

764
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:39,678
I'd love to, Shaun, but...

765
00:39:42,814 --> 00:39:44,716
we, um...

766
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:46,151
We talked about this, right?

767
00:39:46,184 --> 00:39:49,120
I-I said that I would

768
00:39:49,154 --> 00:39:51,690
back off if you stayed, right?

769
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:52,691
More space, less "fathering."

770
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:53,992
I don't need a father.

771
00:39:54,025 --> 00:39:55,694
I hate fathers.

772
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:56,662
Right, so...

773
00:39:56,695 --> 00:39:58,564
I need a friend.

774
00:40:03,502 --> 00:40:07,105
Shaun, I-I am someone
who can't help

775
00:40:07,138 --> 00:40:08,874
but give advice, you know?

776
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:12,410
I don't know
if I can not do that.

777
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:18,684
So you think I can change
and you can't?

778
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:24,155
I think that we have
a certain kind of relationship.

779
00:40:24,189 --> 00:40:26,858
And we can call it something
different if we want,

780
00:40:26,892 --> 00:40:29,595
but we can't magically
make it different.

781
00:40:29,628 --> 00:40:31,597
You said that you wanted space.

782
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:33,632
You said that you needed space.

783
00:40:39,905 --> 00:40:45,243
I-I think you should
be my friend.

784
00:40:50,682 --> 00:40:52,150
Shaun...

785
00:41:06,632 --> 00:41:07,899
Okay.

786
00:41:11,269 --> 00:41:13,171
Shaun?

787
00:41:59,785 --> 00:42:04,055
What are you smelling right now?

788
00:42:04,089 --> 00:42:05,757
Pine trees.

789
00:42:07,959 --> 00:42:09,127
Mmm.
