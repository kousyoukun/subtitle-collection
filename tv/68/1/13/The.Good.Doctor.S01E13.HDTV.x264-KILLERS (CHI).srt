There are other ways to explain
the presence of methanol.

476
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,780
It's also produced by the liver

477
00:20:01,782 --> 00:20:04,350
when the body is exposed
to certain caustic chemicals.

478
00:20:04,352 --> 00:20:07,553
If inhaled, caustic chemicals
could also inflame the lungs.

479
00:20:07,555 --> 00:20:09,488
And caustic chemicals also burn,

all her symptoms.

If she needs antibiotics
