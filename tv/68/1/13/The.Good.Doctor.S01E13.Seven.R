00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,390
-我來晚了  -沒事  寶貝  不怪你
- I was late! - It's okay, sweetie. It's not your fault.

21
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:37,020
我只想在蓋瑞家再玩把游戲
I just wanted to play one more game at Gary's.

22
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,480
你做得很好  立即打了急救電話
Well, you did great. You called 911 right away.

23
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,230
-他好像死了  -爸爸沒死
- He looked dead. - Daddy's not dead.

24
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:42,740
他會沒事的  對吧
He's gonna be okay, right?

25
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,470
-他中風了  -不可能
- He had a stroke. - That's not possible!

26
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:46,350
CT掃描證實動脈瘤破裂了
Well, the CT confirmed a ruptured aneurysm.

27
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:47,860
得做手術止血
We have to operate to clip the bleeding

28
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:48,830
釋放顱內壓
and reduce intracranial pressure.

29
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:50,680
不  他六年前中過風
No, he had a stroke six years ago.

30
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,250
當時用了地爾硫卓
They put him on diltiazem.

31
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,610
我們會救治你爸爸的
We're gonna take good care of your dad.

32
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,710
納吉·莫迪  28歲  左手有燒傷
Naja Modi -- 28 years old, suffered a burn to her left hand

33
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,840
煮飯時不小心傷到的
as a result of a cooking accident.

34
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,890
我和杰瑞德是在受罰嗎
Are Jared and I being punished?

35
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:10,950
這個病例沒什么意思吧
This is not a very interesting case, is it?

36
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:12,040
第一
Lesson one --

37
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,480
別在外科主任面前說
Don't suggest to the the head of surgery

38
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,660
跟著外科主任干活
that working with the head of surgery

39
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:17,920
就是在受罰
is form of punishment.

40
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,730
梅倫德斯醫生非常不滿意
Dr. Melendez is very unhappy with Jared

41
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:23,410
杰瑞德是如何回來工作的
for how he got his job back.

42
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:26,890
梅倫德斯醫生也非常不滿意我...
And Dr. Melendez is unhappy with me for t-taking --

43
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:28,440
休了兩天假
taking two days off.

44
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,140
我覺得他不想談這事  肖恩
I don't think he wants to talk about this, Shaun.

45
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:36,750
我太蠢了
I was an idiot.

46
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,450
在爐子上啊  肯定很燙
It's on the stove. Of course it's hot, right?

47
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,870
你肯定不相信我們見過多少這種事故
You wouldn't believe how often we see these types of accidents.

48
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:43,750
那蠢貨還挺多的
Well, there are a lot of idiots.

49
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,720
現在要怎么處理  莫菲
Okay, what do we need to do here, Murphy?

50
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,410
表面二度燒傷
A superficial partial-thickness burn

51
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:50,070
可以保守處理
should be managed conservatively.

52
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,220
清理燒傷區域  用柔軟的紗布清創
Cleanse the area, debride with soft gauze,

53
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,770
用抗菌原油敷料包好
and then cover with an antimicrobial petroleum dressing.

54
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:56,890
也就是說
All of which means,

55
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:59,050
留個小疤就會好了
this should heal with minimal scarring.

56
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,380
納吉  你胸口疼嗎
Naja, are you having chest pain?

57
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,260
我好像心臟病發了
I think I'm having a heart attack.

58
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,510
呼吸困難
It's hard to breathe.

59
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:07,240
盡可能放松
Just relax if you can.

60
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,210
給她輸氧  做12導聯心電圖
Put her on oxygen, a 12 lead EKG,

61
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:11,510
并安排床邊胸部X光片
and order a portable chest X-ray.

62
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:12,540
莫菲  走吧  快
Murphy, let's move. Come on.

63
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,920
她的生命體征很穩定
Her vitals are stable.

64
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:18,680
到底怎么回事
What the hell is going on here?

65
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,980
不知道
I don't know.

66
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,430
但很有意思
But it is interesting.

67
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,030
蛛網膜下腔出血  抽吸
We've got a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Suction.

68
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:39,850
得隔離動脈瘤
I need to isolate the aneurysm.

69
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,530
可憐的孩子
Poor kid.

70
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,900
想象發現自己的爸爸成這樣了
Imagine finding your dad like that.

71
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:47,140
我倒是真想那樣死掉
Well, that's exactly how I want to die.

72
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,310
如果他父親沒挺下來
If the dad doesn't make it,

73
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,160
孩子會永遠記得那個畫面
the kid will always remember that moment --

74
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,340
留下心理創傷
be traumatized by it.

75
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,470
因為他愛他
Because he loves him.

76
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,190
沒有任何人因自己的死而傷心...
The idea of dying without anybody getting hurt --

77
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:00,000
最令人悲傷的莫過于空蕩蕩的等候室
There's nothing sadder than an empty waiting room.

78
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,370
好  看到了什么
Okay, what do you see?

79
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,510
前交通動脈上有個腫塊
A bulge on the anterior communicating artery.

80
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:09,460
對  破裂的動脈瘤中斷了
Yeah, the ruptured aneurysm is compromising

81
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,950
大腦額葉的供血
blood flow to the frontal lobe.

82
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,110
準備十一毫米的止血鉗
Prep an 11 millimeter standard clip.

83
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:14,560
你結婚了嗎
Are you married?

84
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,660
離了
Not anymore.

85
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,310
原來他比我還沒眼光
Turns out he had even worse judgment than I did.

86
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:21,380
說到變態  你知道科利被調走了嗎
Oh, speaking of creeps, you hear Coyle got transferred?

87
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:23,550
他被調走真是太好了
I'm so glad they shut him down.

88
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,010
是啊  我想也是
Well, yeah, I guess.

89
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:28,440
真希望他們把錢用在買小兒創傷艙上
Just wish they'd spent the money on a Pediatric Trauma Pod.

90
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,330
他升職了
They gave him a raise.

91
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:34,910
止血鉗
Clip.

92
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,310
心電圖證實
The EKG confirmed

93
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,100
你當時沒有心臟病發作
you weren't having a heart attack.

94
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,570
我不是裝的
I-I wasn't faking.

95
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:42,820
我不會那么做
I wouldn't do that.

96
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:43,720
我們知道
We know.

97
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,300
圖像也證實了
The imaging also confirmed

98
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,120
你的肺部炎癥很嚴重
that you have considerable lung inflammation.

99
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,630
你會不會吸到了煙
Is it possible you inhaled smoke?

100
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,250
肯定是吸到了
I guess I must have.

101
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,380
當時油脂引起了一場小火
There was a minor grease fire.

102
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:53,360
現在怎么辦
What happens now?

103
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,910
你得做支氣管鏡檢查
You need a bronchoscopy.

104
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:57,280
要從你的喉部插入窺鏡檢查損傷情況
We put a camera down your throat to see how much damage there is

105
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,810
看看該如何修復
and what we need to do to repair it.

106
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,030
別擔心  會給你麻醉的
But don't worry. You'll be sedated.

107
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:01,930
不要
Please don't.

108
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:03,500
抱歉
Oh, I'm -- I'm sorry.

109
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,290
必須做檢查
The test is absolutely necessary.

110
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:06,550
檢查沒問題
The test is fine.

111
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,570
但是
But, um...

112
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:10,540
請別碰我  除非是治療必須的
please don't touch me, except for medical purposes.

113
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,540
當然
Yeah, of course.

114
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,280
沒道理啊
That does not make sense.

115
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,110
很多宗教信仰對觸碰都有規矩的
A number of religions have rules about touching.

116
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,060
我不太理解  但
I don't quite get it, but --

117
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,440
這有道理
That makes sense.

118
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,990
除非有很合理的原因
People shouldn't touch people

119
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:28,900
是不該觸碰他人
unless there's a very good reason.

120
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,750
好  那么...
Okay, then...

121
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,010
是什么沒道理
what doesn't make sense?

122
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,690
油脂起火
The grease fire.

123
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:37,050
油脂起火能解釋所有情況
The grease fire explains the whole thing --

124
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,390
燒傷  煙
the burn, the smoke.

125
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:42,020
她說她忘了爐子很燙
She told us she forgot the stove was hot.

126
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,680
如果有東西著火了
How can you forget something's hot

127
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,140
怎么會忘了很燙
when it is on fire?

128
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,790
肖恩  如果她不是突然以為心臟病發了
Shaun, I'm sure we would have heard more of the story

129
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,900
我們肯定能聽到更多內容
if she hadn't suddenly thought she was having a heart attack.

130
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:57,660
你為什么不炒了他
Why didn't you fire him?

131
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:59,400
因為他的說辭跟你的不一樣
Because his story was different than yours.

132
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,720
而你信了他的說辭
And you believe his story?

133
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,590
我信了你的
I believe your story.

134
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,640
但你沒證據
But you can't prove it.

135
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,210
而我們不能簡單一味地
And we simply can't make a policy

136
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:10,890
相信每個申訴男人的女人
of believing every woman who files a complaint against every man.

137
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,720
數千年來女人的申訴一直不被信任
After a few thousand years of doing the opposite,

138
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,530
如今矯枉過正又有何不妥
it wouldn't kill us to overcorrect.

139
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,210
而你的男友打了他
And the fact that - your boyfriend assaulted him

140
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,240
讓我沒了任何籌碼
took away any leverage I had.

141
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,790
我盡力了
I did what I could.

142
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,770
我把他調到了
I got him to take a position

143
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:27,610
很少能接觸到其他職員和病患的職位
where he has very little contact with staff, with patients --

144
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:28,760
外聯職位
outreach chair.

145
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,410
還是個很糟糕的調配
And it's a lousy assignment.

146
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,090
他遲早會辭職的
Sooner or later, he's gonna quit.

147
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,360
然后去其他地方工作
And get a job somewhere else.

148
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,750
如果你有更好的主意
If you have any better ideas...

149
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:40,650
我洗耳恭聽
I look forward to hearing them.

150
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,390
你們很幸運
You're very lucky.

151
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:58,220
動脈瘤長在了一條小的交通動脈上
The aneurysm was in a small communicating artery.

152
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:01,200
我們成功修復了受阻大腦區域的供血
We were able to restore blood flow to the impacted brain areas.

153
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,210
他不會有事的
He's gonna be okay.

154
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,200
謝天謝地
Thank God.

155
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:11,330
之后會一直都這樣嗎
Is this what life is gonna be like from now on?

156
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:14,250
他會時不時病發嗎
A-are these things just going to keep happening?

157
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:17,600
他會留院觀察幾天  做些后續檢查
We're gonna keep him here for a few days, do some follow-up testing,

158
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,120
調整一下用藥
make some adjustments to his medications.

159
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,880
但愿能找到發病原因
Hopefully, we'll find out why this happened.

160
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:26,550
我得走了
I have to go.

161
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:30,540
又一個
Another one?

162
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:33,240
術后影像顯示基底動脈上
Post-operative imaging showed a 26-millimeter aneurysm

163
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,740
有個26毫米的動脈瘤
in the basilar artery.

164
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,440
看這大小和位置  很有可能會破裂
That size and location, we're looking at a high risk of rupture.

165
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,270
他肯定有遺傳傾向性
He must have a genetic predisposition --

166
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,230
或許是結締組織病
maybe a connective tissue disease?

167
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:42,960
在修復之前一切都是空談
All academic till we repair it.

168
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:48,140
通過咽部過去了  開始探險吧
Through the pharynx and over - to Grandmother's house we go.

169
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:51,020
這是會厭和聲帶
There's the epiglottis and the vocal cords.

170
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:54,200
我知道你不滿意我起訴了醫院
I know you're not happy that I sued the hospital.

171
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,340
但我不會為此道歉的
But I'm not gonna apologize for that.

172
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,900
這就好辦了
That makes it simple.

173
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:00,290
我這么做  是因為我想留在這
I did it because I want to be here.

174
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,280
我相信能從你那學到很多東西  盡管受你冷落
I believe I can learn a lot from you, even from your doghouse.

175
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:05,930
我只是希望你能給我一個機會
I just hope you give me a chance, sir.

176
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,860
這里是氣管隆凸
There's the carina.

177
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,350
接下來要進入左主支氣管
Gonna pass into the mainstem bronchus of the left lung.

178
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:14,730
和你未婚妻分手算得上創傷性事件嗎
Is breaking up with your fiancée traumatic?

179
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,230
我看見那女人中槍的時候
When I saw a woman get shot,

180
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,960
所有人都說這是精神創傷
everyone told me it was traumatic

181
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,750
說我應該回家休息
and that I should be going home.

182
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,410
你不應該回家休息嗎
Should you be going home?

183
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:29,700
給我一個黏膜刷取細胞樣本
Give me a mucosal brush for a cellular sample.

184
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,520
這就插入黏膜刷
Loading it now.

185
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,480
從與愛人分手的痛苦中走出來
How long does it take to get over a breakup

186
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,810
需要多長時間
with the woman you love?

187
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:37,480
我看到了大面積炎癥
I'm seeing a lot of inflammation,

188
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,940
但是沒有油煙損傷
but no smoke damage.

189
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,850
這說得通
That makes se-sense.

190
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,760
我以為做這項檢查是因為她吸入了油煙
I thought we were doing this because she inhaled smoke.

191
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,870
她說她吸入了油煙
She said she inhaled smoke.

192
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,590
我不相信她
I didn't believe her.

193
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:49,230
不管原因如何  炎癥和損傷是真實存在的
Whatever the cause, the inflammation and the damage are real.

194
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,890
咱們做個粘膜活檢
Let's get a mucosal biopsy.

195
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,140
我要移動到這里  我們
I move down here, we --

196
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:55,630
氣管鏡穿破了她的支氣管壁
The scope breached her bronchial wall.

197
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:56,640
她大出血了
She's hemorrhaging.

198
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,930
-太糟糕了  -準備手術
- This is bad. - Prep the O.R.!

199
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:01,570
交叉配血兩個單位  我們快走
Type and cross two units of blood. We've gotta move!

200
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:05,760
燒傷是明確的
We know there was a burn.

201
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:08,100
氣管損害是不是跟油火有關
Was it something related to the grease fire,

202
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:10,030
或者兩者只是獨立的巧合
or separate coincidental injury?

203
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:18,280
你是沒有想法  還是不想和杰瑞德說話
You don't have a theory, or are you refusing to talk to Jared?

204
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,660
我不回答  是因為我覺得
I didn't answer because it doesn't matter

205
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,020
在我們修復穿孔
until we can repair this puncture

206
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,790
防止細菌進入并傳播引起感染前  這不重要
before bacteria passes through and spreads an infection.

207
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,830
說得沒錯
That's true.

208
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,080
剪線
Cut this suture.

209
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,370
用鑷子吻合切緣
Let's approximate the edges with forceps.

210
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:30,520
你和杰瑞德還在鬧別扭嗎
Are you and Jared even now?

211
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,620
他犯了個錯誤  你也是
He made a mistake. So did you.

212
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,220
我究竟犯了什么錯誤
Exactly what mistake did I make?

213
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,660
穿孔是你弄的
This breach was your fault.

214
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,900
這算精神創傷嗎
Is that traumatic?

215
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:51,730
我自己吃的早餐
I had breakfast by myself.

216
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,080
你去哪了
Where were you?

217
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:55,540
抱歉  我們今早本來應該一起吃早餐是嗎
I'm sorry. Were we supposed to have breakfast this morning?

218
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,810
我今早有個會診
I had an early consult.

219
00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:00,870
對  我們每周一都一起吃早餐
Yes, we always have breakfast on Mondays.

220
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,920
是嗎  每周一
We do? Every Monday.

221
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,490
每周一
Every Monday.

222
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,220
謝謝
Thank you.

223
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:09,850
我猜我們的冷戰已經告一段落了  是嗎
Well, I guess our streak has been broken then, huh?

224
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,790
如果某人在常規支氣管鏡操作中
If someone punctures the bronchus

225
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,140
穿破了支氣管  這算是錯誤  對嗎
during a routine bronchoscopy, that's a mistake, right?

226
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,810
肯定是錯誤
Well, I can't imagine how it wouldn't be.

227
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:20,400
怎么了  你做了什么  肖恩
Why? What did you do, Shaun?

228
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,280
我想知道我是否要舉報梅倫德斯醫生
I'm wondering if I need to report Dr. Melendez.

229
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,000
梅倫德斯醫生干的
Dr. Melendez did that?

230
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,130
規定寫得很清楚
The protocol is very clear.

231
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:29,890
我得舉報
I need to report it.

232
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:34,480
但是我看見他怎么對杰瑞德的
But I've seen how Jared is being treated.

233
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,840
如果我舉報了梅倫德斯醫生
Will Dr. Melendez treat me badly

234
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,180
他會不會也冷落我
if I report this?

235
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:41,030
顯然  他不應該這樣
He shouldn't, obviously.

236
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,890
但是人性就是這么...
But human nature being what...

237
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,000
人性
Human nature?

238
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,550
肖恩  你知道嗎
Shaun, you know what?

239
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,770
這件事應該由你自己決定
You should make this decision for yourself.

240
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,640
其實  其實...
In fact -- In fact...

241
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:01,280
從現在開始  所有的決定都應該由你自己來做
you should to make - all your decisions yourself from here on in.

242
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:05,320
這是我們說好的  對嗎
That's what we agreed on, right?

243
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,690
你有考慮過血管內栓塞術嗎
Have you considered an endovascular embolization procedure?

244
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:14,540
考慮了
I have.

245
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,670
風險會降低
It's a little less risky,

246
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:16,820
但是我做得不多
but I haven't done as many,

247
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:19,170
所以我不確定怎么做比較好
so I'm not sure which way we're better off.

248
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:20,300
你是不是想讓我查一下名單
You want me to check the roster --

249
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,450
看看有沒有更有經驗的醫生能夠勝任
see if there's somebody available with more experience?

250
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,560
是的  我可以從旁協助
I would like to assist, but yes.

251
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,710
好的  我們來看看
Okay, here we go.

252
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,340
不  他沒法做
No, he's not available.

253
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,970
那就想方設法讓他做
So make him available.

254
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,230
身為人夫和人父
I got a husband and father

255
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,820
他在過去的十二小時里已經出現兩個動脈瘤了
who presented with two aneurysms in the last 12 hours.

256
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:38,290
最好不要
I'd rather not.

257
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:40,650
那位外科醫生最近被...
This particular surgeon was recently...

258
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:42,970
調職了
transferred.

259
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,110
沒門
Not a chance.

260
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:53,500
科利是這項手術的最佳人選
Coyle is the best available surgeon for the job.

261
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,560
科利本應該被解雇  如果他被解雇了
Coyle should've been fired, and if he'd been fired,

262
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,670
他根本不可能來做這手術
he wouldn't be available.

263
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:57,760
如果他不能做
And if he wasn't available,

264
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,520
你將會是這項手術的最佳人選
you would be the best person for the job.

265
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,470
我們應該以患者為重
Our ultimate duty is to the patient.

266
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:06,210
不  不是
No, it's not.

267
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,460
你同意他應該被解雇
You agree he should have been fired.

268
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,210
當然
Of course.

269
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:12,120
就算他是這家醫院里最好的醫生
Even if he was the - best doctor in this hospital,

270
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,620
他也應該被解雇  對嗎
he should have been fired, right?

271
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,190
對
Yes.

272
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,970
所以有些事情
So some things have to matter more

273
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:18,770
比誰的手術技術高超更重要
than who is the most skilled.

274
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:22,130
如果科利擅長于某些領域  就能因此得到原諒
If we forgive Coyle just because he's good at something,

275
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:23,990
他接下來會做些什么
what does he do next?

276
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,030
要么選他  要么選我們
Either he matters or we matter.

277
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,600
你在手術過程中感到煩惱嗎
Were you upset during the procedure?

278
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,350
莫菲告訴你我有「精神創傷」了
Did Murphy tell you that I was "Traumatized"?

279
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,650
你覺得我差點害死了一個人
You think that I might have almost killed a person

280
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:45,930
都是因為你甩了我
because you dumped me?

281
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:48,130
事實上  你把這件事說成「我甩了你」
The fact that you're describing it as "Me dumping you"

282
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:50,040
恰恰說明你為此心煩意亂
suggests that you are upset.

283
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,570
聽著  我沒事  你也沒事
Look, I'm fine. You're fine.

284
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:54,920
沒人為此煩心
Nobody's upset.

285
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,770
很好
Great.

286
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,100
但是你要明白
But you do understand

287
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,150
我必須得問你這些問題
that I have to ask you these questions,

288
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,940
因為我需要你給個說法
that I need a statement from you.

289
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,650
明白
Yes.

290
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:04,890
這就是我的說法
Here's my statement --

291
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,890
「我沒有分心
"I wasn't distracted.

292
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:08,150
我沒有搞砸」
I didn't screw up."

293
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,420
你聽明白了吧
You get all that?

294
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,820
你的支氣管在手術過程中發生了穿孔
Your bronchus was punctured during the procedure,

295
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:22,940
不過穿孔已經修復好了
but it's been repaired.

296
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:25,410
什么  怎么會這樣
How? How could that happen?

297
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,010
為什么說謊
Why did you lie?

298
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,990
你說你吸入了油煙
You said that you inhaled smoke,

299
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,970
但支氣管里根本沒有油煙
but there was no evidence of smoke.

300
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,640
所以向你的醫生撒謊  你能得到什么好處
So, what do you gain by lying to your doctors?

301
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,720
我沒有撒謊
I wasn't lying.

302
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,830
我只是...
I was just...

303
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,960
迷糊了  我想
confused, I guess.

304
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,380
我很痛
I was in a lot of pain,

305
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,570
而且一切發生的太快了
and it was all happening so fast.

306
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,020
我的胃
My stomach!

307
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:46,010
納吉  你有什么感覺
Naja, what are you feeling?

308
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:49,140
真的很痛...我感覺我要...
It's really sore and... I feel like I'm going to--

309
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:51,210
這里需要幫助
Can we get some help over here?!

310
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,520
四毫克昂丹司瓊
Four milligrams of ondansetron.

311
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:57,440
氣道炎癥  腹痛  惡心
Airway inflammation, abdominal pain, nausea.

312
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,070
我們需要做全套血液化驗和腹部超聲
We need a full blood panel and abdominal ultrasound.

313
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:06,120
手術會夾閉動脈瘤
The procedure will seal off the aneurysm,

314
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,980
但很有可能會造成一些腦損傷
but there will almost certainly be some brain damage --

315
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:13,530
從輕微的視覺障礙或語言障礙
anything from mild visual or speech disturbances

316
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:16,600
到嚴重的癱瘓  都有可能
to significant paralysis.

317
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,560
但不做手術  他會死
But without the surgery, he'll die.

318
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,440
不  我不同意做手術
No. I-I won't consent to the operation.

319
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,160
你沒有太多選擇的余地
There really isn't a lot of choice here.

320
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,210
不做手術
Without the operation --

321
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:40,550
在他第一次中風后
After his first stroke, it --

322
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:43,630
他花了很長時間才恢復過來
it took him so long to recover.

323
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:49,540
對他來說  這個過程非常痛苦沮喪
It was frustrating and painful for him.

324
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,600
但是他最終恢復過來了
But he did recover.

325
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:59,610
他很清楚  他不想生活在妥協中
He made it clear he'd never want to live compromised.

326
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,560
抱歉
Excuse me.

327
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,970
謝謝你和我一起吃早餐
Thank you for having breakfast with me.

328
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:19,470
這是我的榮幸
My pleasure.

329
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,340
人們經常撒謊  對嗎
People lie a lot, don't they?

330
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:24,270
不  我是認真的  肖恩
No, I-I meant it, Shaun.

331
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,080
我很開心能和你共度時光
I'm happy to spend time with you.

332
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:28,580
我想到了七個原因
There are seven reasons that I've thought of.

333
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:31,080
也許還有更多
There may even be more.

334
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,780
人們會毫無理由地撒謊嗎
Do people ever lie without a reason?

335
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:35,750
不會
No.

336
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:44,190
第六個原因  我認為你剛剛撒謊了
Reason number six. I think you just lied.

337
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,900
我認為你剛為了逃避某些事而撒謊
I think you just lied to avoid something.

338
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,760
你不喜歡這番對話
You don't like this conversation.

339
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,920
肖恩  我很抱歉
Shaun, n-- Shaun, I'm sorry.

340
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:53,140
我只是有點分心
I'm just -- just a little distracted.

341
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,380
我的那位動脈瘤病人
My aneurysm patient --

342
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,510
我們在給他用高血壓藥
We're treating him with blood-pressure meds

343
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:58,020
避免他動脈破裂
to try and avoid a rupture.

344
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:01,300
你們應該采用血管內栓塞
You should do - an endovascular embolization.

345
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,540
他并不想要
He doesn't want one.

346
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,960
會給他的大腦造成損害
It could leave him with brain damage.

347
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,110
我以為他沒有意識
I thought he was unconscious.

348
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,180
是的
He is.

349
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,180
他的妻子知道他想要什么
His wife knows what he wants.

350
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,850
太令人驚訝了
It's amazing. I just --

351
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,480
我不認為我能做到像她那樣
I don't think I'd be able to do that.

352
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:18,300
她犧牲了自己的幸福和未來
She's sacrificing her happiness, her future,

353
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,330
就因為她知道
just because she knows --

354
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:20,460
她在撒謊
She's lying.

355
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:21,810
她在撒謊
She's lying.

356
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:25,590
可能是由于原因四或者是
It could be either reason number four or --

357
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:27,250
不  她沒有在撒謊  肖恩  她愛他
No, she's not lying, Shaun. She loves him.

358
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,270
她不愛他
She doesn't love him.

359
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,830
你都沒有見過她
You haven't even met her!

360
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,110
你沒見過她和他還有他們兒子一起的樣子
You haven't seen what she's like with him, with their son.

361
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,650
我不善于洞悉他人
I'm not good at reading people.

362
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:36,230
-我善于  -我認為洞悉他人
- Well, I am, and - I think people-reading

363
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,760
總會包含自己的偏見
embraces personal biases.

364
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,660
我認為我們應該避免偏見
I think we should try to avoid biases.

365
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,270
了解他人的表現
Knowledge of human behavior

366
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,760
可以讓我們做出有見地的  直覺的決定
can help us make - informed, intuitive decisions.

367
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:50,400
我的方法更好
My way is better.

368
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,070
基于行為之上  她是在撒謊
It's based on actions. She's lying.

369
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,020
好吧
All right.

370
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:57,300
如果你愛一個人
If you love someone,

371
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,160
你會不遺余力阻止他死去
you'll do anything to prevent their death.

372
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:09,970
這個情況
This...situation --

373
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:12,120
可能會產生利益沖突
There seems to be a conflict of interest.

374
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,550
所以我想派一個法律上的第三方
So I would like to bring in someone else from legal

375
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,590
來處理它
to handle it.

376
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,500
我同意
Yeah, I agree.

377
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,570
你是位杰出的律師  但是
You're an excellent lawyer, but --

378
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:23,710
但是什么
But what?

379
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,910
你認為這是我的問題嗎
Do you think this is my problem?

380
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:27,320
這合乎情理
It's understandable.

381
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:28,940
48小時前我們才訂婚
48 hours ago, we were engaged.

382
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,330
現在突然
And now, suddenly,

383
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:31,640
你就要來調查我
you're supposed to be investigating me?

384
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:32,470
是的
Yes.

385
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,550
還有更瘋狂的事
And doing crazy things,

386
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,700
比如期待你會給合適的問題
like expecting you to give me complete answers

387
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,080
一個完整的答案
to appropriate questions.

388
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,570
你相信墨菲的判斷而不相信我的
You were trusting Murphy's judgment over mine.

389
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:43,030
他做出的關于本人舉止的判斷
His judgment about my demeanor.

390
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,240
真的嗎
Seriously?

391
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,330
我就問了你一個問題
I asked you a question.

392
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:47,970
你想要我完蛋
You wanted me to screw up.

393
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:49,440
你確實弄砸了
You did screw up.

394
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,430
所以又怎樣
So what?

395
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:52,670
我們只要處理它就好了
So we just deal with it.

396
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:56,430
但如果你不承認你無法一直完美
But if you can't even admit that you're not always perfect,

397
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:57,990
我不完美
then I -- - I am not perfect!

398
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,790
很明顯  我的人生里也犯過錯
Clearly, I have made mistakes in my life.

399
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,270
但這次不是我的錯
But not this time.

400
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:09,000
刺破支氣管不是我的錯
That punctured bronchus was not my fault.

401
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,620
護士說他的生命體征穩定
The nurse says his vital signs are stable.

402
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,420
沒有變化
No change.

403
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:33,350
很好
That's good.

404
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:38,620
這是
It's...

405
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:42,060
很大的犧牲
such a great sacrifice

406
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:45,190
尊敬他的愿望到甘愿讓他離開
to respect his wishes enough to let him go.

407
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:49,420
你肯定很愛你的丈夫
You must love your husband very much.

408
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,640
但是
But...

409
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:06,090
也可能會有其他的解釋
there could be another explanation.

410
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:10,520
你可能是愛他到愿意讓他死去
Either you love him enough to let him die...

411
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:14,300
又或者是恨他到想讓他死去
or you hate him enough to let him die.

412
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,730
你根本不知道你在說什么
You don't know - what you're talking about.

413
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:24,470
這里有一個醫生曾經騷擾過我
There's a doctor here who harassed me.

414
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:27,640
他讓我覺得自己很脆弱并且毫無價值
He made me feel vulnerable, worthless --

415
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,750
其實我并不是這樣
neither of which I am.

416
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,620
但他沒有傷害過我
But he never hurt me.

417
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:40,320
我無法想象如果他傷害了我
I can't imagine how I would feel if he did,

418
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:42,610
我會做什么
what I would do,

419
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,940
我會想對他做什么
what I would want to do to him.

420
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,220
你的丈夫對你做了什么
What did your husband do to you?

421
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:55,910
他是個好父親
He's a good father.

422
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,730
不  他不是
No, he's not.

423
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:02,100
好父親不會傷害母親
A good father doesn't hurt a mother.

424
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:03,530
佩頓很愛他
Payton loves him.

425
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,570
所有的原因
All the more reason --

426
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:05,290
不
No.

427
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,060
佩頓什么也不知道  他永遠不能知道
Payton doesn't know anything. He never can.

428
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,960
我知道你害怕他會來找你
I know you're afraid he'll come after you,

429
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,630
但有人能夠幫助你
but there are people who can help.

430
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:18,740
{\an8}家庭暴力

431
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:29,640
擁有一個慈父的記憶對佩頓來說
Payton is better off with the memory of a loving father

432
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,810
比知道真相更好
than the truth.

433
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,310
讓他死吧
Let him die.

434
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:51,360
甲醇造成她腹部疼痛
Methanol is causing her abdominal pain.

435
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,820
她是喝了木酒精嗎
She drank wood alcohol?

436
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,320
人們能喝什么就喝什么
People drink whatever they can drink.

437
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:57,230
她是穆斯林  不愿意讓我碰她
Well, she's Muslim -- Wouldn't let me touch her.

438
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:59,350
有宗教信仰的人并不對偽善免疫
Religious people aren't immune to hypocrisy.

439
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,740
甲醇的存在也可能有其他原因
There are other ways to explain the presence of methanol.

440
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,590
肝臟也會產生甲醇
It's also produced by the liver

441
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:08,230
當身體接觸到腐蝕性化學物質
when the body is exposed to certain caustic chemicals.

442
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:11,540
如果被吸入  腐蝕性物質也會刺激肺部
If inhaled, caustic chemicals could also inflame the lungs.

443
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,310
腐蝕性物質還會燃燒
And caustic chemicals also burn,

444
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:15,220
這就解釋了她所有癥狀
so it would explain all her symptoms.

445
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,130
你有沒有能造成所有這些后果的
Do you happen to have a list

446
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:17,680
腐蝕性物質的清單
of which caustic chemicals do all that?

447
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,010
硫酸二甲酯
Dimethyl sulfate

448
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,680
被用于藥業
It's used in - the pharmaceutical industry.

449
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,360
她是學校教師
She's a school teacher.

450
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,730
它也用于水處理  農藥工業
It's also used in water treatment, industrial pesticides,

451
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:28,100
以及化學武器
and chemical weapons.

452
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:29,580
她沒有理由參與到
She has no reason to be involved

453
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,740
水處理或農藥工業中
with water treatment or industrial pesticides.

454
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:35,330
但她可以同時是教師和恐怖分子
But she could be a school teacher and a terrorist.

455
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,230
-所以我們該怎么辦  -做手術
- So, what do we do? - The surgery.

456
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,370
我們沒有得到她的同意
We don't have her consent.

457
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,920
嚴格意義上  我們是沒有得到他的同意
Technically, the issue is we don't have his consent.

458
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,210
我們找他的妻子是因為得不到他的同意
We go to his wife because we can't get his,

459
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:54,180
猜想是她在為了他的利益最大化考慮
the assumption being that she's operating in his best interests.

460
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:55,980
但我不會讓這發生
Pretty sure that's not happening here.

461
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,890
去找他的妻子  改變她的主意
Go back to the wife, get her to change her mind,

462
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,270
不然我們就上法庭
or we'll take it to court.

463
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,530
好的
Okay.

464
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,020
你看上去很煩惱
Hey, you look annoyed.

465
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:07,420
我擔心我們把他送回家他會繼續家暴她
I'm annoyed we're sending him home to keep abusing his wife.

466
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:09,570
她是個一流的騙子
She's a world-class liar.

467
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,360
就我們所知  她希望她的丈夫死掉
I mean, for all we know, she wants her husband dead

468
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,680
她就可以和她的普拉提教練私奔
so that she can run off with her Pilates instructor.

469
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:16,630
-我會讓她同意的  -謝謝
- I'll get the consent. - Thank you.

470
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,550
她拒絕甲醇中毒的初步治療
She refused initial treatment for methanol toxicity.

471
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:25,730
是乙醇
It's ethanol --

472
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:27,370
因為她是穆斯林  她不能使用乙醇
Because she's Muslim, she can't consume it.

473
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,110
她體內本就有酒精
She has alcohol in her system

474
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:31,170
她卻不愿意將酒精輸送到體內進行治療
but won't let us put alcohol in her system to treat it,

475
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:33,140
因為她不想自己體內有酒精
because she doesn't want alcohol in her system.

476
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,380
-我們對她注射了甲  -墨菲醫生
- We put her on fomepi - Dr. Murphy...

477
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:37,710
你憑此就認為她是恐怖分子
Is this part of your evidence that she's a terrorist?

478
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,130
因為她是穆斯林嗎
Because she's Muslim?

479
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:41,330
有成千上萬的穆斯林不是恐怖分子
There are billions of Muslims that aren't terrorists.

480
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:44,130
所以你認為她就不是恐怖分子嗎
Is that part of your evidence that she's not?

481
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:46,640
我認為她是恐怖分子  因為這是最佳的解釋
I think she's a terrorist because it's the easiest way

482
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,950
對于她的癥狀和謊言
to explain her symptoms and her lie.

483
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,350
你有辦法解釋嗎
Do you have a way?

484
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:52,930
她出了事故  嚇壞了她
She had an accident. It scared her.

485
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:56,380
也許是我們嚇壞了她  也許這個地方嚇壞了她
Maybe we scare her. Hell, maybe this whole place scares her.

486
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:58,270
除了犯罪活動之外
There are a lot of reasons people don't tell the truth

487
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,540
還有很多理由會導致人們不說實話
other than criminal activity.

488
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,150
別的六個理由
Six other reasons.

489
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,990
如果一個人入院的時候身上有槍傷
If a person comes in with a gunshot wound,

490
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,470
我們得上報
we have to report it.

491
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:06,790
為什么有人可能在研制化學武器
Why don't we have to report

492
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,630
我們卻不必上報呢
someone who might be making chemical weapons?

493
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,290
因為毫無根據的指控是會毀掉別人的
Because unfounded accusations can destroy people's lives.

494
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:14,840
只要真相水落石出
What does it matter what people speculate

495
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,400
那人們推測什么又有什么關系呢
as long as the truth comes out?

496
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,780
因為人們在真相水落石出之前
Because people make up their minds

497
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:19,340
就已經做出了決斷
before the truth comes out.

498
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:20,870
這話是從一個老打種族牌
Says the guy who played the race card

499
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:22,530
占便宜的人口中說出的
when he needed an advantage.

500
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,040
即使你說的是對的
Even if you're right,

501
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,870
當她在重癥監護室的時候也并沒有制造炸彈
she's not making bombs while she's in our ICU.

502
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:29,470
還有你是錯的  現在  有什么消息通知我
Also, you're wrong. Now, keep me posted.

503
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:31,350
如果她在接下來的兩個小時沒有好轉
If she's not better in the next two hours,

504
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,580
告訴我
I want to know.

505
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,490
我們需要你同意我們給你丈夫手術
We need you to consent to your husband's surgery.

506
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:51,270
我說過了  「不」
I said "No."

507
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:56,270
還有一種更好的辦法  泰莎
There's a better way, Tessa.

508
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,790
離開他
Leave him.

509
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:01,870
開始新的生活
Start a new life.

510
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:09,530
我害怕
I'm afraid.

511
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:10,510
我懂
I know.

512
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:13,060
但是這...
But...this --

513
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:15,530
這不是回答
This isn't the answer.

514
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:18,840
如果你不同意
If you don't consent,

515
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,260
我們會把這個送到法院
we'll take this to the court,

516
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,950
把我們知道的都告訴法官
and we'll tell a judge what we know.

517
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:25,720
我是偷偷告訴你這些的
I told you those things in confidence.

518
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,000
你不是我的病人  你丈夫是
You are not my patient. Your husband is.

519
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,680
有兩種可能
Two things will happen.

520
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,650
我們得到許可
We will get the consent,

521
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:36,680
佩頓會知道真相
and Payton will find out the truth.

522
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,490
泰莎
Tessa?

523
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:17,970
你比你想的要更堅強
You are stronger than you think you are.

524
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,220
你體內甲醇的毒性在減輕...
Your methanol toxicity is abating --

525
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,810
治療有效果了
The treatment's working.

526
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,410
很好
Great.

527
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:48,630
你覺得我用不了多久就可以離開了嗎
Do you think that I'll be able to leave soon?

528
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,100
你的所有癥狀都符合
All of your symptoms are consistent

529
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,490
接觸硫酸二甲脂的癥狀
with exposure to dimethyl sulfate.

530
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:56,270
我  我從來都沒聽過什么硫酸二...
I -- I've never heard of dimethyl --

531
00:24:56,270 --> 00:25:00,250
硫酸二甲脂被用來做化學武器
Dimethyl sulfate is used to make chemical weapons.

532
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:10,170
我沒想到這話是從你嘴里說出來的
I didn't expect this from you.

533
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:13,120
我表達了我的意見
I made a statement.

534
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,190
你不一樣
You're different.

535
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:18,000
我有自閉癥
I have autism.

536
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,640
你體會過人們對你有偏見的滋味
You've experienced bigotry.

537
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,530
是的
Yes.

538
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,290
你有被人拒絕服務過嗎
Have...people refused to serve you?

539
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,890
你有看到過人們
Have you seen people

540
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,630
因為你
change their flight

541
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,370
更改航班嗎
because of you?

542
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:38,670
你有經歷過人們在你開口之前
Have people cursed you out

543
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,720
就對你惡語相向嗎
before you've opened your mouth?

544
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,910
我沒有偏見
I'm not prejudiced.

545
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:47,570
我有證據
I have evidence.

546
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,200
沒有人有偏見
Nobody's prejudiced.

547
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,850
大家都有證據
Everybody has evidence.

548
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:56,170
而我一直都是棕色人種
And I'm always brown.

549
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:00,440
也許你沒那么不同
Maybe you're not so different.

550
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,540
你在出汗
You're sweating.

551
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:10,490
出汗是說謊的一個跡象
Perspiration is a sign of dishonesty.

552
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:14,700
我的胸
My chest.

553
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,900
胸痛可能是由焦慮引起
Chest pain can be brought on by anxiety.

554
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:21,850
但這次  你是心臟病發作了
Oh, but this time, you are having a heart attack.

555
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,320
心電圖  立刻
EKG, stat!

556
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:30,060
血管內皮膜緩和了急性炎癥
The endothelial lining had moderate inflammation that appeared acute,

557
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:32,250
有粘膜水腫的跡象
and there was evidence of mucosal edema.

558
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:34,430
我沒有做任何特別的處理
I made no extraordinary motions,

559
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,700
也沒有采取任何不必要的措施
nor did I apply any unnecessary force.

560
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,950
然而支氣管被刺穿了
And yet, the bronchus was punctured.

561
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,870
這是這種手術的風險
Which is a risk, albeit a small one,

562
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,300
盡管可能性不大
with this kind of procedure.

563
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:45,670
好吧...
Well...

564
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:46,840
謝謝
thank you.

565
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,400
感謝你耐心回答我的問題
I appreciate the thoroughness of your answers.

566
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,840
雖然我也不確定我都明白了...
Not sure I understood it all...

567
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,160
但是我想我已經得到我需要的了
...but I think I've got what I need.

568
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,770
我可能不該說什么
I probably shouldn't say anything,

569
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,620
但我知道你和普萊斯頓女士
but I know you and Ms. Preston

570
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,900
現在正經歷一些事
are going through something right now.

571
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:02,990
那和這一點關系都沒有
That really wasn't relevant.

572
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:05,540
我  我知道  我知道  只是...
I-I know. I know. It's just...

573
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:09,060
我知道她會挺過去的  但...
I know she'll get through it, but...

574
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:12,050
你處理得更好是件好事
it's good you're handling it better.

575
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:16,570
在起草合同的時候被分心是一回事
It's one thing to be distracted while drafting a contract

576
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:20,050
你所做的又是另外一回事了
and a whole other thing entirely doing what you do.

577
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,510
注入染色劑
Inject dye.

578
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:35,520
注入染色劑
Injecting dye.

579
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:40,860
掛在左脊椎動脈上
Hanging a left at the vertebral artery.

580
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:46,140
好了  撤回導線
Okay, withdrawing the guide wire.

581
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:49,860
插入白金色基體
Inserting the platinum matrix.

582
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:56,310
你知道嗎  有的時候  你做了正確的事
You know, sometimes, you do the right thing

583
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,610
事情會變得更好
and things get a little better.

584
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,780
有的時候  事情依舊糟糕
And sometimes, things still suck.

585
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,670
進入動脈瘤
Entering the aneurysm.

586
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:10,320
好了
Okay.

587
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,120
血壓上升
Blood pressure's spiking.

588
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:13,820
等等  為什么
Wait, why?

589
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,590
沒有破裂  沒有出血
There's no rupture, no bleeding,

590
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:16,750
沒有中風
no stroke.

591
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:19,260
如果血壓再高點  他就要中風了
If his BP goes up any higher, he will have a stroke.

592
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:22,010
我現在要停止手術了
I'm terminating the procedure.

593
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,550
立刻推20毫克拉貝洛爾
Push 20 milligrams of labetalol, stat.

594
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:34,950
在再次手術之前我們得讓他穩定下來
We need to stabilize him before we can retry the procedure,

595
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:37,510
也就是說我們得弄清楚我們漏掉了什么
which means we need to figure out what we missed.

596
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:39,090
這不是我們的錯
This wasn't our fault.

597
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,170
他進手術室的時候血壓是穩定的
His BP was stable going in.

598
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,400
過去的六年里他一直服用鈣離子阻斷劑
He's been on calcium-channel blockers for the last six years.

599
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,700
我們漏掉了什么
Well, we missed something.

600
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,830
血壓不會無緣無故就猛漲的
BP doesn't skyrocket for no reason.

601
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,840
做個全面檢查
Run a full work-up.

602
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:55,000
為什么一個28歲的沒有任何風險因素的人
Why would a 28-year-old with no risk factors

603
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:56,320
會有心臟病
have a heart attack?

604
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,560
她的心臟在燃燒
Her heart is burning.

605
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:01,810
燃燒
Burning?

606
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:03,780
因為腐蝕性化學物質
From the caustic chemical!

607
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,250
-莫菲  -穿過了她整個系統
- Murphy. - It's going through her system.

608
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:09,270
不像燒燙傷
Unlike thermal burns,

609
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:11,460
化學灼傷隨著時間會越來越嚴重
chemical burns get worse over time.

610
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:14,510
這也解釋了她的支氣管為什么會穿孔
And it also explains the punctured bronchus.

611
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,750
腐蝕性化學物質使支氣管壁變薄
The caustic chemical thinned the bronchial walls.

612
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,680
你沒有犯錯
You did not make a mistake.

613
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,480
那不是唯一的解釋
That's not the only explanation.

614
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,180
但我現在就閉嘴
But I'll shut up now.

615
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,450
你覺得你有個好主意
You think you have a good idea,

616
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:26,260
但是你準備不說出來
but you're going to shut yourself up?

617
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,530
有可能是由
It could be caused by an infection

618
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:31,060
支氣管穿孔導致的
from bacteria that leaked

619
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,020
細菌感染造成的
as a result of the puncture.

620
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:36,850
如果是感染的話  治療的方式是完全相反的
The treatments are diametrically opposed --

621
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:39,290
如果是感染的話應該輸注抗生素
antibiotics if it's infection,

622
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:41,460
如果是發炎的話應該輸注類固醇
steroids if it's inflammation.

623
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:44,490
如果她需要抗生素  而不是類固醇
If she needs antibiotics and she needs steroids instead,

624
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,860
會抑制她的免疫系統
it will suppress her immune system,

625
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:48,100
加重感染  使她喪命
causing the infection to flourish and kill her.

626
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,680
如果她需要類固醇
If she needs steroids

627
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,420
而我們給她輸注抗生素  那么...
and we give her antibiotics, then --

628
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:52,390
我明白
I get it.

629
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:54,060
我們最好是對的
We'd better be right.

630
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,090
是的
Yes.

631
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,940
先生  我們應該再找一位高級主治醫生參與
Sir, I think we should bring another senior attending in

632
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:00,070
-商量這個決定  -為什么
- to consult on this decision. - Why?

633
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:02,290
因為如果肖恩是對的  你就沒做錯
Because if Shaun's right, you're exonerated.

634
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:03,870
如果我是對的  你可能犯了一個
And if I'm right, you may have made the mistake

635
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:05,040
可能會殺了這位女士的錯誤
that could kill this woman.

636
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,260
你覺得我不能保持客觀
You don't think I can be objective?

637
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:10,260
我認為你非常專業...
I think you're incredibly professional --

638
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:11,510
閉嘴  杰瑞德
Shut up, Jared.

639
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:18,840
有可能是我搞砸了
It is possible that I screwed up.

640
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,560
給她輸注廣譜抗生素
Let's put her on broad-spectrum antibiotics.

641
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,200
你錯了
You're wrong.

642
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:30,420
在你犯錯的前提下做決定是個錯誤
Making a decision on the assumption you made a mistake is a mistake.

643
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:32,630
你很自大
You're very arrogant.

644
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:36,570
這幫你成為更好的外科醫生
It helps you be a great surgeon.

645
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,740
萬幸的是  我用不著你來批準
Fortunately, I don't need your approval.

646
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:54,150
我們確定了潛在的問題
We've determined what the underlying problem was.

647
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:55,960
是什么導致了你丈夫的動脈瘤破裂
What caused your husband's aneurysm to rupture

648
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,430
以及他在手術室血壓下降的緣由
and why his blood pressure spiked in the O.R.

649
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,420
數據顯示  他沒有在服用藥物
According to his labs, he hasn't been taking his meds.

650
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:03,240
據我所知  他有吃藥
As far as I know, he has.

651
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,820
這不像他
I mean, that's just not like him.

652
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:07,830
我們也覺得不是他
We don't think it's like him, either.

653
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:13,400
你們覺得是我做了手腳
You think I had something to do with this?

654
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:16,850
怎么  我扔了他的藥嗎
That I, what, threw his meds away?

655
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,010
他會再訂一些
He'd just order more.

656
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:23,610
但如果你清空了他的膠囊  并換成糖
But if you emptied his capsules and filled them with sugar --

657
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:25,530
或者更好  換成鹽
or, even better, salt --

658
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:27,990
這會結束你的噩夢
It would end your nightmare.

659
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:33,320
我很愿意讓他死
I was willing to let him die,

660
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,420
但我怎么可能...
but I could never --

661
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,670
如果我足夠勇敢去殺他...
If I were strong enough to kill him...

662
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:57,960
有沒有可能  你兒子知道得比你以為的多
Is there a chance your son knows more than you think he does?

663
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,830
她的心率是90
Her heart rate's 90.

664
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,940
這在正常范圍內
That's in the normal range.

665
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:25,450
但之前是83  應該降低才對
But it was 83. It should be going down.

666
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:28,080
她其它體征都正常
All her other signs are normal.

667
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,180
你是對的  這是妥善處理
You were right. This is the proper treatment.

668
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,450
95了
95.

669
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:37,450
我要換成類固醇
I'm switching her to steroids.

670
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:39,710
如果給她注射類固醇
If we give her steroids,

671
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:42,050
那會抑制她的免疫系統
it will suppress her immune system,

672
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:43,300
導致嚴重感染
causing the infection to flourish...

673
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,250
我要注射40毫克甲基強的松龍
I'm going to push 40 milligrams of methylprednisolone.

674
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:46,770
進而死亡
...and she'll die.

675
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:49,160
我來承擔
This is on me.

676
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:51,070
我知道
I know.

677
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,260
我們給她換成了甲基強的松龍
We switched her to methylprednisolone.

678
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:04,600
起作用了
It's working.

679
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:06,290
你錯了
You were wrong.

680
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:07,770
是的  我知道了
Yeah, I got that.

681
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,770
只是治療方案錯了
Just about the treatment choice.

682
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:10,880
你在手術室里沒做錯
You didn't do anything wrong in the O.R.

683
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,130
別拍我馬屁了
Don't kiss my ass.

684
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:15,550
杰瑞德救了她
Jared saved her life.

685
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:19,510
如果他沒有迅速采取措施  她可能就死了
If he hadn't acted so quickly, she would've died,

686
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:22,080
而那是你的錯
and that would've been your fault.

687
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:23,330
是的  沒錯
Yes, it would've.

688
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,790
你應該感謝他
You should thank him.

689
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:34,320
謝謝你  卡盧醫生
Thank you, Dr. Kalu.

690
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:30,930
有什么事嗎
Can I help you?

691
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:33,840
我是肖恩·莫菲醫生
I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.

692
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:37,210
你是我的新鄰居  34號
You're my new neighbor, number 34.

693
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:39,860
好吧
Yeah, cool.

694
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:42,560
你想進來喝瓶酒嗎
You wanna come in for a beer?

695
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,470
不了
No.

696
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,510
干得不錯
Nice work.

697
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:54,530
你也是
You, too.

698
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,680
功勞屬于你
You can have the honors.

699
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:00,960
這是第一次  我不想告訴家人
This is the first time I'm not looking forward

700
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,200
手術進行得很順利
to telling the family it went well.

701
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:31,530
你會沒事的
You're going to be fine.

702
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:33,630
治療見效了
The treatment worked?

703
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:37,380
第二次的見效了  第一次的差點害死你
The second one did. The first one almost killed you.

704
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:39,540
你現在還活著
The fact that you're alive right now is evidence

705
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,390
就證明你接觸了硫酸二甲酯
that you were working with dimethyl sulfate.

706
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:43,940
你是恐怖分子  是不是
You're a terrorist, aren't you?

707
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:49,000
我哥哥在藥廠工作
My brother works for a drug company.

708
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:52,860
他們用硫酸二甲酯來制藥
They use dimethyl sulfate to make one of their medications.

709
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:53,960
他替我偷了一些
He stole some for me.

710
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:56,410
讓你來做化學武器
So you could make a chemical weapon.

711
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:58,590
讓我做香水
So I could make perfume.

712
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:04,180
你聞
Smell that.

713
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:18,860
很好聞
It's...beautiful.

714
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,220
但很蠢
But very stupid.

715
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,180
是啊
Yeah.

716
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:26,520
尤其當我哥哥隨時可能被炒魷魚
Especially since my brother would get fired

717
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,920
如果有人發現這事
if anyone ever found out.

718
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:30,950
你相信她
You believe her?

719
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,860
保護某人
Protecting someone --

720
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:34,830
第三種理由
reason number three.

721
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,320
我們還好嗎
So...we good?

722
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:42,210
問題是  我不確定這是否重要
Thing is, I'm not sure it really matters.

723
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:44,380
我被告知  我明年只能有三位住院醫師
I've been told I can only have three residents next year.

724
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,730
這太好了
That's great.

725
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:46,730
算不上
Not really.

726
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:49,220
因為科利走了  我得接手他的
Because of Coyle's transfer, I have to take on his.

727
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:51,370
雷茲尼克
Reznick?

728
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,810
她可讓人頭痛
She's a pain.

729
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,380
頭痛也可以轉化為動力
Pain can be a hell of motivator.

730
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:57,950
祝你好運
Good luck.

731
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,450
你是對的
You were right.

732
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:10,710
你是對的  而我希望你錯了
And I think you were right that I wanted you to be wrong.

733
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,520
我很抱歉
And I'm sorry.

734
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,430
你也沒錯
You were right, too.

735
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:21,110
我一直告訴自己  我沒事  但...
I kept telling myself that I'm fine, but...

736
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,360
這很艱難
it's been hard.

737
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:26,010
讓我懷疑自己
Got me second-guessing myself,

738
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,810
也許影響了我的判斷
maybe affecting my judgment.

739
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:29,140
我說不好
I don't know.

740
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:33,610
如果我們這么難過  也許我們做錯了
If we're hurting so bad, maybe we made a mistake.

741
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,570
不
No.

742
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,960
這只是說明我們的曾經很重要
It just means that what we had mattered.

743
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,830
不代表那是對的
Doesn't mean that it was right.

744
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:45,410
我也在想...
I've also been thinking that...

745
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:48,590
自大讓我成為了更好的外科醫生
arrogance does make me a better surgeon.

746
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,780
但不會讓我成為更好的丈夫
But it's not gonna make me a better husband.

747
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:57,060
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

748
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:10,890
克麗絲汀嗎
Kristin?

749
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,230
我是克萊爾
I'm Claire.

750
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:16,000
謝謝你
Thanks.

751
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,540
我在調查科利醫生
I am doing some research on Dr. Coyle --

752
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:29,440
調查和他共事但辭職的女人
on the women who worked with him and then quit.

753
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,720
我接到了市區交通的工作邀請
I got another offer at SF Muni.

754
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,480
我被科利醫生騷擾了
I was harassed by Dr. Coyle.

755
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:42,550
我覺得你也是
And I think you were, too.

756
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,300
做正確的事  能讓事情變得更好
Doing the right thing can make things a little better...

757
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,890
尤其當我們一起做的時候
especially if we do it together.

758
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:26,860
我有新鄰居了
I have a new neighbor.

759
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:31,610
這么說莉亞真的走了
So, Lea's really gone, huh?

760
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:35,240
我們明天能一起吃早餐嗎
So, can we have breakfast tomorrow?

761
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:39,340
我很想去  肖恩  但是...
I'd love to, Shaun, but...

762
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:44,200
我們...
we...

763
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,920
我們談過了
We talked about this, right?

764
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:51,410
我說了如果你留下  我不會繼續緊逼
I-I said that I would back off if you stayed, right?

765
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:52,410
給你更多空間  不再試圖當你的父親
More space, less "Fathering."

766
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:53,940
我不需要父親
I don't need a father.

767
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,650
我討厭父親
I hate fathers.

768
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:56,510
是的  所以...
Right, so --

769
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:58,450
我需要朋友
I need a friend.

770
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:08,630
肖恩  我忍不住會給他人建議  你明白嗎
Shaun, I-I am someone who can't help but give advice, you know?

771
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:12,170
我不知道自己能否做到
I don't know if I can not do that.

772
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:18,880
所以你覺得我能改變  但你不能
So you think I can change and you can't?

773
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:23,850
我覺得我們的關系很特殊
I think that we have a certain kind of relationship.

774
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,510
如果我們愿意  可以將之稱其為其它的
And we can call it something different if we want,

775
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:29,490
但我們無法改變它
but we can't magically make it different.

776
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:31,410
你說了你想要空間
You said that you wanted space.

777
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:33,190
你說你需要空間
You said that you needed space.

778
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:43,520
我覺得你應該當我的朋友
I-I think you should be my friend.

779
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,500
肖恩
Shaun...

780
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:07,280
好的
Okay.

781
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:12,220
肖恩
Shaun?

782
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:22,220
