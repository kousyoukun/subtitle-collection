00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:02,520
「良医」前情回顾
Previously on "The Good Doctor"...

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,150
科利医生  他有点太过友好了
Dr. Coyle -- He's a little too friendly.

3
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:06,570
我想他只是想和你融洽相处而已
I'm sure he's just trying to establish a rapport.

4
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:07,840
我按摩手法很棒
I give great massages.

5
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:09,610
早上我会给你做一个好吃到死的煎蛋卷
And I'll make a killer omelet in the morning.

6
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,310
这真是太不合适了
That's really inappropriate.

7
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,280
我说了不
I said no.

8
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,740
但你在违抗命令
You're approaching insubordination.

9
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,450
你得跟人事部提出投诉
You have to file a complaint with HR.

10
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,060
他们会把错怪在我身上  就像你一样
They will shift the blame onto me. Like you did.

11
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:21,690
我因为殴打同事被解雇了
I've just been fired for physically assaulting an employee.

12
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:23,750
你为什么要我辞职去组建家庭
So, why do I need to quit my job to have a family?

13
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,000
同意  她可以既是优秀的律师又是优秀的母亲
Agreed. She can be a great lawyer and a great mom.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,460
我不想要孩子
I don't want to have kids.

15
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,260
我不需要治疗师
I don't need a therapist.

16
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,010
我想自己做决定
I want to make my own decisions.

17
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:32,380
我不想再说了
I am done talking.

18
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:33,510
-走  -不  不
- Now let's go. - ?No. N-No.

19
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:34,550
我不需要帮忙
I don't want help!

20
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:35,300
他去哪了
Where would he go?

21
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,760
有他想去的地方吗
Is there a place he likes to hang out?

22
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,060
他不在医院
I mean, he's not at the hospital.

23
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:39,770
以前这里有一张照片
And there used to be a picture here.

24
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:41,340
意思是他不会回来了
It means he's not coming back.

25
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,020
早上好
Hi. Good morning.

26
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,110
我是亚伦·格拉斯曼  格拉斯曼医生
I'm Aaron Glassman. Dr. Glassman.

27
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:49,480
是肖恩的同事
I work with Shaun.

28
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:51,320
很高兴见到你
Hi. Nice to meet you.

29
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,680
也很高兴见到你  我能跟他谈谈吗
It's nice to meet you, too. May I speak with him, please?

30
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,680
肖恩不在这
Shaun isn't here.

31
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,770
我知道你在帮肖恩  我很感激
I know you've been helping Shaun, and I appreciate that,

32
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,690
但我需要立刻跟他谈谈
but I really need to speak with him immediately.

33
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:07,070
我见到他后一定转告他
I'll definitely let him know when I see him next.

34
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:09,320
抱歉
I'm -- I'm sorry.

35
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:10,340
你在干什么
What the hell are you doing?

36
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,630
肖恩  我知道你在这
Shaun, I know you're in here.

37
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:14,030
我想跟你聊聊  拜托了
I just -- I just want to talk, please.

38
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,550
你太过分了
You are way out of line.

39
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:17,790
肖恩  你有责任在身
Shaun, you have responsibilities.

40
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:19,260
咱们得解决了
We've got to sort this out.

41
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:20,890
给你五秒钟滚出去
You have five seconds to get the hell out of here...

42
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:22,480
-肖恩  -不然我就报警了
- Shaun. - or I'm calling the police.

43
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,790
-肖恩  我... -搞什么
- Shaun, I just -- - What are --

44
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:25,130
我只想...
I just want to...

45
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:28,800
-五  -肖恩
- Five... - Shaun.

46
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,900
肖恩  她要报警了
Shaun, she's calling the police.

47
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,400
-四  -你想这样吗
- four... - Is that what you want?

48
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,260
三
three...

49
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,140
-二  -好  好
- two... - Okay, okay.

50
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,350
-一  -好好  我走
- one. - Okay, okay, I'm leaving.

51
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:41,500
只是肖恩习惯逃避冲突
It's just that Shaun has a-a tendency to run away from conflict.

52
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,750
而在卡斯珀和医学院
And in Casper and medical school,

53
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:46,120
人们会敷衍了事  但是...
people will give you a little bit of slack, but it --

54
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:47,880
他现在有份很难得的工作
now he's in a very hard-to-get job

55
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,700
竞争非常激烈
in a very competitive environment

56
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,030
那里的人不会给你第二次机会
where people do not give you a second chance.

57
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:55,700
还是不行
Still, not cool.

58
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:04,670
如果你联系到他了  请打给我
If you speak with him will you call me, please?

59
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:05,920
出去
Out.

60
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:09,300
好
Yeah.

61
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:14,700

他就像个「狗拿耗子」的老混球
I gotta say, he seems like a nebby, old jerk.

81
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:46,210
后 期     斯人

82
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,100
还很霸道
And a bully.

83
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,770
「狗拿耗子」什么意思
What's "Nebby"?

84
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:47,230
多管闲事  匹兹堡的说法
Nosey. It's a Pittsburgh thing.

总 监     夕橙

86
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:48,810
你都是个成年人了
I mean, you're a grown man.

87
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,550
如果你不想跟他说话  那就不关他的事
If you don't want to talk to him, it's none of his business.

88
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:55,220
圣何塞太大了
San Jose is too big.

89
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,740
我不喜欢圣何塞
I get not liking San Jose.

90
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,200
我自己不太喜欢  但是
I'm not the biggest fan myself, but --

91
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,280
我不想去看治疗师
I don't want to see a therapist.

92
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:03,270
那就不看
So don't.

93
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,730
我该回卡斯珀
I should go back to Casper.

94
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:09,820
我有个原则
I have a rule.

95
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,300
生气  沮丧  嗑嗨了或做爱前后
Never make an important decision while you are angry,

96
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:17,450
绝对别做重要的决定
upset, high, or right before or after having sex.

97
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,930
好了  你工作太累了  压力太大
Okay, you are overworked, stressed out,

98
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,180
还在生你老板的气
and pissed off at your boss.

99
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,080
现在不适合做重大决定
Now is not the time to be making a big decision.

100
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:27,380
你得缓口气  让头脑清醒
You need to take a break, clear your head.

101
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,600
你需要休假
You need a vacation.

102
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,940
我还得工作五个月才能休假
I have to work five more months before I earn a vacation.

103
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,130
那就请病假
So call in sick.

104
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,050
我没生病
I'm not sick.

105
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:38,780
你真可爱
You're so adorable.

106
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:41,950
请病假不是要你非得生病
You don't have to be sick to call in sick.

107
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:44,370
你有好多要学  愣头青
Ah, I have so much to teach you, Grasshopper.

108
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:47,450
先从一场舒适老套的旅行开始吧
And I'm gonna start with a good, old-fashioned road trip.

109
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,290
这是重新振作的最佳办法
It's the perfect way to get your mojo back.

110
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:50,250
等我们回来了
And when we return,

111
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,030
你就会知道该如何处理
you're gonna know exactly what to do about

112
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:55,320
圣何塞  治疗和唠叨鬼小格
San Jose, therapy, and Glassy the Grouch.

113
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,380
要获得
And all you have to do

114
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:59,050
这种高超的智慧和知识
to attain this superior wisdom and knowledge

115
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:05,000
你只需请病假
is to call...in...sick.

116
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,130
好  好  我会的
Okay. Okay. I will.

117
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,090
梅伦德斯医生  给你个病例
Dr. Melendez. Got a case for you.

118
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,690
我今天安排很紧
My schedule's pretty packed today.

119
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:23,100
是我的病患  需要做肾脏移植
It's a patient of mine. She needs a kidney transplant.

120
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:24,350
找到捐赠者了吗
You have a donor?

121
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,810
她的同卵双胞胎姐妹  DNA完全匹配
Her identical twin -- a perfect DNA match.

122
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,200
那为什么是你的病患
Why is she a patient of yours?

123
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,370
我在她们的头皮下放了球状组织扩张器
I put balloon tissue expanders under both girls' scalps

124
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:33,120
准备给她们做分离手术
to prepare them for the separation surgery.

125
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:34,570
分离手术
Separation surgery?

126
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:42,410
等她们六个月后移植康复了再做
It's in six months, after they recover from the transplant.

127
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:44,180
当然了  你要是太忙了
Of course, if you're too busy...

128
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,700
不  我来
No. I'm in.

129
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:51,940
-莫菲在哪  -他还没来
- Where's Murphy? - He's not here yet.

130
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,130
真会挑日子迟到  已经人手不足了
Wrong day to be late. We're already shorthanded.

131
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,270
-其实我想跟你说说这事  -我没有开除卡卢
- Actually, I wanted to talk to you about that. - I did not fire Kalu.

132
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,300
如果你对此不满  去找安德鲁斯
And if you have a problem with it, talk to Andrews.

133
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,600
但你要是想听我的建议  别心怀不满
Although, if you want my advice, don't have a problem with it.

134
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:07,030
安德鲁斯在等着新病患的简报
Andrews is waiting to brief us on a new case.

135
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:10,690
给一对连头双胞胎做肾脏移植
It's a kidney transplant on craniopagus twins.

136
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,210
连体的
Conjoined?

137
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:13,540
颅骨相连
They're connected at the skull.

138
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:16,280
她们共用整个肾血管系统
Their entire renal-vascular systems are interdependent.

139
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,820
酷
Cool.

140
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:20,530
你们有谁联系过肖恩吗
Have either of you talked to Shaun?

141
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,990
-没  -没  很正常
- No. - No, which isn't unusual.

142
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,740
出什么事了吗
Is anything wrong?

143
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:28,220
不  肖恩没事  是家庭急事
No, no, not with Shaun. It's a family emergency.

144
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,810
他要请几天假
He's gonna be out for a few days.

145
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:31,060
私事请假需要得到
He's supposed to get approval

146
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,980
他的主治医生的批准
for any personal days from his attending.

147
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,390
对  所以我才来问问
Right, which is why I'm checking in.

148
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,050
我觉得他以为光通知到我就够了
I think he thought it was enough just to notify me.

149
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:43,500
尼尔·梅伦德斯医生

150
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:50,980
请病假了吗
You call in sick?

151
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:55,190
我收拾好了
I'm ready to go.

152
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,360
不  还没有
No, you're not.

153
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,930
只带一张家人的照片和一把牙刷是不够的
You're gonna need more than a family photo and a toothbrush.

154
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:07,760
去收拾吧
Go pack.

155
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,050
我们要去哪里
Uh, where are we going?

156
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,390
车到哪里我们就去哪里
Wherever the car takes us.

157
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,510
我不喜欢沙滩
I don't like the beach.

158
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,290
好  我会告诉车的
Okay, I will let the car know.

159
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,350
即便你们的心血管有问题
Even with your cardiovascular issues,

160
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:20,110
肾脏移植的风险也比较低
a kidney transplant is a relatively safe procedure,

161
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,940
更何况你们是同卵双胞胎
especially since, with identical twins,

162
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,610
不会出现器官排斥
there's no chance for organ rejection.

163
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:26,030
只是你得确保分得清谁是谁
Just make sure you keep straight which one's which.

164
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:29,820
漂亮迷人的那位肾脏是好的
The charming, pretty one has the good kidneys.

165
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:32,410
别担心  我们一直都会再三确认
Don't worry. We always triple confirm.

166
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:34,910
而且一切都会做好标记
And we put everything in writing.

167
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:36,860
而且你俩都很漂亮迷人
And you're both charming and pretty.

168
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,460
开玩笑啦  妈妈
It was a joke, Mom.

169
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,050
捐赠者

170
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,830
还很聪明
And smart.

171
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,590
她们秋天就要去常青藤大学念书了
They're gonna be Ivy Leaguers in the fall.

172
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:43,070
耶鲁和哈佛
Yale and Harvard.

173
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,840
妈  你不必见个人就跟人说
Mom, you don't have to tell everyone you meet

174
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,180
-我们考上了哪所大学  -当然要了
- where we're going to college. - Yes, I do.

175
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,640
太棒了  恭喜
That's awesome. Congratulations.

176
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,120
接受者

177
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,350
谁念哪所大学
So, who's going where?

178
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:55,560
你觉得呢  她简直太讨厌了
What do you think? She's totally obnoxious

179
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,390
以为自己比实际有趣多了
and thinks she's way funnier than she is.

180
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,590
肯定是哈佛
Definitely Harvard.

181
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:02,880
别让我嘲笑你的文身
Hey, don't make me start mocking your tattoo.

182
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,570
还以为你的公寓
I thought you would have your entire apartment

183
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:10,680
会把你拖住呢
strapped to your back.

184
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:13,690
-我收拾了很久  -很好
- It takes me a long time to pack. - ?That's good.

185
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,350
我就要找你这种死扣细节的人
An anal-retentive packer is the exact type of person

186
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:17,710
给我做手术
I'd want operating on me.

187
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:20,080
莉亚  你的车在这
Lea, this -- this is your car.

188
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,610
对对  但我们开另一辆
Yeah, yeah, yeah. We're gonna take my other one.

189
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:25,360
好  你是做什么的
Okay. What do you do at work?

190
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:28,510
你是真想知道我的工作  还是想知道
Do you really care what I do, or do you just want to know

191
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:31,890
住那种破公寓的人怎么买得起两辆车
how someone with such a crappy apartment can afford two cars?

192
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:36,000
我只想知道你怎么买得起两辆车
I just want to know how you can afford two cars.

193
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,540
对  我买不起
Yeah, I can't.

194
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:41,440
我的祖父罗德去年去世了
Uh, my Grandpa Rod died last year,

195
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,970
他把最值钱的东西留给了我
and he left me his most prized possession.

196
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,600
「条纹番茄」车
It's the S-Striped Tomato.

197
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:52,490
天啊  你喜欢《警界双雄》
Oh, my God. You like "Starsky & Hutch"?

198
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:53,770
还好啦
It's okay.

199
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:57,330
打包一丝不苟  还是《警界双雄》的粉丝
A meticulous packer and a "Starsky & Hutch" fan.

200
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:59,150
祖父罗德会爱死你的
Grandpa Rod would have loved you.

201
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:06,700
BGM: The Heat by The Bones of J.R. Jones

202
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,220
好  准备好了  上路
Okay. This is it. The road.

203
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,740
你确定要这么做吗
You sure you want to do this?

204
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,450
现在发话  不然就永远闭嘴
Speak now or forever hold your peace.

205
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,170
我确定
I'm sure.

206
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,630
走吧  莉亚
Let's go, Lea.

207
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,880
出发了
Here we go!

208
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,450
听说莫菲擅离职守了
I hear Murphy's AWOL.

209
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:40,070
他请了几天私人事假
He's taking a few personal days.

210
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:41,840
未经批准的私人事假
Unapproved personal days.

211
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,790
我批准了
I approved them.

212
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,450
不该由你批准
It's not your job to approve them.

213
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,310
或者说你批准是为了掩饰
Or to say you approved them to cover up the fact

214
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:50,500
莫菲最近已从迟到演变成旷工了
that Murphy's frequent tardiness has escalated to absences.

215
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,550
你想怎么样  给我做测谎吗
What do you want me to do, take a polygraph?

216
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,110
不如直接跳到升级审讯吧
How about we jump into enhanced interrogation?

217
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,970
这样吧  要我把这个打开吗
Here, how about this? Do you want me to turn this on?

218
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,070
董事会当时重新考虑你聘用莫菲
When the board was reconsidering your hiring of Murphy,

219
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:06,350
你答应过  如果他表现得并不是非常出色
you assured us that if he was anything less than excellent,

220
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,620
他会被辞退  而且你也会辞职
he'd be dismissed and you would resign.

221
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,000
我相信你还记得
I trust you remember that.

222
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,320
我还不打算把办公室让给你
I wouldn't have your movers pack up your office just yet.

223
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,080
你不能永远都护着莫菲
You can't protect Murphy forever.

224
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:19,740
有些时候  他需要自己经历成败
At some point, he needs to succeed or fail on his own.

225
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:26,930
好的  肾移植热缺血灌注时间
Okay, that's three hours on the warm ischemia clock

226
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:28,830
三小时
of the transplanted kidney.

227
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,540
输尿管与膀胱相连
The ureter is attached to the bladder.

228
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:34,380
肾脏在髂窝的位置如何
How's the kidney's placement in the iliac fossa?

229
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:39,480
肾脏血管无结节或扭曲
No kinking or twisting of the renal vessel.

230
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:39,930
很好
Good.

231
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:44,260
准备好关腹了吗
You ready to close?

232
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:46,430
准备好了
Yes.

233
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,250
你最好沿筋膜层进行连续缝合
Your best bet is a continuous suture along the fascial layer.

234
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,020
准备缝合
Suture.

235
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,170
供者血压下降
Donor's pressure's dropping.

236
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:00,420
好了  提高氧含量
Okay, up the oxygen.

237
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,090
珍妮肯定有内出血
Jenny must be bleeding internally.

238
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:03,420
我们得给她重新开腹
We're gonna have to open her back up.

239
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,580
起钉器
Staple remover.

240
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,250
我喜欢树
I like trees.

241
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,560
是吗  你还喜欢什么
Yeah? What else do you like?

242
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,050
除了看医学期刊和重播的老掉牙警匪剧
Besides reading medical journals and watching reruns of old cop shows?

243
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,300
我喜欢你
I like you.

244
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:26,060
谁不喜欢我  我这么招人喜欢
Well, who wouldn't? I'm very likeable.

245
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:28,910
为什么你不喜欢圣何塞
Why don't you like San Jose?

246
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,730
这里的人们都太好胜了
Everyone's so competitive here.

247
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,910
如果你没有在三十岁前挣够一百万
You know, if you didn't make a million by 30,

248
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:35,040
你就是个十足的失败者
you're a total loser.

249
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,940
我不需要一百万
I don't need $1 million.

250
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,820
我甚至觉得我连九万块都不需要  但是...
I don't even think I need $90,000, but...

251
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:42,800
我们得来点音乐
You know what we both need are some tunes.

252
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,090
你在车上喜欢听什么音乐
What's your preferred driving music?

253
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:46,170
音乐  不  不
M-Music -- No. N--

254
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,260
我不喜欢音乐  不  不
I don't like music. No. No.

255
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:50,330
什么  不行  不行
What? No, no. Not okay.

256
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,140
好吧  你说不喜欢海滩  我接受
Okay, I will give you a pass on not liking the beach

257
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,020
因为你很可爱
because you're cute

258
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,440
而且说不定哪天我需要你给我的脑袋做手术
and I might need you to do brain surgery on me someday,

259
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,840
但是不喜欢音乐  不可理喻
but not liking music -- unacceptable.

260
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:00,770
我不接受
I won't have it.

261
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:02,400
你是在讽刺吗
Are you being sarcastic?

262
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,090
不  我是在...
No. I'm being...

263
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:08,030
我不知道用什么词来形容  但我坚持我的观点
I actually don't know the word for it, but my point stands.

264
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,010
音乐是个好东西
Music is amazing.

265
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:12,030
发生在我身上的
You know, I remember every important thing

266
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,370
每一件重要的事情
that has ever happened to me

267
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:17,020
我都是根据当时在听什么音乐记住的
based on what song I was listening to at the time.

268
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:19,110
我记得味道
I remember smells.

269
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:23,460
比如我们的车库闻起来像柔软剂
Like our parking garage smells like fabric softener,

270
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:26,030
我弟弟死的那天  闻起来就像烧焦的食物
and when my brother died, it smelled like burnt food.

271
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:30,040
天呐  我很抱歉  我没想到
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. I had no idea.

272
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,210
他是怎么...你介意我问他的事吗
How did he, um... if you don't mind me asking?

273
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,090
我爸爸很讨厌
My father was mean.

274
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,060
他弄死了我的宠物
He killed my pet,

275
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:44,690
所以我弟弟和我  我们离家出走了
so my brother and I, we ran away.

276
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:46,610
我们在玩的时候他从火车上摔下去
Then he fell off a train we were playing on,

277
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:47,930
撞到了头  死了
hit his head, and died.

278
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:53,230
我再也没回过家
I never went back home.

279
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,650
从那以后一直是格拉斯曼医生在照顾我
Dr. Glassman has watched out for me ever since.

280
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:04,740
好吧  这么说  他或许也不算是烦人的家伙
Okay, so, maybe he's not that much of a nebby jerk.

281
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,620
你现在闻到什么了
What are you smelling right now?

282
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,700
松树
Pine trees.

283
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,680
我永远都不会忘记
I'm never gonna forget

284
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,390
当你在向我讲述你弟弟和你爸爸的时候
that when you told me about your brother and your dad,

285
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:22,840
有松树的味道
it smelled like pine trees.

286
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,820
但我也不想让你忘记
But I don't want you to ever forget

287
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:28,590
就在你跟我讲完以后  我们在听...
that right after you told me, we were listening to...

288
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,760
不  忘了这首
Ouch. No. Do not remember that.

289
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,200
也忘了这首
Or that.

290
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,480
不了  谢谢
No, thank you.

291
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,520
不  没感觉
Nope. Not feeling it.

292
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:41,470
? ...the satellites in the fuse box, too ?

293
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:41,520
太好听了
Ooh, so good.

294
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:45,070
? Our sharp teeth are the only light ?

295
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:44,630
你永远也不会忘记这首歌
This is the one you will not forget.

296
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:45,820
别忘了这首歌
Do not forget this.

297
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,830
? I drank the whole moon dry ? ?Moon dry ?

298
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:51,670
BGM: 14 Faces by Lewis Del Mar

299
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:49,460
? Cause all my friends are metalheads ?

300
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,120
? Swear they'd never catch us dead ?

301
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:54,590
? Split up when the police come ?

302
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:58,760
? Yeah, running used to get me high, high ?

303
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:03,280
? Now I only feel tired ?

304
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:08,840
珍妮发生了术后肾静脉破裂
Jenny had a post-op renal-vein rupture.

305
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:11,030
我们在她失血过多前修补好了
We were able to repair it before she lost too much blood.

306
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,740
两个孩子现在生命体征稳定
Both your vitals are stable now,

307
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,850
而且凯蒂的新肾脏功能良好
and Katie's new kidney is functioning well.

308
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:15,950
谢天谢地
Thank God.

309
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:19,480
她破裂的静脉会对我们的分离手术有什么影响吗
Will her ruptured vein have any effect on our separation surgery?

310
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,750
最好不要
It better not.

311
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,410
凯蒂  我爱你
Katie, I love you,

312
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:23,000
但是我再也不想
but if I have to spend one minute more than

313
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,080
看你练莫扎特的歌了
I have to watching you practicing some Mozart song --

314
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:28,360
那不是歌  那是协奏曲
They're not songs. They're concertos.

315
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:32,240
别担心  手术六个月后按计划进行
Don't worry. Six months is still the plan.

316
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,840
我的所作所为极其不专业
Look, what I did was incredibly unprofessional

317
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,140
而且...不可原谅
and just...inexcusable.

318
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,890
但我想你还是要来求得原谅的
But I'm guessing you're gonna give one anyway.

319
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:55,760
不
No.

320
00:13:56,570 --> 00:14:00,520
不  只是解释  以及...请求
No, just an explanation and a, uh...request.

321
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,870
这样我就可以说服安德鲁斯
It could help me to convince Andrews

322
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,440
给我第二次机会
I deserve a second chance.

323
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,940
好吧  说来听听
Okay. Let's hear the explanation.

324
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,450
布朗医生和我...在交往
Dr. Browne and I are... seeing each other.

325
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:15,950
你可以站在我的角度想想
Look, if you could just put yourself in my shoes.

326
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:18,540
我在乎的女人告诉我有人在骚扰她
A woman I care about tells me a guy harassed her,

327
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:20,640
更糟糕的是  她说这是我的错
and, even worse, she tells me it's my fault

328
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,680
因为我太愚蠢迟钝
because I was too -- too stupidly insensitive

329
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,460
不知道她经历了什么
to understand what she was going through.

330
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,170
我觉得我自己就是垃圾
I felt like crap.

331
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,190
而且  我就像白痴一样
And like an idiot,

332
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:32,970
我...试图去补偿她
I...tried to make it up to her.

333
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:39,310
我只是想要一点理解
All I'm asking for is just a little understanding.

334
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:42,390
你可以理解我吗
Wouldn't you have done the same thing?

335
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,400
不是我的问题
Not my problem.

336
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,460
怎么了
Yeah?

337
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:56,300
珍妮心动过缓  还有低血压
Jenny's bradycardic and hypotensive.

338
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,220
-发生了什么  -她之前还好好的
- What's happening? -She was fine a minute ago.

339
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,660
我们在聊天  然后她突然就开始呼吸困难
We were talking, then she started to have trouble breathing.

340
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:06,290
珍妮心力衰竭了
Jenny's heart is failing.

341
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:08,630
没有脉搏
No pulse.

342
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:10,920
她有室速  把手推车推过来  呼叫梅伦德斯
She's in V-tach. Grab the cart, page Melendez.

343
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,020
珍妮情况稳定了
Jenny's stable.

344
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:24,730
我给她用了β受体阻滞剂和血管扩张剂
I have her on beta blockers and vasodilators,

345
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:25,750
但这还不够
but it's not gonna be enough.

346
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,000
一定是肾静脉破裂使她
Renal-vein rupture must have caused

347
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,050
本就十分脆弱的心脏情况恶化
her already weak heart to deteriorate.

348
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:30,260
她现在处于终末期心衰
She's in end-stage failure.

349
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,510
我会在移植登记中心加上她的名字
I'll get her on the transplant registry.

350
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:33,370
她还能撑多久  几个月  几周
What are we talking? Months? Weeks?

351
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:34,410
只有几天
Days.

352
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,080
我们没法在几天之内找到一颗心脏
We're not gonna find a donor heart in a few days.

353
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,350
我们可以把她们俩的身体分开
We could disconnect her from the other body

354
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:46,130
这样她的心脏就不用为对方的血液进行氧合了
her heart is partially oxygenating the blood for.

355
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:50,070
肾移植手术六个月后进行分离手术
I was already pushing the envelope to do the separation surgery

356
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:52,110
已经是在挑战极限了
six months after a kidney transplant.

357
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:52,820
你真的觉得
Do you really think

358
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,600
她们能在肾移植术一天后就经受分离手术
they could handle it one day after?

359
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:57,890
这或许是我们唯一的选择了
It may be our only choice.

360
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:01,650
是的
Yeah.

361
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,610
新语音留言  来自亚伦·格拉斯曼医生

362
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:08,170
他的电话比这场雨还扫兴
His calls are an even bigger buzzkill than this rain

363
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:10,280
彻底破坏了这趟旅行的目的
and defeating the whole purpose of this trip.

364
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:11,320
好吧
Okay.

365
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:15,790
住院医师不应该关掉手机
Residents are not supposed to turn off their phones.

366
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:19,050
我们做个交易怎么样
How about we make a deal?

367
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:22,770
如果你关掉手机  我就让你开车
If you turn off your phone, I'll let you drive.

368
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:25,670
-我没有驾照  -我知道
- I don't have a driver's license. - I know.

369
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:29,190
-我一直想学开车  -我知道
- I've always wanted to learn to drive. - I know.

370
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:31,730
格拉斯曼医生  他一直都不想让我开车
Dr. Glassman -- he never wanted me to.

371
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,340
我知道
I know.

372
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:33,530
其实我不知道
Actually, I didn't know that,

373
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:35,640
但是说不知道听起来太傻了
but that definitely sounds like Glassy.

374
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,350
好吧
Okay.

375
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:40,230
不错吧
Yeah?

376
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:49,070
你开的很好
You're doing awesome.

377
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:50,820
天生就会开车
You're a natural.

378
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,280
谢谢
Thank you.

379
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:54,410
我也是这么想的
I think so, too.

380
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:57,620
左转灯
Blinker.

381
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,250
好了  这里左转
All right, now make this left turn.

382
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:04,080
好了  这次别绕圈了
Okay, don't circle this time.

383
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:06,670
直接前进吧
Just keep going straight.

384
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,190
为什么停下来
?What are you stopping for?

385
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:14,680
你想让我开到路上
You want me to go out on the street?

386
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:18,140
车本来就该在路上开
It's where the car wants to go.

387
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:20,570
走吧
Come on.

388
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,440
最坏的可能是什么
What's the worst thing that could happen?

389
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:27,020
我可能会撞死人
I could run over someone and kill them.

390
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,570
你是有自闭症  可你不瞎
You have autism. You're not blind.

391
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:32,200
而且有我在这陪着你
And I'll be right here with you.

392
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,350
半圆顶  我们来了
Half Dome, here we come.

393
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,310
我能听收音机吗
Can I turn on the radio?

394
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:45,580
-不行  不行  谢谢  -好吧  好吧
- No! No, thank you. - Okay, okay.

395
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,140
很好
Nice.

396
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,040
我们认为提前进行分离手术
We believe moving up the separation surgery

397
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,040
可以减轻珍妮心脏的负担
will lighten the load on Jenny's heart,

398
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,580
或许可以让她的心脏稍微恢复
maybe allow it to recover a bit

399
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,830
这样未来就不需要做移植手术了
so a transplant won't even be necessary in the future.

400
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,900
现在凯蒂将面临更高的风险
It is higher risk for Katie now,

401
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,570
考虑到她的新肾脏还没有完全发挥功能
given that her new kidney is still not fully functional.

402
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,990
你觉得我们应该怎么办
What do you think we should do?

403
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:21,340
这是你的身体  你来决定
It's your bodies. Your decision.

404
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:23,600
-妈妈  别这么说  -不  我是认真的
- Mom, stop it. - No, I'm serious.

405
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,830
我希望你们俩坚强独立  你们做到了
I raised you both to be strong and independent, and you are.

406
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,840
所以不论你们的决定是什么  我都支持
So whatever you decide, I'll support.

407
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:35,590
咱们做手术吧
Let's do it.

408
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:38,590
做吧  把我们分开
Go ahead. Chop us in half.

409
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:40,760
凯蒂
Katie?

410
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,950
我们需要你们两人都同意
We obviously need both your consent.

411
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:45,240
-做吧  -你确定
- Okay. - You sure?

412
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,600
你还想再了解一下吗  还有问题吗
You want to talk more? Have any questions?

413
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,110
没有  我没事  做手术吧
No. I'm good. Let's do it.

414
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,200
我想要一辆车
I want a car.

415
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,200
那就买一辆
So get one.

416
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,510
你已经开了半小时了
You've been driving a half-hour,

417
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:01,050
你比圣何塞一半人开得都好
and you're already better than half the people in San Jose.

418
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:03,330
我独自一人的时候会走神
I get distracted when I'm alone.

419
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:06,060
所以我有时候会错过公交车
That's why I miss my bus sometimes.

420
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:09,600
格拉斯曼医生觉得我开车的时候也会走神
Dr. Glassman thinks I'd do the same thing driving.

421
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,290
他大概说得对
He's probably right.

422
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,170
想找点乐子吗
Want to have some fun?

423
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,130
-现在就挺好的  -停车
- I'm already having fun. - Stop the car.

424
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,800
-为什么  -听我的
- Why? - Just do it.

425
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,600
谢谢
Thank you.

426
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:27,060
别担心  现在整条路上只有我们一辆车
Don't worry. We're the only car on the road right now.

427
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,520
把左脚放在刹车上
Put your left foot on the brake.

428
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:31,110
好吧
Okay.

429
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:32,020
好了
There we go.

430
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:35,630
现在全踩下去  好了
Now hold it all the way down. There you go.

431
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:38,950
现在右脚把油门踩到底
Okay, now floor the gas with your right foot.

432
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:43,300
我不确定这样好不好
I-I don't know about this.

433
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,640
没关系的  没事的
No, it's okay. It's okay.

434
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,330
现在把左脚从刹车上慢慢抬起
Now slowly ease your left foot off the brake...

435
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,460
直到听到...
until you hear...

436
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:53,710
这声音
this.

437
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:55,840
我闻到烟味了
I smell smoke.

438
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:58,020
对  就是这样  肖恩
Yeah, that's the point, Shaun.

439
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,130
我们在烧耗轮胎  再来一次
It's burning rubber. Do it again.

440
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:02,850
好
Okay.

441
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:11,100
真有意思
Now, this is fun.

442
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,690
好了  够了
Okay, that's enough.

443
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:16,320
我们得留点轮胎载我们回家呢
We need some rubber left to get us home.

444
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,790
我在烧耗轮胎
I am burning rubber.

445
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,910
-好了  肖恩  该停下了  -好吧
- Okay, Shaun, it's time to stop. ?- Okay.

446
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:24,700
肖恩  把另一只脚从油门上松开
Shaun, take your other foot off the gas!

447
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,870
肖恩  看路
Shaun, look out!

448
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:29,970
另一只脚  另一只脚
It's the other foot! Other foot!

449
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:31,140
是另一只脚  另一只脚
It's the other foot! It's the other foot!

450
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,210
另一只脚
It's the other foot!

451
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,150
我和柯医生花费数月
Dr. Ko and I have been working for months

452
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:39,260
来绘制珍妮和凯蒂的脑部构造图
to map the structure of Jenny and Katie's brain.

453
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,270
你是说两个脑部吧
Don't you mean "Brains"?

454
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,280
实际上  尽管两部分独立为两姐妹运作
Actually, while different regions operate independently for each sister,

455
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,570
但只有一个大脑
there is a single brain mass.

456
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:46,530
所以她们之前的神经外科医生
That's why all their previous neurosurgeons

457
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:48,410
都认为分离术不可能成功
insisted separation was impossible.

458
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:50,450
分离大脑并不是问题
The real problem won't be dividing their brains

459
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,690
分离静脉才是
but dividing their veins.

460
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:56,400
她们共享一根矢状窦静脉
They share a single sagittal sinus vein.

461
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,130
我们会将其分给珍妮
Which we'll give to Jenny.

462
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:01,590
用凯蒂腿上的移植静脉造根新的给她
Then we'll create a new one for Katie using a grafted vein from her leg.

463
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:04,090
很好  你让他们跟上了进度
Nice. You've gotten them up to speed fast.

464
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:06,130
在十二小时内完成六个月的准备工作
Well, with 6 months of prep to do in 12 hours,

465
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:07,290
他们只能这样了
it was their only choice.

466
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,000
那我们开始吧
So, let's get started.

467
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:10,140
-我撞车了  -我们没有
- I crashed. - We didn't.

468
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,720
-有  我撞车了  -我们只是...
- Yes, I- I crashed. - We just...

469
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,020
-我撞到了什么  -肖恩  肖恩
- I hit something. - Shaun. Shaun.

470
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,310
我撞到了什么  真的  我撞到了
I hit something. I did. I hit something.

471
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:16,060
-肖恩  你... -我知道我撞上了
- Shaun, you... - I know I did.

472
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:17,600
-我感觉到了  我撞车了  -肖恩你没撞车
- I felt it. I crashed. - Shaun, you didn't crash.

473
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,350
-撞了  -你只是开离了公路
- Yes. - You just drove off the road...

474
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:19,480
-不是  -而且都是我的错
- No. -And it was totally my fault.

475
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,650
不  你错了  我撞上了
No, you're wrong. Nuh- unh. I hit something.

476
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:22,440
-不  你没有  -我感觉到了
- No, you didn't. - I felt it.

477
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,440
-我撞车了  -不  肖恩  看着我
- I crashed. I crashed. - No, Shaun, look at me.

478
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,400
冷静一下
Calm down. Calm.

479
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,310
-好  -看着我  看着我
- Okay. Okay. - Look at me. Look at me.

480
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:29,070
深呼吸  不管发生了什么
Breathe. Whatever happened,

481
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:31,480
不管你感到了什么  你什么都没做错
whatever you felt, you did nothing wrong.

482
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:34,150
都是我的错  好吗
It was all my fault, okay?

483
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,580
好吧  格拉斯曼医生说得对
Okay. Dr. Glassman... He was right.

484
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:44,200
我不应该开车
I-I should not be allowed to drive.

485
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:45,490
不应该
No, no.

486
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,300
肖恩
Shaun.

487
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,680
不  我不会开车的  谢谢
No, I'm not going to drive, thank you.

488
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,330
我知道  没人要开车
Yeah, I...I know. No one is.

489
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,500
因为你是对的  我们确实撞到了什么
'Cause you were right. We did hit something.

490
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,810
看起来一切正常
Everything is still looking good.

491
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:19,210
如果你晚上有什么需要
If you need anything during the night,

492
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:20,480
按呼叫按钮就会有人过来
just press your call button.

493
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,940
珍妮睡着了吗
Is Jenny asleep?

494
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,610
是的
Yeah.

495
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:25,670
安德鲁斯医生在哪儿
Where's Dr. Andrews?

496
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:29,080
他跟柯医生和梅伦德斯医生在一起
He is with Dr. Ko and Dr. Melendez.

497
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:32,290
他们在协调明天的手术方案
They're working to finalize the surgical protocol for tomorrow.

498
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,620
我得和他谈谈
I need to talk to him.

499
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:36,420
有什么我能做的吗
Is there anything I can do?

500
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,600
我改变主意了
I changed my mind.

501
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,460
我不想做分离手术了
I don't want to do the separation surgery.

502
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:47,720
我马上去找他
I'll go find him right away.

503
00:22:57,450 --> 00:22:59,660
我明白她很害怕  但不做手术
I understand she's scared, but without this surgery,

504
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,660
她们俩都很可能会死
there is a good chance both of them die.

505
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:02,530
你和她们母亲谈过了吗
Have you talked to the mother?

506
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:05,200
她不想搅进来  坚持由她们自己决定
She refuses to weigh in, insists it's their decision.

507
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,700
让我试试和她谈
Let me try and talk to her.

508
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:08,020
我觉得这不是个好主意
I don't think that's a good idea.

509
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:11,150
你发明了你要用来分离她们的技术
You invented the technique you're gonna use to separate them.

510
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,960
-所以呢  -所以她没法客观
- So? - So she's not even close to objective.

511
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,420
现在不是担心诉讼的时候
Okay, now is not the time to be worrying about lawsuits.

512
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,170
这是我的工作
That's my job.

513
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,970
而我们的工作是救这两个女孩的命
And our job is saving these girls' lives.

514
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:22,830
好了  放轻松  我们都是同一阵营的
Okay, take it easy. We're all on the same team here.

515
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,100
-我去和她谈  -你已经和她谈过了
- I'll talk to her. - You've already talked to her.

516
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,330
我再去试试
I will try again.

517
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,510
应该让布朗去
Browne should do it.

518
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:34,630
我
Me?

519
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:37,970
我们需要一个十八岁女孩可以信任的人
We need someone that an 18-year-old girl trusts.

520
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:41,350
她也是我们之中最善于沟通的人
She's also the best communicator out of all of us.

521
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,600
好吧
Okay.

522
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,410
我们给凯蒂一晚上来想清楚
We'll give Katie the night to think it over.

523
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,830
布朗  你早上去和她谈
Browne, you'll talk to her in the morning.

524
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,610
让她同意这项手术
Get her to consent to this surgery.

525
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,280
如果我做不到呢
And if I'm not able to do that?

526
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:02,680
这不是什么大事  车会坏
It's not a big deal. Cars break.

527
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:05,790
所以上帝才发明了机械学  以及酒
That's why God makes mechanics... and booze.

528
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:07,260
两杯龙舌兰  谢谢
Two shots of tequila, please.

529
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:09,430
我不渴
I'm not thirsty.

530
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:11,960
没人因为渴才喝龙舌兰的
You don't drink tequila because you're thirsty.

531
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:15,300
你喝醉过吗
Have you ever been drunk?

532
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,260
从没有吗
Never?

533
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:22,470
八年大学都没参加过兄弟会派对吗
Eight years of college a-and not one frat party?

534
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:25,320
赛前聚会呢  你室友的21岁生日会
Tailgating? Your roommate's 21st birthday?

535
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:26,560
你做什么工作
What is your job?

536
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:28,390
现在你对我的工作感兴趣了
Now you're interested in my job?

537
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:30,100
是的
Yes.

538
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,670
我是汽车工程师
I'm an automotive engineer.

539
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:37,170
我在为一家初创公司设计无人驾驶汽车
I work for a start-up that's developing new designs for self-driving cars.

540
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:38,610
你喜欢吗
Do you like it?

541
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,570
不喜欢
No.

542
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,220
我喜欢建造东西
I like to build things,

543
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:48,160
不喜欢开着没完没了的会来讨论建造东西
not to sit in endless meetings talking about building things.

544
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,120
谢谢你
Thank you.

545
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:51,890
来得正好
Perfect timing.

546
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:54,550
我们应该忘记工作
We are supposed to be forgetting about work.

547
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:01,930
敬快乐地活着  因为离死还有很久
For living happy because you're a long time dead.

548
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,610
很好喝
It's... good.

549
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:20,920
天啊  你一定是史上第一个
Oh, my God. You have to be the first person in history

550
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,910
-真的喜欢第一杯龙舌兰的  -很好喝
- to actually like their first tequila shot. - It's good.

551
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:25,470
-你想再来一杯吗  -好
- Do you want another? - Okay.

552
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:29,080
-好的  -龙舌兰
- Yes. - Tequila. Stat.

553
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,000
好极了
Yes!

554
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,050
怎么了
What?

555
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,260
抱歉  我在发呆
Sorry. I'm just zoned out.

556
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:47,810
我们应该歇一会
We should break this off.

557
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:49,640
也学不了那么多
There's only so much studying you can do.

558
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:58,650
你想要孩子吗
Do you want kids?

559
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:02,450
抱歉  这不关我的事
Sorry. That's none of my business.

560
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:07,340
不  我只是没想到你会问这个
No, it's... it's just not a question I was expecting.

561
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:10,370
杰西卡刚告诉我她永远不想生孩子
Jessica just told me she doesn't. Ever.

562
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,020
这没道理
It doesn't make any sense.

563
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:15,390
她肯定会是个非常棒的母亲
She would be such an amazing mother.

564
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:19,010
她很幸运  意识到得还不算晚
I guess she's lucky she realized before it's too late.

565
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,380
有些女人就来不及了
Some women don't.

566
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:24,930
我母亲绝对是其中之一
My mom was definitely one of those.

567
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:28,100
-抱歉  我不是想... -没关系
- Sorry. I didn't mean to... - No, it's okay.

568
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:31,980
都过去了[桥下的水]  那差点淹死我
Water under the bridge... that nearly drowned me.

569
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,230
很久之前了
It was a long time ago.

570
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,190
我不知道该怎么做
I don't know what to do.

571
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:41,030
我不能想象没有她的生活
I can't imagine my life without her,

572
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:45,620
但我也无法想象没有孩子的生活
but I also can't imagine a life without...

573
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,660
抱歉
I'm sorry.

574
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:52,890
这不关你的事
Again, this is not your problem.

575
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:55,250
-没事  -回去吧  再见
- It's okay. - Go. Goodbye.

576
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,340
找到一个你的生活缺之不可的人
Finding someone you can't imagine a life without,

577
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:07,640
这很难
it's hard.

578
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,270
我知道这很陈词滥调  但确实如此
I know it's a cliché, but it is true.

579
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:16,900
再见
Good night.

580
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:22,940
再见
Good night.

581
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:26,380
BGM: Isands in the Stream by Dolly Parton & Kenny Rogers

582

?岛在湾流中?

583
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,670
?那便是我们?

?如何能弄错?
? How can we be wrong? ?

586
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:32,790
?与我共远航?
? Sail away with me ?

587
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,680
?去另一世界?
? To another world ?

588
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:38,980
?我们相依靠?
? And we rely on each other, ah- ha ?

589
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:42,420
?对彼此专一?
? From one lover to another, ha- ha ?

590
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:47,390
?此生只爱你?
? I can't live without you ?

591
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:02,690
我爱你
I love you.

592
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:04,900
我也爱你
I love you, too.

593
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:10,660
我会去收养中心做志愿者
So, I will volunteer with foster kids,

594
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:12,330
指导小孩子运动
coach youth sports.

595
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:15,050
有其他不需要我成为真正的父亲
There are other ways that I can be a father figure

596
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,750
但我也能当父亲的办法
without actually being a father.

597
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,560
我在一天内  教会你装病翘班
In one day, I taught you how to play hooky from work,

598
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:27,730
开车  喝酒
how to drive, how to drink,

599
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:29,090
唱歌来震撼全场
and how to totally rock the house in karaoke.

600
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:33,860
不  你没教好我怎么开车
No, y-you did not teach me to drive very well at all.

601
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:34,700
没教好
At all.

602
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,490
-你怎么敢这么说  -我撞车了
- How dare you. - I-I-I crashed.

603
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:38,490
不  你没撞车
No, you didn't crash.

604
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:41,290
你撞到了一块不应该待在那的石头
You hit a rock that should not have been there.

605
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:44,860
路肩的意义就是提供缓冲区
The whole point of a road shoulder is to provide a buffer zone.

606
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:49,590
谁会设计一条有大石头的缓冲区啊
Who the hell desi... designs a buffer zone with a huge rock in it, you know?

607
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:51,160
他们应该被开除
They should be fired.

608
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,600
等一下  朋友
O-Okay, hold it right there, partner.

609
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,770
我还有东西要教你
I got one more thing to teach you.

610
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:00,630
什么
What is it?

611
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:03,500
结束约会的正确方法
The proper way to end a date.

612
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:09,510
告诉我你希望我今晚玩得开心
Tell me you hope I had a good time tonight.

613
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:11,720
说啊
Go ahead.

614
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:18,080
我希望你今晚玩得开心
I hope you had a good time tonight.

615
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,250
很开心  我今晚很开心
I did. I had a very nice time tonight.

616
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:23,730
跟你一起唱K超有趣
You're really fun to sing karaoke with.

617
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:27,790
现在告诉我  我也很有趣
Now tell me I'm really fun, too,

618
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:30,240
你希望我们可以尽快再来一次
and that you hope we can do it again soon.

619
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:35,970
你  你也很有趣
Y-Y-You're really fun, too.

620
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:39,040
-谢谢  -希望我们可以尽快再来一次
- Thank you. - I hope that we can do it again soon.

621
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,330
现在帮我打开门
Now open the door for me.

622
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:49,150
如果我直接进门
Now, if I just walk in,

623
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:51,780
别试着再约我第二次了
don't bother trying for a second date.

624
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,740
这只是一次小失败  没什么大不了的
It's a swing and a miss, not a big deal.

625
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:54,740
大家都遇到过
It happens to everyone.

626
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:57,160
但如果我不直接进门
But if I don't walk in,

627
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,740
如果我站在你面前
if I just stand there in front of you

628
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,810
表现得好像不太愿意进去
like I don't really want to go inside,

629
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:06,940
就像我现在这样  你就得吻我
like I'm doing right now, then you have to kiss me.

630
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,070
吻我  肖恩
Kiss me, Shaun.

631
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:33,340
你以前吻过别人吗
Have you ever done that before?

632
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:38,930
没  没  没有
No, no, no, no.

633
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,930
好吧  你还挺擅长的啊
Well, you're pretty good at it.

634
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:42,600
你还想再来一次吗
You want to do it again?

635
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,060
想  可是
Yes, but...

636
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:45,730
可是什么
But what?

637
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,540
我知道这挺可怕的
I know it's frightening.

638
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:04,670
你们已经经历很多了
You've already been through so much.

639
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,440
我不是害怕
I'm not scared.

640
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,800
我只是在想  「如果这一切是命中注定呢」
I just think, "What if this is how we're meant to be?"

641
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,640
也许我们连在一起更好
Maybe we're better as one.

642
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,940
我在一辆拖车上长大
I grew up in a trailer,

643
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:27,240
我妈妈每天都在说
with, uh, my mom telling me every day

644
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:29,670
我跟她一样
that I was no better than her

645
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:32,760
我成不了什么事
and that I would never do anything,

646
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,340
只能一辈子默默无闻
I'd never be anyone,

647
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:35,410
而我
and I...

648
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,960
我讨厌待在那里
I hated being there.

649
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:43,230
但当我终于要离开那里的时候
But when I finally left,

650
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:46,840
离开那个脏兮兮的
walking out of the dirty,

651
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,420
恶心的两厢拖车
disgusting double-wide...

652
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:56,140
那是我做过的最艰难的事
was the hardest thing I've ever done.

653
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,030
等等  所以我在这个故事里
Wait, so, am I the awful mom

654
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,560
扮演的是糟糕的妈妈还是恶心的拖车
or the disgusting trailer in this story?

655
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,530
你们一路走来努力做到这一切真的很棒
It's amazing what you've accomplished so far.

656
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:13,070
真的很棒
It really is.

657
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:19,120
但你们还能收获更多
But you can be so much more,

658
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:21,080
也能获得自由
and with the freedom

659
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:25,920
真正地成为独立的个体
to just finally be yourself.

660
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,710
两个独立的个体
Just yourself.

661
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:41,200
凯蒂同意做手术了
Katie's back on board.

662
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:41,940
我就说吧
Told you.

663
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:44,770
她很有说服力的
She's very persuasive.

664
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,780
肖恩
Shaun?

665
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:09,000
我觉得很恶心
I feel disgusting.

666
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:10,900
你只是宿醉而已
You're just hungover.

667
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:14,680
你再也不会想让我吻你了
You are never gonna want me to kiss you ever again.

668
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:18,510
如果我跑出来前已经刷过牙了
If I had brushed my teeth before I rushed out here,

669
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:20,970
我会让你现在就吻我
I'd ask you to do it again right now.

670
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:24,890
你为什么要对自己这么严苛
Why are you so hard on yourself?

671
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:31,360
你小时候一定常被人嘲弄吧
I'm sure you got made fun of a lot when you were a kid,

672
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,880
那些回忆在你心里留下一道疤  我明白的
and that leaves a mark. I know.

673
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:37,990
但你必须摆脱它  把它埋起来
But you gotta shake it off, rub some dirt on it.

674
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,640
如果你一直生活在恐惧里
You're never gonna be happy

675
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,500
你永远也开心不起来的
if you constantly live in fear.

676
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:56,030
-我们得谈谈  -我跟你没什么好谈的
- We need to talk. - Look, I have nothing to say to you.

677
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:57,430
那你就听着好了
Well, then, you can just listen.

678
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:00,150
你不是受害者  一点都算不上
You are not a victim. Not even close.

679
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,570
但如果你不说服安德鲁斯给杰瑞德复职
But you will be unless you convince Andrews

680
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:03,770
你就走着瞧吧
to reinstate Jared.

681
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:05,330
你是在威胁我吗
Are you threatening me?

682
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:07,850
不  我只是想提醒你
No, I'm just informing you that there is no way

683
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,410
不可能只有我一个住院医生被你胁迫
that I'm the only resident that you tried to intimidate

684
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:11,620
跟你上床
into having sex with you.

685
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:15,030
我会不遗余力地找出她们
And I will make it my mission in life to find every single one

686
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:16,950
让她们去投诉你
and get them to file a complaint against you

687
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:19,070
除非杰瑞德能复职
unless Jared gets his job back.

688
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:20,470
你凭什么这么肯定
And what makes you so sure

689
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:21,970
安德鲁斯会在乎我说的话
Andrews cares what I have to say?

690
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:24,680
我不确定  但无论是能帮到杰瑞德
?I'm not. But either Jared's career gets saved,

691
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,210
还是能让你自食恶果
or yours gets destroyed.

692
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,170
我都乐享其成
Either way is a win for me.

693
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:36,170
给我十五号刀
15 blade.

694
00:34:44,410 --> 00:34:46,890
移除第一个球状组织扩张器
Removing the first balloon tissue expander.

695
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:01,030
移除了一个  还有五个
One down. Five to go.

696
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:16,480
新语音留言  来自亚伦·格拉斯曼医生

697
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:24,430
肖恩  还是我
Hi, Shaun. It's me again.

698
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:30,600
安德鲁斯医生一直不是支持你的那一方
You know, do-- Dr. Andrews has never really been in your corner,

699
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:35,040
你无故旷工引发了不小的问题
and your absence is causing a real problem.

700
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,440
在来得及挽救之前一定要打给我
Please call me before it's too late.

701
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:42,160
至少打给我让我知道你在哪儿
Or at least call me and let me know where you are

702
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,780
我很担心你
'cause I'm worried.

703
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:55,440
我们可以用超声吸引装置的低频声波来分开她们
The cavitron allows us to use a low-frequency sound wave to separate them

704
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,060
过程中也不会损伤到健康的组织
so that we don't damage the healthy tissue in the process.

705
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:02,180
我还是分辨不出从哪里分开凯蒂和珍妮
I still can't tell where Katie starts and Jenny ends.

706
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:06,560
这图有很大帮助
The imaging is a huge help.

707
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:10,200
但是一旦开始给患者做手术
But once the patient is opened,

708
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,310
就会像在越野滑雪一样
it's kind of like backcountry skiing.

709
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,110
虽然表面上看起来大不相同
It's never the same on top.

710
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:17,690
但你真正要去关注的
What you want to focus on

711
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,610
是那些藏在下面的你所熟知的组织结构
is the terrain you know is underneath.

712
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,740
候诊室

713
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:33,300
给妈妈在候诊室听的歌  凯蒂

714
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:40,890
BGM: Get up Get on by Jill Andrews

715
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:42,540
? Here, here we are ?

716
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:49,760
? And all we got, we had from the start ?

717
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,510
? So get up, get up, get up, and go on ?

718
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:56,060
切断
Cut.

719
00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:00,530
? Keep your head up, love ?

720
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:02,850
? Keep your heart strong ?

721
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,070
移植的矢状面已经到位
Grafted sagittal's in place.

722
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:04,990
松开血管钳
Let's remove the clamps.

723
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:10,910
好的
Okay.

724
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:16,700
? Cover up the war inside ?

725
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:15,340
看起来不错  没有出血
Looks good. No leaks.

726
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:18,210
关键的时刻到了  给我剪刀
Now the moment of truth. Scissors.

727
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:23,580
? The most beautiful part of ourselves is the part we hide ?

728
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:22,220
柯医生  你要来吗
Dr. Ko, would you like to do the honors?

729
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,220
当然
Definitely.

730
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:29,670
? So get up, get up, get up, and get on ?

731
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:30,060
给我点地方  好吗
Can we get a little more room?

732
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:32,390
马上
Coming right up.

733
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:37,260
? Just a little belief to shake off the doubt ?

734
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,990
成功把她们分离了
And then there were two.

735
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:49,290
? It's building up ?

736
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:53,690
? It's been building up for so long ?

737
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:00,960
谢谢你带我一起自驾游
Thanks for taking me on a road trip.

738
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,180
我心情好多了
I feel a lot better.

739
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:06,610
我觉得我已经准备好跟格拉斯曼医生谈谈了
I think I'm ready to talk to Dr. Glassman.

740
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:08,260
我心情也好多了
Yeah, I feel much better, too,

741
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:11,620
我也准备好跟我的上司谈谈了
and ready to talk to my boss.

742
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:13,770
你要跟你的上司谈什么
What do you have to talk to your boss about?

743
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:16,190
他想给我升职
He offered me a promotion.

744
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:19,360
你能赚百万年薪了吗
Will you be making $1 million?

745
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:21,030
真好笑
Very funny.

746
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,880
我现在一年赚七万  升职以后可以赚九万
I make $70,000 now, and the new position pays $90,000,

747
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,200
但我不准备接受
but I'm not gonna take it.

748
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:29,840
为什么
Why not?

749
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,550
涨了两万年薪呢
It pays $20,000 more.

750
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:36,640
我会算  肖恩  但这趟旅行下来
Yeah, I get the math, Shaun, but just taking this trip and --

751
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,440
你启发了我  让我鼓起勇气去做那些
and you have inspired me to do something

752
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,270
想做了很长时间
that I've been thinking about for a really long time,

753
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:43,050
但却一直不敢去做的事
but I've just been too scared to do it.

754
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,680
我要辞职
I'm gonna quit my job.

755
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:48,030
你太傻了
You're so silly.

756
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:49,650
那你白天做什么呢
What would you do during the day?

757
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,030
改装旧车
Rebuild old cars.

758
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:54,730
再也不用开电话会议  再也没有开不完的会
No more conference calls. No more never-ending meetings.

759
00:38:55,370 --> 00:38:59,270
我唯一不舍得的是
The only thing I'm not looking forward to is,

760
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:00,650
要搬走
is moving.

761
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,280
你为什么要搬走
Why would you move?

762
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,280
因为我要搬去以后工作的那家店
Because that's where the shop that I'm gonna work at is.

763
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:08,550
我继承了爷爷的「条纹番茄」车
I got the Striped Tomato.

764
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:11,240
我哥哥东尼  继承了罗德爷爷的店
My brother, Donny, got Grandpa Rod's shop

765
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,330
在宾夕法尼亚州  郝尔希镇
in Hershey, Pennsylvania.

766
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:18,810
爷爷过世一年多了  但每次我开他的车时
It's been over a year, but every time I drive his car,

767
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:21,880
我都止不住地想
I... keep thinking,

768
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:25,980
「我不需要多高的职衔
"You know, I don't need a more impressive title

769
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,510
或者年薪百万」
or $1 million."

770
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:30,610
每年夏天他都会带我去阿拉斯加钓鱼
He would take me fishing in Alaska every summer,

771
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:32,320
圣诞假期就去滑雪
skiing every winter break.

772
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,280
过去的四年里我没有休过一天假
I haven't taken more than one day off in four years

773
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,580
因为我总是要工作
because I always work.

774
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:37,990
工作永远也做不完
It never stops.

775
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,940
这次跟你一起出来玩让我意识到
And just taking this trip with you made me realize I, uh --

776
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:47,740
我想好好享受生活
I want to enjoy my life, you know?

777
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:54,290
怎么了  说句话啊
Okay, what? Say something.

778
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:07,670
你...
You're...

779
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:18,040
安德鲁斯医生来电

780
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:25,920
你好
Hello?

781
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,380
杰瑞德  我是安德鲁斯医生
Jared, this is Dr. Andrews.

782
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:28,320
方便说话吗
Do you have a moment?

783
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,670
当然
Yeah, of course.

784
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:31,880
科利医生今天来找我了
Dr. Coyle approached me today.

785
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,550
他跟我说他觉得很惭愧
He told me that he feels awful

786
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:35,680
无论是他对布朗医生的态度
about the way he treated Dr. Browne

787
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,500
还是这件事对你造成的影响
and how it came to affect you,

788
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:40,620
他请我重新考虑解雇你的事
and he asked me to reconsider your termination.

789
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,350
你也应该知道
You should also know

790
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:44,630
梅伦德斯医生也为你说了好话
that Dr. Melendez spoke in support of you, as well.

791
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,800
谢谢你告诉我这些
Thank you for letting me know.

792
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:49,720
你为自己的所作所为承担了全部责任
I was impressed by the integrity you demonstrated

793
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:52,300
这一点我很钦佩
by taking full responsibility for your actions.

794
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,150
如果你需要我为你推荐的话
And I'm certainly willing to make that clear

795
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,740
我愿意向任何其他医院的主管
to any administrators at another hospital

796
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:59,060
明确表示我的态度
if you need me as a reference,

797
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,690
但我不会让你复职
but I won't reinstate you.

798
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,750
使用暴力触犯了医院的底线
Physical assault is a line

799
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:06,400
我不能为任何人破例
I'm just not willing to let anyone cross.

800
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:07,980
我明白
I understand.

801
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:09,110
抱歉
I'm sorry.

802
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:11,450
保重
Take care.

803
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:20,660
她们什么时候能醒过来
When will they wake up?

804
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:28,880
按理说应该已经醒了
They should've already.

805
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:32,880
肖恩
Shaun?

806
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:37,510
肖恩
Shaun.

807
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:15,140
BGM: 14 Faces by Lewis Del Mar

808
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:12,800
? Our sharp teeth are the only light ?

809
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,130
? I drink the whole moon dry ?

810
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:16,930
? 'Cause all my friends are metalheads ?

811
00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:18,550
? Swear they'll never catch us dead ?

812
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,930
? Split up when the police come ?

813
00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:26,020
? Yeah, running used to get me high, high ?

814
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:29,170
? Now I only feel tired ?
