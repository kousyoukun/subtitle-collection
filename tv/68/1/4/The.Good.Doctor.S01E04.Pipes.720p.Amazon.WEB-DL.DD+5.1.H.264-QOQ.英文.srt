20
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:02,720
Previously on "The Good Doctor"...

21
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:03,380
I'm your neighbor.

22
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:06,190
I'm in the middle of "Uncharted," And I'm dead.

23
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:07,590
Can I borrow some triple A's?

24
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:08,820
It's kind of silly, isn't it?

25
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,680
Our relationship... that we're hiding it.

26
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,980
We don't have a relationship.

27
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,380
We have sex.

28
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,450
- You're late. - No, the bus was late.

29
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:17,620
I did nothing wrong. The bus...

30
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:19,160
Yeah. This is gonna work out great.

31
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,910
So you're treating him like anybody else?

32
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,570
You have any idea how many patients he's scared the crap out of today?

33
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:24,490
So teach him.

34
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:26,370
I'm teaching you both that he doesn't belong.

35
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:29,670
I hear you got Shaun off scut and back into surgery.

36
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,020
You figure you'll give him a little authority,

37
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:32,490
he'll screw something up.

38
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,070
Either way, if he succeeds,

39
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:35,320
I'm the guy who just backed him.

40
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,910
And if he fails, I'm the president.

41
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,710
Hello. I've looked everywhere.

42
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:20,120
All right, I'm here now. We'll...

43
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,420
we'll just keep looking until you find it.

44
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,710
Why is the furniture in the middle of the room?

45
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,890
I know I packed it. I made a list.

46
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,620
"Star-tip screwdriver."

47
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:32,910
Look, it's checked.

48
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,070
It's checked.

49
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,050
Maybe you... you threw it out with the newspapers

50
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:48,880
you used to pack the dishes?

51
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,440
I packed with bubble wrap.

52
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,520
It's safer. And you can see through it.

53
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,330
Of course you did.

54
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:56,180
Shaun, there's a hardware store up the road.

55
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,230
You can buy a new one.

56
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:58,760
I don't want a new screwdriver!

57
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,030
I want my screwdriver!

58
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,170
Stop it!

59
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,200
It's the middle of the... I'm sorry.

60
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,630
I just shouldn't have yelled. J-Just...

61
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:12,140
Let's just take a moment. Sit down, please.

62
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:20,700
You know what? We can use this for now, okay?

63
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:24,680
I can't stay here.

64
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:25,890
Of course you can.

65
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,440
- It'll be fine. - I can't stay here.

66
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:29,600
The...dishwasher doesn't dry,

67
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:31,680
the shower drain has someone else's hair in it.

68
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,500
And the crisper drawer keeps coming off the track?

69
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,420
I assume that's what you were fixing.

70
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,240
I forgot.

71
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,500
Of course you forgot.

72
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:42,800
It's understandable.

73
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,710
You've been working your ass off.

74
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,260
You're exhausted. You're under a lot of stress.

75
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:48,970
There's a super in the building.

76
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:51,510
You can call him anytime.

77
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,860
Just make a list of the things you need repaired.

78
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,390
Later, Shaun. Later.

79
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,930
Later, Shaun!

80
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:00,260
Leave it now. Go to bed.

81
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,090
36 years old, 22 weeks pregnant.

82
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:18,410
Ultrasound at 16 weeks revealed a tumor on the fetus' tailbone.

83
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:19,930
Mom's got antiphospholipid syndrome.

84
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,170
Makes surgery high risk.

85
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,460
Also makes pregnancy high risk.

86
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,360
She's had three miscarriages.

87
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,540
We need to do an ultrasound and MRI

88
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,570
to measure the tumor's growth rate.

89
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,280
Late bus doesn't explain why you're showing up tired

90
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,260
after you just had 12 hours off.

91
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,620
We're all tired.

92
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,500
Our last shift was 36 hours.

93
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,770
I'm not interested in debating the shift schedule with you.

94
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:42,360
But I am curious why you always feel the need to defend him.

95
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,870
Well, we're all on the same team.

96
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:46,820
Yes.

97
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,450
But you're all quarterbacks.

98
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,480
And when training camp is over,

99
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,220
there's only gonna be one starter.

100
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:03,340
The crown-rump length of the fetus is 21.5 centimeters.

101
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,930
The diameter of the tumor is...

102
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,610
10.6 centimeters.

103
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:14,510
Half the size of the fetus.

104
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,670
The tumor's grown.

105
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:20,570
It's not cancer, but it is monopolizing the blood supply,

106
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:22,490
which is weakening the fetus' heart.

107
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:27,050
I'm sorry, but there's no chance it would survive long enough to be viable.

108
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,300
The safest course is to terminate the pregnancy.

109
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,170
If we were interested in the "safest course,"

110
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:38,310
we wouldn't be on our third "second opinion."

111
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,090
Please, Dr. Melendez,

112
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:41,650
we want whatever will save our baby.

113
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,890
Dr. Wright told us you've done fetal surgery

114
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,550
to remove this type of tumor before.

115
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:47,880
And without the tumor, our baby would be healthy.

116
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,230
Your antiphospholipid syndrome

117
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,610
makes a long surgery extremely dangerous.

118
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,420
There's a high chance for blood clots,

119
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,440
which could have fatal consequences for you.

120
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,940
We're willing to take that risk.

121
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:02,070
Saving the fetus doesn't do any good if the mother dies in the process.

122
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:04,170
I've had three miscarriages.

123
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,820
If I have to go through that again, I might as well be dead.

124
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,320
- Barb. - It's true.

125
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,310
No, it's not.

126
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:12,770
You're the strongest woman I've ever met.

127
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,270
We'll get through this.

128
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:16,420
We will. And... and then we'll try again.

129
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,650
We could manage clotting risk pre-operatively

130
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:21,250
with an infusion of unfractionated heparin.

131
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,620
Never contradict me in front of a patient again.

132
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,600
I didn't.

133
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,110
I agree with your assessment of the risks.

134
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,820
I suggested a way we could mitigate them.

135
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,350
Not in front of the patient.

136
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:39,330
We're not in front of the patient now.

137
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,800
I was just reading about a new technique

138
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,760
for transesophageal echocardiography monitoring.

139
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,230
If there's a cardiac issue,

140
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:49,070
it would give us an early warning.

141
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,430
Let's get her prepped. ASAP.

142
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,150
I want J.L. on anesthesia.

143
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,810
And let the neo-natal nursing supervisor

144
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:15,770
know that I want to do a full run-through.

145
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,410
Damn it.

146
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,020
Yes?

147
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:21,490
Well, we're a little busy up here, too.

148
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,780
All right. I'll send someone.

149
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,010
Andrews is covering for Lim in the ER.

150
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:28,710
He has a patient who needs a boil lanced.

151
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,610
A plastic surgeon can't lance a boil?

152
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:32,880
Plastic surgeons can. Chief surgeons don't.

153
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,000
You and Murphy.

154
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:35,870
What?

155
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,250
It was our ideas that convinced you to do the fetal surgery,

156
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,760
and now you're punishing us with Andrews' scut work?

157
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:43,800
You're not getting punished.

158
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:44,880
He is.

159
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,620
For being late. Again.

160
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,720
But I don't trust him alone with a patient.

161
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,320
And since you like to defend him

162
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,330
and seem to know how to communicate with him...

163
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,520
Hurry back.

164
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,830
Olivia Hartman?

165
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:02,800
Yes, ma'am.

166
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,830
I mean Doctor.

167
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,780
You're 18?

168
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:07,650
Yes, ma'am.

169
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:08,740
Where's the boil?

170
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:11,870
It's... It's down there.

171
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:12,670
Down where?

172
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:15,680
Shaun. It's, um, on her labia.

173
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,100
Is it painful?

174
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,270
Like I used a bowling ball for a tampon.

175
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,920
Okay. Boils shouldn't hurt that much.

176
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,230
Okay if we take a look?

177
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:26,710
Okay.

178
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,610
If you just scoot down,

179
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,470
put your feet in the stirrups...

180
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:34,580
Great.

181
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,970
The swelling is fairly localized.

182
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:41,910
Extreme pain that's out of proportion to the visible injury

183
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:44,430
could mean you have necrotizing flesh-eating bacteria.

184
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,190
What?!

185
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,490
I'm gonna use the heparin pre-operatively

186
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:51,970
and a T.E.E. monitor.

187
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,000
Still not enough.

188
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,320
The risk of a heart attack or stroke was thoroughly explained.

189
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,940
The patient still wants the surgery.

190
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,330
She wants it? Or you want it?

191
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:03,480
Yes,

192
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,100
saving a fetus' life would be good news for me.

193
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,210
Any other questions?

194
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,150
Or insults?

195
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,690
Relax. I'm not insulting you.

196
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,500
Of course you want to do the surgery.

197
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,240
But you do surgeries like this,

198
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,780
some patients are going to die.

199
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,920
And then our department's success rate goes down,

200
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,750
and then our funding goes down,

201
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,200
and then you can't do surgeries like this.

202
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,890
So if your judgment is clouded in any way, just --

203
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:27,820
It's not.

204
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:30,900
Okay.

205
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,120
I'm sorry. I know this hurts,

206
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,650
but I really do need to insert a speculum for this part of the exam.

207
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,380
If I really have what he says,

208
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,720
does that mean you have to cut off my --

209
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,820
No. No, as I said,

210
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:54,060
the abscess is most likely the result of an untreated chlamydia infection.

213
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,530
We'll drain the abscess,

214
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:56,940
give you antibiotics.

215
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,010
You'll be fine.

216
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,650
I'm -- I'm sorry.

217
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,850
{\an3}The inflamed Bartholin gland is causing the ischiocavernosus muscle

218
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,830
to spasm and pinch the labial nerve.

219
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,730
You need to start with a more upward angle.

220
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:10,750
Can I try?

221
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,850
I think it's better if I do this.

222
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:20,280
Yeah, okay. Fine.

223
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,070
Can we, uh, call your parents? Let them know --

224
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:29,810
No.

225
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,680
I'm 18. I'm an adult.

226
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,700
Even adults need emotional support.

227
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,830
Someone to drive them home after surgery.

228
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:38,380
Uh, I'm gonna take a taxi.

229
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,290
I have money.

230
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,140
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.

231
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:45,300
25% of college students contract an STD before graduation.

232
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:47,470
I'm not embarrassed.

233
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:49,220
And I know all about STDs.

234
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,220
I get tested every 30 days.

235
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:55,640
There's no necrosis on the vaginal wall or cervix.

236
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,300
You got it in already?

237
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,690
Yes. It's definitely not flesh-eating bacteria.

238
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:02,270
- I was wrong. - Thank God.

239
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:05,250
You do need surgery to drain the Bartholin gland abscess.

240
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,750
Why do you get an STD test every 30 days?

241
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:10,470
I have to. For work.

242
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:13,590
I do porn.

243
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:18,170
The umbilical is 19 inches,

244
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:21,480
which will allow us to remove the fetus via Caesarean

245
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,430
and rest it in its mother's lap while I excise the tumor.

246
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:26,170
Now, the hard part

247
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,770
will be reinserting the fetus afterwards.

248
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:31,910
We can't overstretch the uterine wall,

249
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:34,900
and we must be certain that every suture is tight enough

250
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:39,160
to handle four more months of kicks and thrown elbows.

251
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:41,400
Do you have a minute?

252
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,340
Can it wait?

253
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:44,160
No.

254
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,280
I don't want to do it.

255
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,630
Have you talked to your wife?

256
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:02,270
Yes, but she's not thinking rationally.

257
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,820
You heard her say she'd rather die than lose this baby.

258
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,110
I'm sorry, but husbands don't have veto power

259
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:08,870
over their wife's medical decisions.

260
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,780
A husband can't stop you from operating on his wife.

261
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:16,750
But a father can stop you from operating on his child.

262
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:31,250
What kind of porn?

263
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,210
I'm sorry.

264
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:37,390
I was too busy doing all the labs and imaging she needed for surgery.

265
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,310
I forgot to ask for her résumé.

266
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:41,080
I just mean, is she an actual actress,

267
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,640
like in stuff with a story, or...

268
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,720
Do they even make porn with stories anymore?

269
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,840
Sometimes.

270
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:48,380
You watch porn?

271
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,690
Why wouldn't he?

272
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:51,900
I don't know. He just seems...

273
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,450
He's a guy. All guys watch porn.

274
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,760
You finished with Andrews' patient?

275
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,260
No. It wasn't a boil.

276
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:00,730
It's a large Bartholin gland abscess that's pressing on her pudendal nerve.

277
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:02,830
Which apparently does interest a chief surgeon.

278
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:05,250
We're gonna assist Andrews when he drains it first thing in the morning.

279
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,330
We just thought we'd check with you.

280
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,140
Go home. And sleep.

281
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,710
Not play video games or whatever it is keeping you up.

282
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,080
I don't think it's video games.

283
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,640
You can head out, too. It's been a long day.

284
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,850
- But what about... - Fetal surgery's been put on hold.

285
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:18,680
What? Why?

286
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,590
Go home.

287
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:27,460
Once the fetus is removed from the uterus,

288
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,210
one could argue that it becomes a child.

289
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:30,350
That's ridiculous.

290
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,430
There are numerous legal precedents...

291
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:34,500
That guarantee the mother's right to choose.

292
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,210
It's her body. It's her control.

293
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:38,390
I'm completely comfortable going ahead with this surgery.

294
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:38,940
As am I.

295
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,710
I never was, and I certainly am not now.

296
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:42,910
I'm sorry. Until we're certain there is no liability

297
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:45,030
connected to parental consent, neither am I.

298
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,320
Well, the one thing I think we can all agree on

299
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,260
is that the mother has the power to do nothing.

300
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,250
And if she doesn't terminate

301
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,290
or have the surgery to remove the tumor...

302
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:57,650
A fetus with a massive tumor will die...

303
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:59,440
inside a patient with APS.

304
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,040
Then the mother would die, too, right?

305
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,660
So we do nothing, and they both die.

306
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:08,670
Or we can do something that's legally and ethically complicated,

307
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,280
and maybe they both live.

308
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,290
The board has approved the surgery.

309
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,510
Thank you.

310
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,300
- Barb, please... - Mark, stop.

311
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,700
- If you loved me... - No.

312
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,110
- No, do not say that. - No, it's true.

313
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,270
If you really loved me...

314
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:44,300
I'm trying to protect you because I love you.

315
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:47,270
I don't need your protection.

316
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,620
I need your support.

317
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:55,100
We'll start prepping you first thing in the morning.

318
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,010
Try and get some sleep.

319
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:58,400
Thank you.

320
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,690
I still can't believe it.

321
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:18,620
That 18-year-old college students do porn?

322
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,460
She's just not the type.

323
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,560
How do you know what "type" she is? You just met her.

324
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,330
Did one medical history and pelvic exam.

325
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:29,030
What?

326
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:31,600
Nothing.

327
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,790
No, go ahead.

328
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:34,980
Tell me all the reasons why I'm wrong.

329
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:42,590
I volunteered at a shelter for runaway teens when I was at high school.

330
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,870
Got to know a lot of sex workers.

331
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:52,520
They're not all the same, but they do have the same...

332
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:53,980
armor.

333
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,360
I don't believe it.

334
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,830
- You think I'm lying? - No.

335
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:02,090
No, I think you just opened up to me,

336
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:04,060
actually shared something personal.

337
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:07,590
It was high-school community service. It's not a big deal.

338
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:10,200
Oh, no, it's a big deal. This is huge.

339
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:12,640
- I am peeling the onion. - Shut up.

340
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,440
Actually, it's more like hacking through a coconut with a dull machete, but...

341
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:17,790
"Dull" is right. Very dull.

342
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,900
It feels good, doesn't it?

343
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,470
You should do it more often.

344
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:28,370
How about you stop worrying about what I won't do

345
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,240
and just enjoy what I will?

346
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,910
Do you think she's of sound mind?

347
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,480
You really want to talk about work right now?

348
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,690
She's basically threatening to commit suicide.

349
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:50,710
She's not suicidal.

350
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:53,520
She's... She's just desperate to have a child.

351
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,020
This is probably her last chance.

352
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,330
She could adopt.

353
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,820
- It's not the same. - Really?

354
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,240
You don't think there's a difference?

355
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,220
No, I don't.

356
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:05,460
Carrying a fetus in your body for nine months.

357
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:08,170
You don't think that creates a unique relationship?

358
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:10,570
I think every relationship is unique.

359
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,000
Yeah, of course.

360
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:13,710
What are you saying?

361
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:15,530
I just think it's selfish.

362
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,670
I mean, for her to go through so much,

363
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,870
to put your husband through so much,

364
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,680
just so you can have a certain experience

365
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,450
when there are other ways.

366
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,920
Yeah, okay.

367
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,680
But...you want children, though, right?

368
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,310
We've talked about this before.

369
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:32,430
Yes, I-I want children.

370
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,660
But our children.

371
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:35,460
Like, from you getting pregnant.

372
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:36,470
Yes.

373
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:40,490
But what if that doesn't happen?

374
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:43,070
What if I couldn't get pregnant

375
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:46,300
or if I decided that I didn't want to?

376
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,210
That I wanted to adopt instead?

377
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,890
Is there something you're not telling me?

378
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,300
Actually, there is.

379
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,070
When we're in meetings together,

380
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:57,230
don't ever call my ideas "ridiculous."

381
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:58,960
Come on, I'm being serious.

382
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,880
So am I.

383
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:04,720
You're right. I'm sorry.

384
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,140
It won't happen again.

385
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,470
Geez, you scared me.

386
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:31,970
- What're you reading? - Nothing.

387
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,930
- Can I read it? - No.

388
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:35,440
- Why? - Because.

389
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,570
Why?

390
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:37,910
Because.

391
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:39,620
Why?

392
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,620
Because there's nothing to read.

393
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:46,370
Just pictures.

394
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:48,070
Where'd you get this?

395
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:49,420
Colleen Myers.

396
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:50,860
Her dad has so many in his closet,

397
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:53,210
he doesn't even notice when she takes a few.

398
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:54,920
She's pretty.

399
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:56,830
She sure is.

400
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:00,940
It's bedtime. That means lights out.

401
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,710
I missed my stop.

402
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:21,870
I missed my stop!

403
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:23,210
Lynwood Place!

404
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:25,900
I need to get off at Lynwood Place.

405
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,300
Well, then you should've been paying attention

406
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,220
when I stopped at Lynwood Place.

407
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,170
Next stop's gonna be even further away,

408
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:33,310
so if I were you...

409
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:22,810
Shaun?

410
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,520
Are you okay?

411
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:26,400
Yes.

412
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,450
Are you waiting for someone?

413
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:29,900
No.

414
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:36,220
I'm horrible at directions, too.

415
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,300
Every time I exit a BART station,

416
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,880
I walk like three blocks before I realize

417
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,840
I'm going the wrong direction.

418
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,970
You're lucky I actually made it to the gym.

419
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,800
I like to go when it's not crowded,

420
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,060
but it's so hard to motivate after work.

421
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,120
Half the time I end up not...

422
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,180
You stink.

423
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:57,260
I know. I'm disgusting.

424
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,340
But I can't shower there.

425
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,640
I'm terrified of foot fungus.

426
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:04,410
Hey, you know, as long as we're tossing out truth grenades,

427
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:06,160
you suck at being a neighbor.

428
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,360
First, you take back your batteries,

429
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:10,340
and then you wake me up in the middle of the night

430
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,850
stomping around and banging on pipes.

431
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:13,960
What the hell's up with that?

432
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:15,310
My sink drips.

433
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:17,800
I couldn't sleep, so I tried to fix it.

434
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,090
Then I couldn't find my screwdriver, which made me anxious.

435
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:24,050
You kept me up because you were anxious about a screwdriver?

436
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,950
Yes. I was very anxious.

437
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,170
You're funny.

438
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:32,640
I stink. You're anxious.

439
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,370
You always say exactly what's on your mind.

440
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:38,420
It's the total opposite of most guys.

441
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:40,980
It's nice.

442
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:51,850
Good night.

443
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,430
And don't go fixing any faucets tonight.

444
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:56,640
That's Armen's job.

445
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:19,160
This is a list of repairs I need for my apartment.

446
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,100
Number 33.

447
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,950
What the hell is your problem?

448
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,020
Sorry. Hello.

449
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,260
My name is Shaun Murphy. It's very nice to meet you.

450
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:31,980
No, it's not nice to meet me at 12:40 a.m.

451
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:32,850
Yes.

452
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:37,280
Dr. Glassman said I can call you any time I need something fixed.

453
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,690
Who the hell is Dr. Glassman?

454
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:41,810
He's the president at San Jose St. Bonaventure Hospital.

455
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:43,300
I'm a surgical resident there.

456
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,840
Well, I don't care if you're St. Bonaventure himself.

457
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:48,280
Unless it's a fire or flood,

458
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,100
I only work 9:00 to 5:00.

459
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:51,460
I'll...

460
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:53,950
try and come back tomorrow between those times.

461
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:57,790
You already woke me up. Just give me the damn list.

462
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:02,560
It's my fault.

463
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:06,490
I should've known you would take what I said literally.

464
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,390
It's okay.

465
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,240
Actually, you know what, Shaun?

466
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,310
It's not my fault.

467
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,890
It's your responsibility. You're smart.

468
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:16,170
You should be able to use your common sense.

469
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,520
When somebody says something,

470
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,780
you should figure out what they really mean.

471
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:24,090
And when things don't go exactly how you expected them,

472
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:25,320
navigate that.

473
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:33,880
There's a thing called a Personal Support Worker.

474
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,130
Think of it like a home health aide.

475
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:37,190
No, thank you.

476
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:38,710
I can take care of myself.

477
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:40,680
Everybody needs a little help now and then.

478
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,280
I-I'm thinking of asking them to give me one.

479
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:45,220
I've lived by myself a long time.

480
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,970
In Casper, Wyoming.

481
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,240
Everybody looked out for you in Casper.

482
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,920
Everybody looks out for everybody in Casper.

483
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,600
This is San Jose. It's a big city.

484
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,670
And residency is a whole lot more demanding than medical --

485
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:56,800
I don't need an aide.

486
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,820
We're just talking, Shaun.

487
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:59,850
- I don't need an aide! - Okay, okay.

488
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:02,630
- Okay. - Okay.

489
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:03,480
Okay.

490
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,570
We'll table it for some other time.

491
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:12,420
Let's enjoy our breakfast, okay?

492
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:21,470
Mr. Allen?

493
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:25,100
I'm trying to convince her to save herself.

494
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,100
I don't want to roll the dice with my wife's life.

495
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,240
But she does.

496
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,270
We're gonna start prepping her now,

497
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,250
and she goes into the O.R. in a few hours.

498
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,000
I understand why she's desperate.

499
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,040
But not why you are.

500
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:39,450
If she dies, it's your fault.

501
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,660
And what if she lives?

502
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:45,860
You're gonna have a wife and child who need you,

503
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,750
and you keep driving her out of your life.

504
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,170
I'm not desperate.

505
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:51,930
I'm confident.

506
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:54,360
Which should make you feel better.

507
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:05,830
Retraction.

508
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:07,860
I'll make the incision,

509
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:10,430
and then I want you to insert the Word catheter.

510
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:13,290
Good job on the pelvic exam, Dr. Murphy.

511
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:15,030
With all this swelling, it couldn't have been easy.

512
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:15,850
Thank you.

513
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:17,160
How do you know who...

514
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:18,840
Oh, I have my ways.

515
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:20,060
Like Santa.

516
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,160
I told him.

517
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:22,560
No presents for you.

518
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:23,840
Insert the drain.

519
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:27,740
But I'm curious.

520
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:30,800
How could a guy who can't even shake a co-worker's hand

521
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,570
be comfortable doing a pelvic exam?

522
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:35,870
People squeeze too hard. It hurts.

523
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:37,950
Send this to the lab for culture.

524
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:42,420
So, I'm guessing you're not that into hugs.

525
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,690
I don't like to be squeezed.

526
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:46,630
Well, what if it's somebody you like?

527
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:48,180
Or somebody you love?

528
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:49,570
Have you ever had a girlfriend?

529
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:54,640
I almost kissed a girl. Once.

530
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,990
Well, you know what they say --

531
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:57,410
If at first you don't succeed...

532
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,960
Are you trying to mock me or encourage me?

533
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:02,710
I'm trying to get to know you

534
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:06,100
so I know when I should mock and when I should encourage.

535
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,310
When's the right time to mock you?

536
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:17,080
Press harder on that abscess.

537
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,230
It should have drained by now.

538
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:19,500
Something's wrong.

539
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:23,060
The gland's evacuated, but the swelling's not going down.

540
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,540
Heart rate and BP are stable.

541
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,160
Can I get a little more light, please?

542
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,980
- Damn. - What is it?

543
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:33,700
The swelling isn't going down because there's a mass beneath the abscess.

544
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,940
And it's not just pressing on the pudendal nerve --

545
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:37,490
It's totally engulfed it.

546
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:38,250
That's bad.

547
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:39,230
Very bad.

548
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,010
You're done already?

549
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:55,250
We were able to drain the abscess.

550
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,370
I already feel better.

551
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:59,100
That's only because of the pain meds.

552
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,650
The reason the pain was so severe

553
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:02,310
was because it wasn't just an abscess.

554
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,310
There's perineal myoma underneath.

555
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:05,800
What's that?

556
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,330
A fibroid tumor.

557
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:13,230
It's not cancerous, but it is wrapped around the nerve.

558
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,840
We need to remove the tumor,

559
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:18,510
but to do that, we will have to sever the nerve.

560
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:22,470
You'll lose all feeling in your genitals.

561
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:24,380
I'm so sorry.

562
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:26,910
I knew it.

563
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,180
God's punishing me.

564
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,760
No, absolutely not.

565
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,860
This is just a random growth...

566
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,080
You're religious?

567
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,320
Yes.

568
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,620
Or at least I used to be.

569
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,190
I haven't thought about God in a really long time.

570
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,140
But being in here...

571
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:49,320
You sure you don't want us to call your parents?

572
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,280
No. I couldn't bear to see the look on their faces.

573
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:55,930
Especially my dad's.

574
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:58,600
Well, that's what parents are for.

575
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:01,750
So you don't have to do these things alone.

576
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:04,790
Could you tell your father you're a whore?

577
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:09,410
You made a mistake. That is all.

578
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,860
- Patient vitals? - Stable.

579
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,260
- Fetus? - Stable.

580
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:20,550
Okay.

581
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,100
Is everybody ready?

582
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,090
Knife.

583
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,130
Retractor.

584
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:53,290
Okay.

585
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:55,710
Cutting into the uterus.

586
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:02,680
T.E.E. is showing anterior wall hypokinesis.

587
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,560
Systolic pressure 90. Get me a Swan.

588
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,220
I.V. function is decreasing. She's having a heart attack.

589
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,460
I need you to close the incision.

590
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:09,720
- On it. Needle driver. - Get a fluoroscope in here!

591
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,320
I'm gonna prep her for a balloon pump.

592
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:15,720
Barbara?

593
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:19,450
There was a complication during surgery.

594
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:22,010
A blood clot blocked an artery in your heart.

595
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:23,790
We were able to catch it in time.

596
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,110
And my baby?

597
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,620
The fetus is stable.

598
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:30,250
The M.I. happened before we opened the uterus.

599
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:32,950
So, we're right back where we started?

600
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,480
You just had a heart attack.

601
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,480
I don't care.

602
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,140
There is no other option now.

603
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:40,700
If we don't terminate and the fetus dies in utero,

604
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:43,200
the resulting clots will overwhelm your heart and brain.

605
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,380
Which is exactly why we need to try again.

606
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,500
What're you talking about?

607
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,930
You need to remove the tumor.

608
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,940
You begged me not to do the surgery before.

609
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,870
I thought I could talk her out of it then.

610
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:59,200
Now I know I can't.

611
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:02,770
Either you do it, or she dies.

612
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,710
Before, if we got sued,

613
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:09,440
we'd at least have one of them on our side,

614
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,470
but now, with them both aligned --

615
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:13,700
Can they sue us for not operating?

616
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,980
They could argue that we abandoned care.

617
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,330
We're still offering care.

618
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:18,660
Just not the care that they want.

619
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:19,900
Which is your fault.

620
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:23,440
If you hadn't offered her hope to begin with,

621
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,980
we might have been able to reason with her.

622
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,070
How's the pain around the incision?

623
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,640
5 out of 10.

624
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:29,870
I'll up the dosage.

625
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,260
Any chest pain?

626
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,730
No. My heart actually feels fine.

627
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:35,700
Good.

628
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:43,810
If she doesn't want to terminate, there's nothing we can do.

629
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:45,100
So we just send her home to die?

630
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:46,170
It is her decision.

631
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:48,690
We could tell her we were going ahead with the fetal surgery.

632
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:49,700
But once she's under --

633
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,200
I'm gonna pretend you never said that.

634
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,800
If it's the only chance to save her life --

635
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,290
This is exactly what I'm talking about.

636
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:57,630
You wouldn't lie to convince a suicidal person to climb down off the ledge?

637
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:00,030
Knowingly lying to a patient about a major medical surgery --

638
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:01,070
Okay, okay! Hey!

639
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,560
Lying to a patient is one thing.

640
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,530
Performing surgery without their consent --

641
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:07,070
It's unethical and illegal.

642
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,210
And insane.

643
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,430
I just...

644
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,800
I don't want to do this.

645
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:18,580
It's not our only option.

646
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,980
You want me to attempt the fetal surgery again?

647
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,500
If it's the only way to save her life.

648
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,560
The first time, it was the only way to save her life.

649
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,920
But a second heart attack one day after the first

650
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,780
- will kill her. - Maybe not.

651
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:31,530
I am so sorry to interrupt, but I...

652
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:33,210
I have an idea.

653
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:36,940
What if we kill her before she kills herself?

654
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,380
We'll stop your heart

655
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:45,220
and put you on a bypass machine for the duration of the surgery.

656
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:46,360
You can't have a heart attack

657
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,040
if your heart's not beating to begin with.

658
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,170
It takes the most significant danger off the table.

659
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:52,410
But aren't the clots a danger to her brain, as well?

660
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:54,680
This doesn't completely eliminate every risk,

661
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,230
but it does reduce the biggest one.

662
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:00,230
Thank you.

663
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,180
We'll do it first thing in the morning.

664
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:35,570
You fixed my sink!

665
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:37,630
Do you know how to tell time?

666
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:39,120
You fixed my sink!

667
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,970
You're welcome. Now go away.

668
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:42,460
It was not on the list!

669
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:45,280
The faucet. It was not on the list.

670
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,750
You weren't supposed to touch it.

671
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:51,130
So after I fix everything you woke me up for,

672
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:53,040
then I go out of my way to fix something el--

673
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,890
It was not on the list because I'd already fixed it.

674
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:57,760
Well, you fixed it wrong.

675
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,170
Because it was still dripping.

676
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:00,400
I need it to drip.

677
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:02,720
At the same rate as my sink in Casper.

678
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,010
It was too slow before.

679
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:05,500
Now I have to fix it all over again.

680
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,540
It's not fair.

681
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:08,510
I'm done.

682
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:10,340
If you don't like your faucet

683
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:13,100
or anything else in your apartment? Move.

684
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:16,510
If you knock on this door again after 5:00 p.m.,

685
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:18,380
I'm gonna knock your teeth out.

- Nerves are like pipes! - Shaun, th-- this --

709
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:36,550
We need to sever the pudendal nerve to excise the myoma,

710
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:37,960
but if we reconnect the ends...

711
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,070
The tumor is 4 centimeters in diameter.

712
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:42,190
That's way too wide of a gap to reconnect the ends,

713
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,390
and nerves don't stretch.

714
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,950
We don't need to stretch it.

715
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:47,510
We can connect the distal end of the pudendal nerve

716
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:50,310
to the branch of the femoral cutaneous nerve from her inner thigh.

717
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:56,600
Would you rather lose feeling in your thigh or genitals?

718
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,550
Thigh, definitely.

719
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:01,240
Is he right?

720
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,580
Can we do that?

721
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:06,060
It probably would've been better to discuss this prior

722
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,880
to meeting with the patient,

723
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:10,150
but, yes, I think it could work.

724
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,540
Cut the suture.

725
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,630
Grafted nerve's in place. Let's see if it will conduct.

726
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:37,620
Conduction electrodes are in position.

727
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,760
Send a pulse.

728
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:43,970
Again.

729
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,100
Again.

730
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,050
- Again. - Okay, Murphy, we get it.

731
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:50,400
Your idea worked.

732
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,780
Good job. Both of you.

733
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,270
- Thanks. - Thank you.

734
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:58,050
I'm guessing Melendez doesn't let you know this enough,

735
00:35:58,050 --> 00:36:00,140
but you both are doing a great job.

736
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:03,440
And if either of you needs anything, even just to talk,

737
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,680
my door's always open.

738
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:07,670
4-0 Vicryl.

739
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:08,580
Yes doctor.

740
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:09,720
4-0 Vicryl.

741
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,770
She's on bypass.

742
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:17,640
Cross clamping the aorta.

743
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,610
You ready?

744
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:28,660
- Flush the heart. - Flushing.

745
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:38,730
Let's prep her for C-section.

746
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:49,630
Dr. Andrews.

747
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:52,710
The operation went perfectly.

748
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,550
But I don't feel anything down there.

749
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:56,580
You're still on the meds, so it's gonna --

750
00:36:56,580 --> 00:37:00,330
It's going to take six months to a year to regain complete sensation.

751
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:03,910
It'll take a while for your brain to figure out what we did.

752
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,110
But the grafted nerve is fully conducting.

753
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:07,440
You're gonna be fine.

754
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:08,590
Thank you.

755
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:12,320
- Can you do me a favor? - Sure.

756
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,150
- Call my parents. - Absolutely.

757
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:26,820
- Knife. - Knife.

758
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:52,920
Bovie.

759
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:54,470
Bovie.

760
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,060
How're we on bypass?

761
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,860
- Dr. Kalu, you still with us? - Yeah.

762
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,350
Central venous pressure's good.

763
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:20,220
Bypass oxygen tension's 200.

764
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:22,940
Good. Repairing the fetal sacrum.

765
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,100
Gonna put this baby back where it belongs.

766
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:26,680
Baby?

767
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:30,220
That's the first time you didn't call it a fetus.

768
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:32,860
Just an expression.

769
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:45,990
I told you.

770
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:47,980
Yes, you did.

771
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:51,300
You're gonna need to stay in bed for the next four months...

772
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:54,060
but both you and your son's prognosis is excellent.

773
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:58,600
We wanted it to be a surprise.

774
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:01,730
Rookie mistake.

775
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:07,650
Yes!

776
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:10,720
We are definitely celebrating tonight.

777
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,740
Screw sleep, Murphy.

778
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:14,210
You are coming with us.

779
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:15,260
Where are you going?

780
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:17,620
- Out. We're gonna drink. - I'm not thirsty.

781
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:18,580
Don't be an idiot.

782
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:20,500
I just meant...

783
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:22,410
Come on, mate.

784
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,820
You just saved an 18-year-old girl's sex life.

785
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:26,710
And I saved two lives.

786
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:28,060
We are drinking.

787
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:31,930
Come on, Shaun.

788
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:35,800
Okay.

789
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:37,540

Don't worry. I'm not gonna tell anyone.

You smell like bubble gum.

811
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:59,480
I know. It's my lip gloss.

812

I like you, too.

816
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:21,710
I'll show you mine if you show me yours.

817

Come on. I'm curious.

818

You must be curious.

Can I have a kiss?

820
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,450
I want to know what it feels like.

821
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:37,940
I'll give you a kiss...

822
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,020
if you show me.

823
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:40,720
Show you what?

824
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:43,000
You know. Pull down your pants.

No.

No. I gotta go.

Oh, my God. I can't believe you were about to pull it out.
