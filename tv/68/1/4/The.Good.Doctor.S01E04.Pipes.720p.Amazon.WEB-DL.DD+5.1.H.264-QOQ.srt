「良医」前情回顾
Previously on "The Good Doctor"...

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:03,380
我是你的邻居
I'm your neighbor.

3
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:06,190
我正在玩「神秘海域」  但没电了
I'm in the middle of "Uncharted," And I'm dead.

4
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:07,590
能借我几粒七号电池吗
Can I borrow some triple A's?

5
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:08,820
有点傻吧
It's kind of silly, isn't it?

6
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,680
我是说我们在搞的地下情
Our relationship... that we're hiding it.

7
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,980
杰瑞德  我们没有「情」
We don't have a relationship.

8
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,380
只有「性」
We have sex.

9
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,450
-你迟到了  -不  是公交迟到了
- You're late. - No, the bus was late.

10
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:17,620
我没做错什么  公交...
I did nothing wrong. The bus...

11
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:19,160
好吧  这真是太棒了
Yeah. This is gonna work out great.

12
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,910
所以你对他是一视同仁吗
So you're treating him like anybody else?

13
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,570
你知道他今天把多少病人吓得要死吗
You have any idea how many patients he's scared the crap out of today?

14
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:24,490
那你就教他
So teach him.

15
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:26,370
我想教给你们两个的是他不属于这里
I'm teaching you both that he doesn't belong.

16
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:29,670
我听说你不让肖恩打杂  让他回了外科
I hear you got Shaun off scut and back into surgery.

17
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,020
你以为你给他一点权力
You figure you'll give him a little authority,

18
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:32,490
他肯定会捅出篓子
he'll screw something up.

19
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,070
总之  如果他成功了
Either way, if he succeeds,

20
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:35,320
我就是支持过他的人
I'm the guy who just backed him.

21
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,910
如果他失败了  我是院长
And if he fails, I'm the president.

22
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:42,400


23

你好  我到处都找遍了
Hello. I've looked everywhere.

40
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:20,120
好了  我来了  我们...
All right, I'm here now. We'll...

41
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,420
我们会一直找  找到它为止
we'll just keep looking until you find it.

42
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,710
家具怎么都在屋子中间
Why is the furniture in the middle of the room?

43
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,890
我知道我打包进来了  还列了单子
I know I packed it. I made a list.

44
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,620
「梅花螺丝刀」
"Star-tip screwdriver."

45
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:32,910
看  都打勾了
Look, it's checked.

46
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,070
打勾了
It's checked.

47
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,050
你可能把它跟用来打包餐盘的报纸
Maybe you... you threw it out with the newspapers

48
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:48,880
一起扔掉了
you used to pack the dishes?

49
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,440
我用气泡膜打包的
I packed with bubble wrap.

50
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,520
那样更保险  还能看清里面
It's safer. And you can see through it.

51
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,330
当然了
Of course you did.

52
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:56,180
肖恩  路边有一家五金店
Shaun, there's a hardware store up the road.

53
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,230
你可以买个新的
You can buy a new one.

54
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:58,760
我不想要新的螺丝刀
I don't want a new screwdriver!

55
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,030
我只想要我的螺丝刀
I want my screwdriver!

56
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,170
别闹了
Stop it!

57
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,200
现在是...抱歉
It's the middle of the... I'm sorry.

58
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,630
我不该吼你的  我只是...
I just shouldn't have yelled. J-Just...

59
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:12,140
先歇会儿吧  来坐下
Let's just take a moment. Sit down, please.

60
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:20,700
我们可以先用这个  好吗
You know what? We can use this for now, okay?

61
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:24,680
我没法住在这
I can't stay here.

62
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:25,890
你当然可以
Of course you can.

63
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,440
-没事的  -我没法住在这
- It'll be fine. - I can't stay here.

64
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:29,600
洗碗机没法烘干
The...dishwasher doesn't dry,

65
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:31,680
浴室地漏里有别人的头发
the shower drain has someone else's hair in it.

66
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,500
冰箱保鲜格也总是放不好
And the crisper drawer keeps coming off the track?

67
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,420
你之前就是在修理它吧
I assume that's what you were fixing.

68
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,240
我忘了
I forgot.

69
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,500
你当然忘了
Of course you forgot.

70
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:42,800
可以理解
It's understandable.

71
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,710
你一直忙得火烧屁股
You've been working your ass off.

72
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,260
你累坏了  压力太大
You're exhausted. You're under a lot of stress.

73
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:48,970
这里有楼层管理员
There's a super in the building.

74
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:51,510
你可以随时叫他帮忙
You can call him anytime.

75
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,860
列一张需要修理的东西清单就好
Just make a list of the things you need repaired.

76
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,390
晚点再写  肖恩  晚点
Later, Shaun. Later.

77
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,930
晚点  肖恩
Later, Shaun!

78
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:00,260
先别管了  睡觉去
Leave it now. Go to bed.

79
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,090
36岁  怀孕22周
36 years old, 22 weeks pregnant.

80
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:18,410
16周做超声时在胚胎尾椎处发现肿瘤
Ultrasound at 16 weeks revealed a tumor on the fetus' tailbone.

81
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:19,930
孕妇得了抗磷脂综合征
Mom's got antiphospholipid syndrome.

82
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,170
手术风险很大
Makes surgery high risk.

83
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,460
同时增大了妊娠的风险
Also makes pregnancy high risk.

84
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,360
她流产过三次
She's had three miscarriages.

85
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,540
我们需要做超声和核磁共振
We need to do an ultrasound and MRI

86
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,570
确定肿瘤的生长速度
to measure the tumor's growth rate.

87
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,280
公交迟到可解释不了你为何一脸倦意地出现
Late bus doesn't explain why you're showing up tired

88
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,260
你才刚休息了12小时
after you just had 12 hours off.

89
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,620
我们都很累
We're all tired.

90
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,500
刚值了36小时的班
Our last shift was 36 hours.

91
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,770
我没兴趣跟你争论值班安排
I'm not interested in debating the shift schedule with you.

92
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:42,360
但我很好奇你为什么总替他说话
But I am curious why you always feel the need to defend him.

93
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,870
我们是一个团队
Well, we're all on the same team.

94
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:46,820
没错
Yes.

95
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,450
但你们都是四分卫
But you're all quarterbacks.

96
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,480
等训练营结束后
And when training camp is over,

97
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,220
只有一人能上场比赛
there's only gonna be one starter.

98
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:03,340
胚胎的顶臀长度是21.5厘米
The crown-rump length of the fetus is 21.5 centimeters.

99
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,930
肿瘤的直径是
The diameter of the tumor is...

100
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,610
10.6厘米
10.6 centimeters.

101
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:14,510
有胚胎一半那么大
Half the size of the fetus.

102
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,670
肿瘤变大了
The tumor's grown.

103
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:20,570
不是恶性肿瘤  但垄断了供血
It's not cancer, but it is monopolizing the blood supply,

104
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:22,490
导致胚胎心脏弱化
which is weakening the fetus' heart.

105
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:27,050
很遗憾  但胚胎无法存活到可以生育的阶段
I'm sorry, but there's no chance it would survive long enough to be viable.

106
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,300
最安全的办法就是终止妊娠
The safest course is to terminate the pregnancy.

107
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,170
如果我们要的是「最安全的办法」
If we were interested in the "safest course,"

108
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:38,310
就不会连续三次来寻求「不同意见」了
we wouldn't be on our third "second opinion."

109
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,090
求你了  梅伦德斯医生
Please, Dr. Melendez,

110
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:41,650
只要能救我们的孩子  怎么做都行
we want whatever will save our baby.

111
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,890
怀特医生说你之前做过
Dr. Wright told us you've done fetal surgery

112
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,550
摘除这种肿瘤的胚胎手术
to remove this type of tumor before.

113
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:47,880
摘除肿瘤后  胚胎就健康了
And without the tumor, our baby would be healthy.

114
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,230
你的抗磷脂综合征
Your antiphospholipid syndrome

115
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,610
如果长时间手术会非常危险
makes a long surgery extremely dangerous.

116
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,420
很有可能出现血栓
There's a high chance for blood clots,

117
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,440
结果可能会危及你的性命
which could have fatal consequences for you.

118
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,940
我们愿意冒险一试
We're willing to take that risk.

119
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:02,070
如果母亲在手术中死亡  救胚胎又有何用
Saving the fetus doesn't do any good if the mother dies in the process.

120
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:04,170
我已经流产三次了
I've had three miscarriages.

121
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,820
如果再流产  我还不如去死
If I have to go through that again, I might as well be dead.

122
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,320
-芭芭拉  -真的
- Barb. - It's true.

123
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,310
不  不是的
No, it's not.

124
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:12,770
你是我见过的最坚强的女人
You're the strongest woman I've ever met.

125
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,270
我们会挺过去的
We'll get through this.

126
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:16,420
会的  到时我们再怀就是
We will. And... and then we'll try again.

127
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,650
可以通过注射普通肝素
We could manage clotting risk pre-operatively

128
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:21,250
在术前控制住血栓风险
with an infusion of unfractionated heparin.

129
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,620
以后别再当着病患的面拆我的台
Never contradict me in front of a patient again.

130
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,600
我没有
I didn't.

131
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,110
我赞同你的风险评估
I agree with your assessment of the risks.

132
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,820
所以才提出降低风险的办法
I suggested a way we could mitigate them.

133
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,350
别当着病患的面
Not in front of the patient.

134
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:39,330
现在没当着病患的面
We're not in front of the patient now.

135
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,800
我刚看到过可以监测
I was just reading about a new technique

136
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,760
经食管超声心动图的新技术
for transesophageal echocardiography monitoring.

137
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,230
如果患者出现心脏问题
If there's a cardiac issue,

138
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:49,070
我们就能提前知道
it would give us an early warning.

139
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,430
给她做好准备  越快越好
Let's get her prepped. ASAP.

142
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,150
让JL来负责麻醉
I want J.L. on anesthesia.

143
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,810
告诉新生儿护士长
And let the neo-natal nursing supervisor

144
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:15,770
我想做个全套预演
know that I want to do a full run-through.

145
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,410
该死
Damn it.

146
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,020
怎么
Yes?

147
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:21,490
我们这边也很忙
Well, we're a little busy up here, too.

148
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,780
好吧  我会派人过去
All right. I'll send someone.

149
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,010
安德鲁斯在急诊顶替利姆
Andrews is covering for Lim in the ER.

150
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:28,710
他有个患者需要挑疔
He has a patient who needs a boil lanced.

151
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,610
整形医师挑不了疔
A plastic surgeon can't lance a boil?

152
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:32,880
整形医师可以  但他是外科主任
Plastic surgeons can. Chief surgeons don't.

153
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,000
你和莫菲过去
You and Murphy.

154
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:35,870
什么
What?

155
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,250
是我们说服了你做胚胎手术
It was our ideas that convinced you to do the fetal surgery,

156
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,760
而你却罚我们去给安德鲁斯干杂活
and now you're punishing us with Andrews' scut work?

157
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:43,800
不是罚你
You're not getting punished.

158
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:44,880
是罚他
He is.

159
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,620
今天又迟到了
For being late. Again.

160
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,720
但我不放心让患者和他独自相处
But I don't trust him alone with a patient.

161
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,320
而既然你那么喜欢维护他
And since you like to defend him

162
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,330
看起来也知道如何和他沟通...
and seem to know how to communicate with him...

163
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,520
快去快回
Hurry back.

164
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,830
奥利维亚·哈特曼
Olivia Hartman?

165
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:02,800
是的  女士
Yes, ma'am.

166
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,830
我是说  医生
I mean Doctor.

167
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,780
你18岁
You're 18?

168
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:07,650
没错  女士
Yes, ma'am.

169
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:08,740
疔在哪
Where's the boil?

170
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:11,870
在...在下面
It's... It's down there.

171
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:12,670
下面哪里
Down where?

172
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:15,680
肖恩  在她阴唇上
Shaun. It's, um, on her labia.

173
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,100
疼吗
Is it painful?

174
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,270
就像把保龄球当棉条塞进去一样疼
Like I used a bowling ball for a tampon.

175
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,920
好吧  疔不应该那么疼的
Okay. Boils shouldn't hurt that much.

176
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,230
我能看看吗
Okay if we take a look?

177
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:26,710
好
Okay.

178
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,610
往下挪一点
If you just scoot down,

179
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,470
把脚放在蹬子上
put your feet in the stirrups...

180
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:34,580
很好
Great.

181
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,970
局部肿胀
The swelling is fairly localized.

182
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:41,910
与表观伤害不符的剧烈痛感
Extreme pain that's out of proportion to the visible injury

183
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:44,430
你可能感染了坏死性噬肉菌
could mean you have necrotizing flesh-eating bacteria.

184
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,190
什么
What?!

185
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,490
我会在手术前使用肝素
I'm gonna use the heparin pre-operatively

186
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:51,970
以及经食管超声心动图监测器
and a T.E.E. monitor.

187
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,000
还不够
Still not enough.

188
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,320
已经详细解释了心脏病发作或中风的风险
The risk of a heart attack or stroke was thoroughly explained.

189
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,940
患者仍坚持手术
The patient still wants the surgery.

190
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,330
是她想做  还是你想做
She wants it? Or you want it?

191
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:03,480
确实
Yes,

192
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,100
挽救胚胎性命可以给我加分
saving a fetus' life would be good news for me.

193
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,210
还有其他问题吗
Any other questions?

194
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,150
或者辱骂
Or insults?

195
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,690
放松  我不是侮辱你
Relax. I'm not insulting you.

196
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,500
你当然想做这个手术
Of course you want to do the surgery.

197
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,240
但如果你做这样的手术
But you do surgeries like this,

198
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,780
患者可能会因此死去
some patients are going to die.

199
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,920
我们部门的手术成功率会降低
And then our department's success rate goes down,

200
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,750
经费随之减少
and then our funding goes down,

201
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,200
你就做不了类似手术了
and then you can't do surgeries like this.

202
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,890
所以如果有什么影响了你的判断...
So if your judgment is clouded in any way, just --

203
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:27,820
没有
It's not.

204
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:30,900
好吧
Okay.

205
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,120
抱歉  我知道这很疼
I'm sorry. I know this hurts,

206
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,650
但我得插入窥器  才能给你做检查
but I really do need to insert a speculum for this part of the exam.

207
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,380
如果真的如他所说
If I really have what he says,

208
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,720
你是不是得切掉我的...
does that mean you have to cut off my --

209
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,820
不  我之前说了
No. No, as I said,

210
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:54,060
脓肿很可能是由未经治疗的衣原体感染所引起的
the abscess is most likely the result of an untreated chlamydia infection.

211
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,570
阴部神经

212
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,530
我们会把脓液排出来
We'll drain the abscess,

213
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:56,570
阴唇后神经

214
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:56,940
并给你抗生素治疗
give you antibiotics.

215
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,010
你会没事的
You'll be fine.

216
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,650
抱歉
I'm -- I'm sorry.

217
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,850
巴氏腺囊肿导致坐骨海绵体肌痉挛
The inflamed Bartholin gland is causing the ischiocavernosus muscle

218
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,830
并挤压阴唇神经
to spasm and pinch the labial nerve.

219
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,730
你需要抬高插入的角度
You need to start with a more upward angle.

220
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:10,750
我能试试吗
Can I try?

221
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,850
还是我来比较好
I think it's better if I do this.

222
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:20,280
好吧  好吧  你来
Yeah, okay. Fine.

223
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,070
我们可以联系你父母吗  告诉他们...
Can we, uh, call your parents? Let them know --

224
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:29,810
不
No.

225
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,680
我18岁了  已经成年了
I'm 18. I'm an adult.

226
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,700
成年人也需要精神支持
Even adults need emotional support.

227
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,830
需要有人在手术后送你回家
Someone to drive them home after surgery.

228
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:38,380
我打车回去
Uh, I'm gonna take a taxi.

229
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,290
我带钱了
I have money.

230
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,140
没什么可不好意思的
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.

231
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:45,300
四分之一的大学生在毕业前感染过性病
25% of college students contract an STD before graduation.

232
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:47,470
我没有不好意思
I'm not embarrassed.

233
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:49,220
我也对性病非常了解
And I know all about STDs.

234
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,220
我每个月都会做检查
I get tested every 30 days.

235
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:55,640
阴道壁及宫颈无坏死
There's no necrosis on the vaginal wall or cervix.

236
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,300
你已经插进去了
You got it in already?

237
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,690
是的  肯定不是噬肉菌感染
Yes. It's definitely not flesh-eating bacteria.

238
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:02,270
-我弄错了  -太好了
- I was wrong. - Thank God.

239
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:05,250
你仍需要手术排净巴氏腺脓肿
You do need surgery to drain the Bartholin gland abscess.

240
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,750
你为什么每个月都做性病检测
Why do you get an STD test every 30 days?

241
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:10,470
我必须得做  工作原因
I have to. For work.

242
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:13,590
我拍色情片
I do porn.

243
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:18,170
脐带长48厘米
The umbilical is 19 inches,

244
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:21,480
因此我们可以剖腹产取出胚胎
which will allow us to remove the fetus via Caesarean

245
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,430
并让其在我切除肿瘤时躺在母亲腿上
and rest it in its mother's lap while I excise the tumor.

246
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:26,170
但难的是
Now, the hard part

247
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,770
要在切除肿瘤后把胚胎重新放回母体
will be reinserting the fetus afterwards.

248
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:31,910
我们不能过度牵拉子宫壁
We can't overstretch the uterine wall,

249
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:34,900
并且我们得确保每一针都严丝密合
and we must be certain that every suture is tight enough

250
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:39,160
保证子宫能挺过未来四个多月胚胎的拳打脚踢
to handle four more months of kicks and thrown elbows.

251
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:41,400
有空谈谈吗
Do you have a minute?

252
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,340
可以等等吗
Can it wait?

253
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:44,160
不能
No.

254
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,280
我不想做手术
I don't want to do it.

255
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,630
你跟妻子谈过了吗
Have you talked to your wife?

256
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:02,270
说了  但她现在不理智
Yes, but she's not thinking rationally.

257
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,820
你也听到了  她宁死也不愿失去孩子
You heard her say she'd rather die than lose this baby.

258
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,110
抱歉  但是丈夫无权干涉
I'm sorry, but husbands don't have veto power

259
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:08,870
妻子的医疗决策
over their wife's medical decisions.

260
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,780
丈夫无权让你停止他妻子的手术
A husband can't stop you from operating on his wife.

261
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:16,750
但是父亲有权让你停止他孩子的手术
But a father can stop you from operating on his child.

262
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:31,250
什么类型的色情片啊
What kind of porn?

263
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,210
对不起
I'm sorry.

264
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:37,390
我一直忙于做检查  看她是否需要手术
I was too busy doing all the labs and imaging she needed for surgery.

265
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,310
忘记问她要简历了
I forgot to ask for her résumé.

266
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:41,080
我是说  她是真正的演员吗
I just mean, is she an actual actress,

267
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,640
就是剧情相关的人  还是...
like in stuff with a story, or...

268
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,720
现在色情片还有剧情吗
Do they even make porn with stories anymore?

269
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,840
有时候有
Sometimes.

270
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:48,380
你看毛片
You watch porn?

271
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,690
他为什么不能看
Why wouldn't he?

272
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:51,900
我不知道  他看起来...
I don't know. He just seems...

273
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,450
他是个男人  所有男人都看毛片
He's a guy. All guys watch porn.

274
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,760
你检查完安德鲁斯的患者了吗
You finished with Andrews' patient?

275
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,260
没有  那不是疖
No. It wasn't a boil.

276
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:00,730
是巨大的巴氏腺囊肿压迫了她的阴部神经
It's a large Bartholin gland abscess that's pressing on her pudendal nerve.

277
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:02,830
显然这引起了外科主任的兴趣
Which apparently does interest a chief surgeon.

278
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:05,250
我们明早会协助安德鲁斯进行手术
We're gonna assist Andrews when he drains it first thing in the morning.

279
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,330
想着和你确认一下
We just thought we'd check with you.

280
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,140
回家睡觉吧
Go home. And sleep.

281
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,710
别玩游戏  或者其他提神的事
Not play video games or whatever it is keeping you up.

282
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,080
我不觉得这是打游戏
I don't think it's video games.

283
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,640
你也回去吧  忙了一天了
You can head out, too. It's been a long day.

284
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,850
-那个... -胚胎手术暂缓
- But what about... - Fetal surgery's been put on hold.

285
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:18,680
什么  为什么
What? Why?

286
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,590
回家吧
Go home.

287
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:27,460
胚胎一旦从子宫中拿出
Once the fetus is removed from the uterus,

288
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,210
就可被称为「孩子」了
one could argue that it becomes a child.

289
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:30,350
太荒谬了
That's ridiculous.

290
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,430
有很多法律先例...
There are numerous legal precedents...

291
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:34,500
这保证保障了母亲的选择权
That guarantee the mother's right to choose.

292
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,210
她的身体她做主
It's her body. It's her control.

293
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:38,390
我同意继续做手术
I'm completely comfortable going ahead with this surgery.

294
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:38,940
我也是
As am I.

295
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,710
我之前反对  现在也坚决不同意
I never was, and I certainly am not now.

296
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:42,910
抱歉  在我们确认父母意见
I'm sorry. Until we're certain there is no liability

297
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:45,030
与责任无关之前  我也不同意
connected to parental consent, neither am I.

298
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,320
看来我们取得一致意见的是
Well, the one thing I think we can all agree on

299
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,260
这位母亲无权做任何事
is that the mother has the power to do nothing.

300
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,250
如果她不终止妊娠
And if she doesn't terminate

301
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,290
或者做肿瘤摘除手术
or have the surgery to remove the tumor...

302
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:57,650
长着巨大肿瘤的胚胎就会死于
A fetus with a massive tumor will die...

303
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:59,440
有抗磷脂综合征的患者腹中
inside a patient with APS.

304
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,040
这位母亲也会死的  对吧
Then the mother would die, too, right?

305
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,660
如果我们什么都不做  他们都会死
So we do nothing, and they both die.

306
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:08,670
或者我们做一些既合法又道德完备的事
Or we can do something that's legally and ethically complicated,

307
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,280
也许他们都能活
and maybe they both live.

308
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,290
董事会已批准手术
The board has approved the surgery.

309
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,510
谢谢
Thank you.

310
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,300
-芭芭拉... -马克  别说了
- Barb, please... - Mark, stop.

311
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,700
-如果你爱我  -不
- If you loved me... - No.

312
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,110
-不  别这么说  -不  真的
- No, do not say that. - No, it's true.

313
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,270
如果你真的爱我
If you really loved me...

314
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:44,300
正因为我爱你  我才想保护你
I'm trying to protect you because I love you.

315
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:47,270
我不需要你的保护
I don't need your protection.

316
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,620
我需要你支持我
I need your support.

317
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:55,100
明早我们会为你准备手术
We'll start prepping you first thing in the morning.

318
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,010
试着睡会儿吧
Try and get some sleep.

319
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:58,400
谢谢
Thank you.

320
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,690
我还是不能相信
I still can't believe it.

321
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:18,620
那个18岁的大学生拍毛片
That 18-year-old college students do porn?

322
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,460
她不是那种人
She's just not the type.

323
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,560
你怎么知道她是哪种人  你刚认识她
How do you know what "type" she is? You just met her.

324
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,330
做了个病史和盆腔检查而已
Did one medical history and pelvic exam.

325
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:29,030
怎么了
What?

326
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:31,600
没什么
Nothing.

327
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,790
别  说啊
No, go ahead.

328
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:34,980
告诉我为什么错了
Tell me all the reasons why I'm wrong.

329
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:42,590
我高中时  在出走青少年庇护所当过志愿者
I volunteered at a shelter for runaway teens when I was at high school.

330
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,870
认识了很多性工作者
Got to know a lot of sex workers.

331
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:52,520
他们各不相同  但都有一样的...
They're not all the same, but they do have the same...

332
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:53,980
「盔甲」
armor.

333
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,360
我不信
I don't believe it.

334
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,830
-你觉得我在说谎  -不是
- You think I'm lying? - No.

335
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:02,090
不  我觉得你对我敞开心扉了
No, I think you just opened up to me,

336
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:04,060
开始分享一些私事
actually shared something personal.

337
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:07,590
高中的社会服务而已  没什么大不了的
It was high-school community service. It's not a big deal.

338
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:10,200
不  这很重要  非常重要
Oh, no, it's a big deal. This is huge.

339
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:12,640
-就像我在剥洋葱  -闭嘴
- I am peeling the onion. - Shut up.

340
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,440
其实更像是用大钝砍刀砍椰子  但...
Actually, it's more like hacking through a coconut with a dull machete, but...

341
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:17,790
「钝」就对了  非常钝
"Dull" is right. Very dull.

342
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,900
感觉不错  不是吗
It feels good, doesn't it?

343
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,470
你应该经常这样
You should do it more often.

344
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:28,370
你还是别担心我不会做的事情
How about you stop worrying about what I won't do

345
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,240
转而享受一下我将要做的事情吧
and just enjoy what I will?

346
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,910
你觉得她心智健全吗
Do you think she's of sound mind?

347
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,480
你现在真的想谈工作吗
You really want to talk about work right now?

348
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,690
她基本上威胁要自杀了
She's basically threatening to commit suicide.

349
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:50,710
她没要自杀
She's not suicidal.

350
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:53,520
她只是非常想要个孩子
She's... She's just desperate to have a child.

351
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,020
这也许是她最后的机会
This is probably her last chance.

352
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,330
她可以领养啊
She could adopt.

353
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,820
-那不一样  -是吗
- It's not the same. - Really?

354
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,240
你觉得那没区别吗
You don't think there's a difference?

355
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,220
对  没有
No, I don't.

356
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:05,460
亲自怀胎九月
Carrying a fetus in your body for nine months.

357
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:08,170
你觉得那不会建立起特殊的关系吗
You don't think that creates a unique relationship?

358
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:10,570
我觉得每段关系都有其独特之处
I think every relationship is unique.

359
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,000
对  当然
Yeah, of course.

360
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:13,710
你想说什么
What are you saying?

361
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:15,530
我只是觉得这很自私
I just think it's selfish.

362
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,670
我是说  她要经历很多
I mean, for her to go through so much,

363
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,870
也强迫她丈夫克服这些
to put your husband through so much,

364
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,680
只是为了这一段经历
just so you can have a certain experience

365
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,450
更何况还有其他方法
when there are other ways.

366
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,920
确实
Yeah, okay.

367
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,680
但你想要孩子的  对吧
But...you want children, though, right?

368
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,310
我们谈过这个
We've talked about this before.

369
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:32,430
没错  我想要孩子
Yes, I-I want children.

370
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,660
并且是我们的孩子
But our children.

371
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:35,460
你怀胎十月生的孩子
Like, from you getting pregnant.

372
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:36,470
是的
Yes.

373
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:40,490
但如果这样行不通呢
But what if that doesn't happen?

374
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:43,070
万一我怀不上孩子
What if I couldn't get pregnant

375
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:46,300
或者决定不想自己生
or if I decided that I didn't want to?

376
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,210
而想去领养一个
That I wanted to adopt instead?

377
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,890
你有什么事瞒着我吗
Is there something you're not telling me?

378
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,300
确实有
Actually, there is.

379
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,070
当我们一起开会时
When we're in meetings together,

380
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:57,230
别再说我的想法很荒谬
don't ever call my ideas "ridiculous."

381
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:58,960
别这样  我认真的
Come on, I'm being serious.

382
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,880
我也是
So am I.

383
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:04,720
你说得对  我很抱歉
You're right. I'm sorry.

384
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,140
不会再这样了
It won't happen again.

385
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,470
天啊  你吓到我了
Geez, you scared me.

386
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:31,970
-你在看什么  -没什么
- What're you reading? - Nothing.

387
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,930
-我能看吗  -不能
- Can I read it? - No.

388
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:35,440
-为什么  -因为
- Why? - Because.

389
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,570
为什么
Why?

390
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:37,910
因为
Because.

391
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:39,620
为什么
Why?

392
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,620
因为没有文字
Because there's nothing to read.

393
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:46,370
只是图片
Just pictures.

394
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:48,070
你从哪儿弄来的
Where'd you get this?

395
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:49,420
科琳·迈尔斯
Colleen Myers.

396
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:50,860
她爸的柜子里有好多
Her dad has so many in his closet,

397
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:53,210
她拿出几本来她爸都不知道
he doesn't even notice when she takes a few.

398
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:54,920
她真漂亮
She's pretty.

399
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:56,830
确实很漂亮
She sure is.

400
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:00,940
该睡觉了  熄灯
It's bedtime. That means lights out.

401
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,710
我坐过站了
I missed my stop.

402
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:21,870
我坐过站了
I missed my stop!

403
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:23,210
林伍德广场
Lynwood Place!

404
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:25,900
我要在林伍德广场下车
I need to get off at Lynwood Place.

405
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,300
我在林伍德广场停的时候
Well, then you should've been paying attention

406
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,220
你就应该注意
when I stopped at Lynwood Place.

407
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,170
下一站就更远了
Next stop's gonna be even further away,

408
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:33,310
我要是你...
so if I were you...

409
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:22,810
肖恩
Shaun?

410
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,520
你没事吧
Are you okay?

411
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:26,400
没事
Yes.

412
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,450
你在等人吗
Are you waiting for someone?

413
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:29,900
没有
No.

414
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:36,220
我的方向感也非常差
I'm horrible at directions, too.

415
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,300
每次我从地铁站出来
Every time I exit a BART station,

416
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,880
走过三条街之后才能意识到
I walk like three blocks before I realize

417
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,840
我走错方向了
I'm going the wrong direction.

418
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,970
你运气很好  我去健身房了
You're lucky I actually made it to the gym.

419
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,800
我喜欢在人少的时候去
I like to go when it's not crowded,

420
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,060
但工作之后就没动力去运动了
but it's so hard to motivate after work.

421
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,120
一半时间我都没...
Half the time I end up not...

422
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,180
你有臭味
You stink.

423
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:57,260
我知道  我身上有味道
I know. I'm disgusting.

424
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,340
但我不想在那里洗澡
But I can't shower there.

425
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,640
我怕被传染脚气
I'm terrified of foot fungus.

426
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:04,410
既然我们开始真心话攻击
Hey, you know, as long as we're tossing out truth grenades,

427
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:06,160
我得说当你的邻居真不爽
you suck at being a neighbor.

428
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,360
首先  你把电池要回去了
First, you take back your batteries,

429
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:10,340
你还会在半夜把我吵醒
and then you wake me up in the middle of the night

430
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,850
不停跺脚还敲着管子
stomping around and banging on pipes.

431
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:13,960
那到底是怎么回事
What the hell's up with that?

432
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:15,310
我的水槽漏水
My sink drips.

433
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:17,800
我睡不着  所以想修好它
I couldn't sleep, so I tried to fix it.

434
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,090
但我找不到我的螺丝刀  我很焦虑
Then I couldn't find my screwdriver, which made me anxious.

435
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:24,050
你不让我睡觉就因为你找不到螺丝刀
You kept me up because you were anxious about a screwdriver?

436
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,950
是的  我非常焦虑
Yes. I was very anxious.

437
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,170
你太逗了
You're funny.

438
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:32,640
我很臭  你很焦虑
I stink. You're anxious.

439
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,370
你总是怎么想就怎么说
You always say exactly what's on your mind.

440
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:38,420
和大多数人完全相反
It's the total opposite of most guys.

441
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:40,980
这很好
It's nice.

442
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:51,850
晚安
Good night.

443
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,430
今晚别再修水龙头了
And don't go fixing any faucets tonight.

444
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:56,640
那是工人的工作
That's Armen's job.

445
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:19,160
这是我公寓需要修理的物品清单
This is a list of repairs I need for my apartment.

446
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,100
33号公寓
Number 33.

447
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,950
你有什么毛病
What the hell is your problem?

448
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,020
抱歉  你好
Sorry. Hello.

449
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,260
我叫肖恩·莫菲  很高兴见到你
My name is Shaun Murphy. It's very nice to meet you.

450
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:31,980
在半夜12:40见到你我一点都不高兴
No, it's not nice to meet me at 12:40 a.m.

451
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:32,850
是的
Yes.

452
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:37,280
格拉斯曼医生说我需要修东西的话可以随时找你
Dr. Glassman said I can call you any time I need something fixed.

453
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,690
格拉斯曼医生是谁
Who the hell is Dr. Glassman?

454
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:41,810
他是圣何塞圣文德医院的院长
He's the president at San Jose St. Bonaventure Hospital.

455
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:43,300
我是那里的外科住院医师
I'm a surgical resident there.

456
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,840
我不管你是圣文德本人还是谁
Well, I don't care if you're St. Bonaventure himself.

457
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:48,280
除非有火灾或洪水
Unless it's a fire or flood,

458
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,100
不然我只在九点到五点间工作
I only work 9:00 to 5:00.

459
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:51,460
我...
I'll...

460
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:53,950
明天再在你工作时间过来
try and come back tomorrow between those times.

461
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:57,790
你都把我吵醒了  就把单子给我吧
You already woke me up. Just give me the damn list.

462
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:02,560
是我的错
It's my fault.

463
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:06,490
我应该想到你会按字面意思理解我的话
I should've known you would take what I said literally.

464
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,390
没事
It's okay.

465
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,240
你知道吗  肖恩
Actually, you know what, Shaun?

466
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,310
这不是我的错
It's not my fault.

467
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,890
这是你的问题  你很聪明
It's your responsibility. You're smart.

468
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:16,170
你应该运用自己的常识
You should be able to use your common sense.

469
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,520
去理解别人的话
When somebody says something,

470
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,780
你应该弄清楚他们真正的意思
you should figure out what they really mean.

471
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:24,090
当事情进展和你预想的不同时
And when things don't go exactly how you expected them,

472
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:25,320
换个角度
navigate that.

473
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:33,880
有一种职业叫私人护理
There's a thing called a Personal Support Worker.

474
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,130
可以想成家庭健康护理
Think of it like a home health aide.

475
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:37,190
我不需要  谢谢
No, thank you.

476
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:38,710
我能照顾好自己
I can take care of myself.

477
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:40,680
每个人都或多或少需要帮助
Everybody needs a little help now and then.

478
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,280
我在考虑让他们给我派一个
I-I'm thinking of asking them to give me one.

479
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:45,220
我自己生活很久了
I've lived by myself a long time.

480
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,970
在怀俄明州的卡斯珀
In Casper, Wyoming.

481
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,240
在卡斯珀大家会照顾你
Everybody looked out for you in Casper.

482
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,920
在卡斯珀大家都会互相留意
Everybody looks out for everybody in Casper.

483
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,600
这里是圣何塞  大城市
This is San Jose. It's a big city.

484
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,670
对住所的要求可比医疗需求大得多
And residency is a whole lot more demanding than medical --

485
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:56,800
我不需要助手
I don't need an aide.

486
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,820
我们只是聊聊  肖恩
We're just talking, Shaun.

487
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:59,850
-我不需要助手  -好吧
- I don't need an aide! - Okay, okay.

488
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:02,630
-好的  -好吧
- Okay. - Okay.

489
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:03,480
好的
Okay.

490
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,570
改天再说吧
We'll table it for some other time.

491
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:12,420
好好吃早餐  好吗
Let's enjoy our breakfast, okay?

492
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:21,470
艾伦先生
Mr. Allen?

493
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:25,100
我想劝她救救自己
I'm trying to convince her to save herself.

494
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,100
我不想拿妻子的命冒险
I don't want to roll the dice with my wife's life.

495
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,240
但她愿意
But she does.

496
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,270
我们要开始帮她做准备了
We're gonna start prepping her now,

497
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,250
几小时后她就要进手术室
and she goes into the O.R. in a few hours.

498
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,000
我明白她为何如此迫切
I understand why she's desperate.

499
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,040
但不明白你为何如此
But not why you are.

500
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:39,450
如果她死了  责任在你
If she dies, it's your fault.

501
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,660
如果她活下来呢
And what if she lives?

502
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:45,860
你就拥有了需要你的妻子和孩子
You're gonna have a wife and child who need you,

503
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,750
而你却一直想把她赶出你的生活
and you keep driving her out of your life.

504
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,170
我不是迫切
I'm not desperate.

505
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:51,930
我很有信心
I'm confident.

506
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:54,360
你应该感到好受点
Which should make you feel better.

507
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:05,830
拉钩
Retraction.

508
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:07,860
我来切口
I'll make the incision,

509
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:10,430
然后由你插入导管
and then I want you to insert the Word catheter.

510
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:13,290
盆腔检查做的很棒  莫菲医生
Good job on the pelvic exam, Dr. Murphy.

511
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:15,030
患者还有肿胀  肯定不简单
With all this swelling, it couldn't have been easy.

512
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:15,850
谢谢
Thank you.

513
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:17,160
你怎么知道是谁
How do you know who...

514
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:18,840
我自有渠道
Oh, I have my ways.

515
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:20,060
就像圣诞老人
Like Santa.

516
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,160
我告诉的他
I told him.

517
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:22,560
没有礼物给你
No presents for you.

518
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:23,840
插入导管
Insert the drain.

519
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:27,740
但我很好奇
But I'm curious.

520
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:30,800
一个甚至都不能跟同事握手的人
How could a guy who can't even shake a co-worker's hand

521
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,570
是怎么克服障碍做盆腔检查的
be comfortable doing a pelvic exam?

522
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:35,870
握手是因为太用力  会疼
People squeeze too hard. It hurts.

523
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:37,950
送到实验室培养
Send this to the lab for culture.

524
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:42,420
那我猜你也不太喜欢拥抱吧
So, I'm guessing you're not that into hugs.

525
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,690
我不喜欢受到压迫
I don't like to be squeezed.

526
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:46,630
那如果是你喜欢的人呢
Well, what if it's somebody you like?

527
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:48,180
你爱的人呢
Or somebody you love?

528
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:49,570
你谈过女朋友吗
Have you ever had a girlfriend?

529
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:54,640
曾经  差点吻一个女孩
I almost kissed a girl. Once.

530
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,990
你知道俗话说得好
Well, you know what they say --

531
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:57,410
如果第一次不成功
If at first you don't succeed...

532
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,960
你是想嘲弄我还是鼓励我
Are you trying to mock me or encourage me?

533
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:02,710
我在尝试着了解你
I'm trying to get to know you

534
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:06,100
以便了解嘲弄你和鼓励你的时机
so I know when I should mock and when I should encourage.

535
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,310
何时是嘲弄你的时机
When's the right time to mock you?

536
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:17,080
再用力点按压脓肿
Press harder on that abscess.

537
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,230
现在脓液应该排净了
It should have drained by now.

538
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:19,500
不太对劲
Something's wrong.

539
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:23,060
脓已经排出  但肿胀并未消除
The gland's evacuated, but the swelling's not going down.

540
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,540
心率和血压正常
Heart rate and BP are stable.

541
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,160
能再亮点吗
Can I get a little more light, please?

542
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,980
-该死  -怎么了
- Damn. - What is it?

543
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:33,700
肿胀没有消除是因为脓肿下有肿瘤
The swelling isn't going down because there's a mass beneath the abscess.

544
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,940
不只是压迫着外阴神经
And it's not just pressing on the pudendal nerve --

545
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:37,490
已经完全包围了
It's totally engulfed it.

546
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:38,250
情况很糟
That's bad.

547
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:39,230
非常糟糕
Very bad.

548
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,010
已经做完了吗
You're done already?

549
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:55,250
我们已经设法排净脓肿
We were able to drain the abscess.

550
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,370
我已经觉得好多了
I already feel better.

551
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:59,100
这只是止痛药的效果
That's only because of the pain meds.

552
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,650
之所以痛感非常强烈
The reason the pain was so severe

553
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:02,310
是因为这并非只是脓肿
was because it wasn't just an abscess.

554
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,310
下面长了一个会阴肌瘤
There's perineal myoma underneath.

555
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:05,800
那是什么
What's that?

556
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,330
是一种纤维瘤
A fibroid tumor.

557
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:13,230
没有癌变  但是它包围了神经
It's not cancerous, but it is wrapped around the nerve.

558
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,840
我们得切除肿瘤
We need to remove the tumor,

559
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:18,510
但这样必须切除神经
but to do that, we will have to sever the nerve.

560
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:22,470
你的生殖器官会失去所有感觉
You'll lose all feeling in your genitals.

561
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:24,380
非常遗憾
I'm so sorry.

562
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:26,910
我就知道
I knew it.

563
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,180
是上帝在惩罚我
God's punishing me.

564
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,760
不  绝非如此
No, absolutely not.

565
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,860
这只是随机生长的...
This is just a random growth...

566
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,080
你信教吗
You're religious?

567
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,320
是的
Yes.

568
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,620
至少以前信
Or at least I used to be.

569
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,190
很久未感念过上帝了
I haven't thought about God in a really long time.

570
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,140
但生病住院后...
But being in here...

571
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:49,320
你确定不要我们帮你联络父母吗
You sure you don't want us to call your parents?

572
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,280
不  我没办法面对他们的脸
No. I couldn't bear to see the look on their faces.

573
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:55,930
尤其是爸爸
Especially my dad's.

574
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:58,600
父母就是如此  为你分忧
Well, that's what parents are for.

575
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:01,750
让你不必自己承担一切
So you don't have to do these things alone.

576
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:04,790
你能告诉你父亲你是个妓女吗
Could you tell your father you're a whore?

577
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:09,410
你是犯过错  但那都过去了
You made a mistake. That is all.

578
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,860
-患者生命体征  -稳定
- Patient vitals? - Stable.

579
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,260
-胚胎呢  -稳定
- Fetus? - Stable.

580
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:20,550
很好
Okay.

581
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,100
准备好了吗
Is everybody ready?

582
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,090
手术刀
Knife.

583
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,130
拉钩
Retractor.

584
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:53,290
好的
Okay.

585
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:55,710
切入子宫
Cutting into the uterus.

586
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:02,680
经食管超声心动图显示前壁机能减退
T.E.E. is showing anterior wall hypokinesis.

587
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,560
收缩压90  给我漂浮导管
Systolic pressure 90. Get me a Swan.

588
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,220
静脉注射功能降低  她心脏病突发了
I.V. function is decreasing. She's having a heart attack.

589
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,460
马上缝合切口
I need you to close the incision.

590
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:09,720
-马上  持针器  -快去拿荧光镜
- On it. Needle driver. - Get a fluoroscope in here!

591
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,320
我要对她进行球囊反搏
I'm gonna prep her for a balloon pump.

592
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:15,720
芭芭拉
Barbara?

593
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:19,450
手术时产生了并发症
There was a complication during surgery.

594
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:22,010
血块堵塞了你的心脏动脉
A blood clot blocked an artery in your heart.

595
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:23,790
我们及时处理了
We were able to catch it in time.

596
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,110
我的孩子呢
And my baby?

597
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,620
胚胎稳定
The fetus is stable.

598
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:30,250
我们打开子宫前  你心肌梗塞了
The M.I. happened before we opened the uterus.

599
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:32,950
这么说  我们又回到原点了吗
So, we're right back where we started?

600
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,480
你刚刚心脏病发作
You just had a heart attack.

601
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,480
我不在乎
I don't care.

602
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,140
现在没有选择了
There is no other option now.

603
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:40,700
如果不结束妊娠  胚胎会死在子宫内
If we don't terminate and the fetus dies in utero,

604
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:43,200
产生的血块会击垮你的心脏和大脑
the resulting clots will overwhelm your heart and brain.

605
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,380
所以我们更要再试一次
Which is exactly why we need to try again.

606
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,500
你在说什么
What're you talking about?

607
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,930
你得切除肿瘤
You need to remove the tumor.

608
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,940
你之前求我别做手术
You begged me not to do the surgery before.

609
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,870
之前我以为我能说服她
I thought I could talk her out of it then.

610
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:59,200
现在我知道我不能
Now I know I can't.

611
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:02,770
你要是不做  她就会死
Either you do it, or she dies.

612
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,710
此前  如果我们被起诉
Before, if we got sued,

613
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:09,440
他们至少有个人站在我们这边
we'd at least have one of them on our side,

614
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,470
但现在  他们达成一致了
but now, with them both aligned --

615
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:13,700
他们能起诉我们不动手术吗
Can they sue us for not operating?

616
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,980
他们可以争辩我们放弃治疗
They could argue that we abandoned care.

617
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,330
我们还在提供治疗
We're still offering care.

618
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:18,660
只不过不是他们想要的治疗
Just not the care that they want.

619
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:19,900
这都怪你
Which is your fault.

620
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:23,440
如果你一开始没给她希望
If you hadn't offered her hope to begin with,

621
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,980
也许我们还能说服她
we might have been able to reason with her.

622
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,070
切口周围有多疼痛
How's the pain around the incision?

623
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,640
满级十级的话  五级疼痛
5 out of 10.

624
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:29,870
我会加大剂量
I'll up the dosage.

625
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,260
心绞痛吗
Any chest pain?

626
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,730
没有  心脏感觉很好
No. My heart actually feels fine.

627
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:35,700
好的
Good.

628
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:43,810
如果她不想结束妊娠  我们也无能为力
If she doesn't want to terminate, there's nothing we can do.

629
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:45,100
我们就送她回家等死吗
So we just send her home to die?

630
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:46,170
那是她的决定
It is her decision.

631
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:48,690
我们可以告诉她我们进行胚胎手术
We could tell her we were going ahead with the fetal surgery.

632
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:49,700
但等她被麻醉...
But once she's under --

633
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,200
我就当作你没说过这句话
I'm gonna pretend you never said that.

634
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,800
如果那是救她的唯一机会
If it's the only chance to save her life --

635
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,290
这正是我想说的
This is exactly what I'm talking about.

636
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:57,630
你不会骗要自杀的人来阻止他跳楼吗
You wouldn't lie to convince a suicidal person to climb down off the ledge?

637
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:00,030
故意隐瞒患者一场重大外科手术
Knowingly lying to a patient about a major medical surgery --

638
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:01,070
好了  够了
Okay, okay! Hey!

639
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,560
欺骗患者是一回事
Lying to a patient is one thing.

640
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,530
未经他们同意而进行手术
Performing surgery without their consent --

641
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:07,070
是缺乏职业道德并且违法的
It's unethical and illegal.

642
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,210
还很疯狂
And insane.

643
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,430
我只是...
I just...

644
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,800
我不想这么做
I don't want to do this.

645
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:18,580
我们还有其他选择
It's not our only option.

646
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,980
你要我再尝试做胚胎手术吗
You want me to attempt the fetal surgery again?

647
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,500
如果只有这个办法能救她
If it's the only way to save her life.

648
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,560
第一次的话  只有这个办法能救她
The first time, it was the only way to save her life.

649
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,920
但经历了第一次后  第二天再心脏病发作
But a second heart attack one day after the first

650
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,780
-她会死  -也许不会
- will kill her. - Maybe not.

651
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:31,530
抱歉打扰了  但...
I am so sorry to interrupt, but I...

652
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:33,210
我有个主意
I have an idea.

653
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:36,940
如果我们在她自杀之前先杀死她呢
What if we kill her before she kills herself?

654
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,380
我们会停止你的心脏
We'll stop your heart

655
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:45,220
在手术期间使用分流机代替
and put you on a bypass machine for the duration of the surgery.

656
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:46,360
如果你的心脏没有跳动
You can't have a heart attack

657
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,040
你就不会心脏病发作
if your heart's not beating to begin with.

658
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,170
解决了这台手术最大的危险
It takes the most significant danger off the table.

659
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:52,410
但血块不是仍会危及她的大脑吗
But aren't the clots a danger to her brain, as well?

660
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:54,680
这不能完全排除所有风险
This doesn't completely eliminate every risk,

661
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,230
但能解决最大的风险
but it does reduce the biggest one.

662
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:00,230
谢谢
Thank you.

663
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,180
我们明天一早就动手术
We'll do it first thing in the morning.

664
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:35,570
你修了我的水槽
You fixed my sink!

665
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:37,630
你知道现在几点吗
Do you know how to tell time?

666
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:39,120
你修了我的水槽
You fixed my sink!

667
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,970
不用客气  走开吧
You're welcome. Now go away.

668
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:42,460
那不在清单上
It was not on the list!

669
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:45,280
水龙头  不在清单上
The faucet. It was not on the list.

670
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,750
你不该碰的
You weren't supposed to touch it.

671
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:51,130
我把你吵醒我要修的东西都修好后
So after I fix everything you woke me up for,

672
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:53,040
我不怕麻烦地去修别的
then I go out of my way to fix something el--

673
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,890
它不在清单上是因为我已经修好了
It was not on the list because I'd already fixed it.

674
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:57,760
好吧  你没修好
Well, you fixed it wrong.

675
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,170
因为它还在滴水
Because it was still dripping.

676
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:00,400
我需要它滴水
I need it to drip.

677
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:02,720
保持和我在卡斯珀的水槽一样的频率
At the same rate as my sink in Casper.

678
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,010
之前滴得太慢了
It was too slow before.

679
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:05,500
现在我得重新修了
Now I have to fix it all over again.

680
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,540
这不公平
It's not fair.

681
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:08,510
我受够了
I'm done.

682
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:10,340
如果你不喜欢你的水龙头
If you don't like your faucet

683
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:13,100
或公寓里其他的设施  就搬走
or anything else in your apartment? Move.

684
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:16,510
你再在傍晚五点之后敲这扇门
If you knock on this door again after 5:00 p.m.,

685
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:18,380
我就打得你满地找牙
I'm gonna knock your teeth out.

686
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:36,360
BGM: Down In The Valley by The Head And The Heart

687
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:41,610
? I wish I was a slave to an age-old trade ?

688
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:49,670
? Like ridin' around on railcars and workin' long days ?

689
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:56,970
? Lord, have mercy on my rough and rowdy ways ?

690
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:02,140
? Lord, have mercy on my rough and rowdy ways ?

691
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:05,260
? Call it one drink too many ?

692
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:08,610
? Call it pride of a man ?

693
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:13,620
? But it don't make no difference ?

694
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:16,130
? If you sit or you stand ?

695
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:23,780
? 'Cause they both end in trouble and start with a grin ?

696
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:30,820
? We do it over and over and over again ?

697
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:58,750
? I am on my way ?

698
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:00,900
? I am on my way ?

699
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:06,290
? I am on my way back to where I started ?

700
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:08,610
? California ?

701
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:10,840
? Oklahoma ?

702
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:15,140
? And all of the places I ain't ever been to ?

703
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:17,620
? Down in the valley ?

704
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:19,920
? With whiskey rivers ?

705
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:24,180
? These are the places you will find me hidin' ?

706
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:28,510
? These are the places I will always go ?

707
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:33,130
? Theses are the places I will always go ?

708
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:33,930
-神经就像管子  -肖恩  这...
- Nerves are like pipes! - Shaun, th-- this --

709
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:36,550
我们得切断阴部神经以切除肌瘤
We need to sever the pudendal nerve to excise the myoma,

710
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:37,960
但如果我们再接合末端...
but if we reconnect the ends...

711
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,070
肿瘤的直径是四公分
The tumor is 4 centimeters in diameter.

712
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:42,190
这个要再接合末端的裂口太宽了
That's way too wide of a gap to reconnect the ends,

713
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,390
而且神经不会伸展
and nerves don't stretch.

714
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,950
我们不需要伸展它
We don't need to stretch it.

715
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:47,510
我们可以把阴部神经的末端
We can connect the distal end of the pudendal nerve

716
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:50,310
接到她大腿内侧的股皮神经分支
to the branch of the femoral cutaneous nerve from her inner thigh.

717
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:56,600
你宁愿失去大腿还是外阴部的知觉
Would you rather lose feeling in your thigh or genitals?

718
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,550
当然是大腿
Thigh, definitely.

719
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:01,240
他说得对吗
Is he right?

720
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,580
我们能那么做吗
Can we do that?

721
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:06,060
先讨论一下再通知患者
It probably would've been better to discuss this prior

722
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,880
会更加妥当
to meeting with the patient,

723
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:10,150
但没错  我觉得可行
but, yes, I think it could work.

724
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,540
切断缝合
Cut the suture.

725
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,630
嫁接神经已准备好  看看是否可行
Grafted nerve's in place. Let's see if it will conduct.

726
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:37,620
传导电极已准备好
Conduction electrodes are in position.

727
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,760
发送脉冲
Send a pulse.

728
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:43,970
再来
Again.

729
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,100
再来
Again.

730
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,050
-再来  -好了  莫菲  我们知道了
- Again. - Okay, Murphy, we get it.

731
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:50,400
你的方法可行
Your idea worked.

732
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,780
你们俩都干得不错
Good job. Both of you.

733
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,270
-谢谢  -谢谢
- Thanks. - Thank you.

734
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:58,050
我猜梅伦德斯不常告诉你们
I'm guessing Melendez doesn't let you know this enough,

735
00:35:58,050 --> 00:36:00,140
但你们俩都很棒
but you both are doing a great job.

736
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:03,440
如果你们需要什么  就算只是想聊聊
And if either of you needs anything, even just to talk,

737
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,680
我的门永远为你们敞开
my door's always open.

738
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:07,670
给我4-0薇乔
4-0 Vicryl.

739
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:08,580
好的  医生
Yes doctor.

740
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:09,720
4-0薇乔
4-0 Vicryl.

741
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,770
她已做好体外循环
She's on bypass.

742
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:17,640
阻断主动脉
Cross clamping the aorta.

743
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,610
准备好了吗
You ready?

744
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:28,660
-冲洗心脏  -冲洗中
- Flush the heart. - Flushing.

745
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:38,730
准备剖腹产
Let's prep her for C-section.

746
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:49,630
安德鲁斯医生
Dr. Andrews.

747
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:52,710
手术非常成功
The operation went perfectly.

748
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,550
但我下面没有感觉
But I don't feel anything down there.

749
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:56,580
你还处于麻醉状态  还需要...
You're still on the meds, so it's gonna --

750
00:36:56,580 --> 00:37:00,330
知觉完全恢复需要半年至一年
It's going to take six months to a year to regain complete sensation.

751
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:03,910
你的大脑还需要时间搞清楚怎么回事
It'll take a while for your brain to figure out what we did.

752
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,110
但嫁接神经已经全部导通
But the grafted nerve is fully conducting.

753
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:07,440
你会好起来的
You're gonna be fine.

754
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:08,590
谢谢你
Thank you.

755
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:12,320
-能帮我个忙吗  -当然
- Can you do me a favor? - Sure.

756
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,150
-给我父母打电话  -好的
- Call my parents. - Absolutely.

757
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:26,820
-手术刀  -手术刀
- Knife. - Knife.

758
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:52,920
电刀
Bovie.

759
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:54,470
电刀
Bovie.

760
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,060
体外循环怎么样了
How're we on bypass?

761
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,860
-卡卢医生  你还在吗  -嗯
- Dr. Kalu, you still with us? - Yeah.

762
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,350
中心静脉压正常
Central venous pressure's good.

763
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:20,220
搭桥氧压200
Bypass oxygen tension's 200.

764
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:22,940
很好  修复胚胎骶骨
Good. Repairing the fetal sacrum.

765
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,100
要把胎儿放回母体了
Gonna put this baby back where it belongs.

766
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:26,680
「胎儿」
Baby?

767
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:30,220
你第一次没叫它「胚胎」
That's the first time you didn't call it a fetus.

768
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:32,860
只是个称呼
Just an expression.

769
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:45,990
我告诉过你
I told you.

770
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:47,980
是的  你说过了
Yes, you did.

771
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:51,300
你需要卧床休养四个月
You're gonna need to stay in bed for the next four months...

772
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:54,060
但你和你儿子的预诊都非常好
but both you and your son's prognosis is excellent.

773
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:58,600
我们想出生之后再确定性别的
We wanted it to be a surprise.

774
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:01,730
低级错误
Rookie mistake.

775
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:07,650
太好了
Yes!

776
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:10,720
我们今晚一定要庆祝
We are definitely celebrating tonight.

777
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,740
还睡什么觉  墨菲
Screw sleep, Murphy.

778
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:14,210
你得和我们一起去
You are coming with us.

779
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:15,260
你们要去哪儿
Where are you going?

780
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:17,620
-出去  我们要喝一杯  -我不渴
- Out. We're gonna drink. - I'm not thirsty.

781
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:18,580
别傻了
Don't be an idiot.

782
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:20,500
我的意思是...
I just meant...

783
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:22,410
来吧  兄弟
Come on, mate.

784
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,820
你刚拯救了一个18岁女孩的性生活
You just saved an 18-year-old girl's sex life.

785
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:26,710
而我救了两个人
And I saved two lives.

786
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:28,060
我们必须得喝
We are drinking.

787
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:31,930
来吧  肖恩
Come on, Shaun.

788
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:35,800
好吧
Okay.

789
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:37,540
太棒了
Cool.

790
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:48,490
BGM: There's Nothing Holdin' Me Back by Shawn Mendes

791
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:41,870
? Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back ?

792
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:49,750
? There's nothing holdin' me back ?

793
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:53,360
好了
All right.

794
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,010
我现在得回家了
I have to go home now.

795
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:57,470
? Just picture everybody naked ?

796
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,740
没事的  别担心
It'll be okay. Don't worry.

797
00:39:57,470 --> 00:40:00,090
? She really doesn't have to wait ?

798
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,040
我们不会待太久
We won't stay long.

799
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:04,420
? Not really into hesitation ?

800
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:10,180
? Pulls me in enough to keep me guessing ?

801
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,330
肖恩
Hi, Shaun.

802
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:29,220
科琳
Hi, Colleen.

803
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:32,920
听说史蒂夫给你看了我爸的杂志
I heard Steve showed you my dad's magazine.

804
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,780
你喜欢吗
Did you like it?

805
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:39,880
别紧张  我不会告诉别人的
Don't worry. I'm not gonna tell anyone.

806
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:44,280
这没什么可害羞的
It's nothing to be embarrassed about.

807
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:46,970
所有男人都喜欢那种东西
All guys like that kind of stuff.

808
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:50,920
你想知道我的一个秘密吗
You want to know a secret about me?

809
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:54,010
我觉得你很可爱
I think you're really cute.

810
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:57,380
你有泡泡糖的味道
You smell like bubble gum.

811
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:59,480
我知道  是我唇彩的味道
I know. It's my lip gloss.

812
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:03,180
跟我来
Come here.

813
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,960
跟我来  小傻瓜
Come here, silly.

814
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:11,630
你觉得我好看吗
Do you think I'm pretty?

815
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,320
我也喜欢你
I like you, too.

816
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:21,710
如果你给我看  我就给你看
I'll show you mine if you show me yours.

817
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:26,830
来啊  我很好奇
Come on. I'm curious.

818
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,440
你也好奇吧
You must be curious.

819
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,230
我能亲你吗
Can I have a kiss?

820
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,450
我想知道那是什么感觉
I want to know what it feels like.

821
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:37,940
我可以亲你
I'll give you a kiss...

822
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,020
如果你让我看
if you show me.

823
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:40,720
看什么
Show you what?

824
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:43,000
你知道啊  把裤子脱下来
You know. Pull down your pants.

825
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:43,940
不
No.

826
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,410
来啊  肖恩
Come on, Shaun.

827
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:47,920
不  我得走了
No. I gotta go.

828
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:52,220
天啊  不敢相信你差点脱裤子了
Oh, my God. I can't believe you were about to pull it out.

829
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:53,300
不  我没有
No, I wasn't!

830
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:56,010
我怎么可能亲一个你这样的怪胎
And like I'd ever kiss a creepy weirdo like you.

831
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:58,680
别烦他  我们走
Leave him alone! Come on.

832
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:03,840
? Baby, there's nothing holdin me back ?

833
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:06,740
大家举杯  敬我们自己
All right, guys, a toast. To us.

834
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:08,310
因为我们太帅了
'Cause we rock.

835
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,400
无需多言
Nothing else need be said.

836
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:12,030
-干杯  -干杯
