1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,012
<i>Previously on "The Good Doctor"...</i>

2
00:00:02,046 --> 00:00:05,398
I'm your neighbor. I'm in the middle
of "Uncharted," and I'm dead.

3
00:00:05,438 --> 00:00:06,811
Can I borrow some triple A's?

4
00:00:06,836 --> 00:00:08,036
It's kind of silly, isn't it?

5
00:00:08,038 --> 00:00:09,971
Our relationship...
that we're hiding it.

6
00:00:09,973 --> 00:00:12,140
We don't have a relationship.

7
00:00:12,142 --> 00:00:13,608
We have sex.

8
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:15,476
- You're late.
- No, the bus was late.

9
00:00:15,478 --> 00:00:16,844
I did nothing wrong. The bus...

10
00:00:16,846 --> 00:00:18,313
Yeah. This is gonna work out great.

11
00:00:18,315 --> 00:00:20,214
So you're treating him
like anybody else?

12
00:00:20,216 --> 00:00:21,516
You have any idea how many patients

13
00:00:21,518 --> 00:00:22,784
he's scared the crap out of today?

14
00:00:22,786 --> 00:00:23,885
So teach him.

15
00:00:23,887 --> 00:00:25,520
I'm teaching you both
that he doesn't belong.

16
00:00:25,522 --> 00:00:27,655
I hear you got Shaun off scut

17
00:00:27,657 --> 00:00:28,890
and back into surgery.

18
00:00:28,892 --> 00:00:30,525
You figure you'll give him
a little authority,

19
00:00:30,527 --> 00:00:31,893
he'll screw something up.

20
00:00:31,895 --> 00:00:33,328
Either way, if he succeeds,

21
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:34,629
I'm the guy who just backed him.

22
00:00:34,631 --> 00:00:37,765
And if he fails, I'm the president.

23
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:16,535
Hello. I've looked everywhere.

24
00:01:17,261 --> 00:01:19,340
All right, I'm here now. We'll...

25
00:01:21,011 --> 00:01:23,945
We'll just keep looking
until you find it.

26
00:01:23,947 --> 00:01:26,948
Why is the furniture
in the middle of the room?

27
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:28,016
I know I packed it.

28
00:01:28,018 --> 00:01:30,952
I made a list. "Star-tip screwdriver."

29
00:01:30,954 --> 00:01:33,287
Look, it's checked.

30
00:01:33,289 --> 00:01:34,756
It's checked.

31
00:01:45,135 --> 00:01:47,135
Maybe you... you threw it out
with the newspapers

32
00:01:47,137 --> 00:01:48,336
you used to pack the dishes?

33
00:01:48,338 --> 00:01:49,837
I packed with bubble wrap.

34
00:01:49,839 --> 00:01:51,782
It's safer. And you can see through it.

35
00:01:51,807 --> 00:01:52,827
Of course you did.

36
00:01:52,852 --> 00:01:55,510
Shaun, there's
a hardware store up the road.

37
00:01:55,512 --> 00:01:56,577
You can buy a new one.

38
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:58,146
I don't want a <i>new</i> screwdriver!

39
00:01:58,148 --> 00:01:59,447
I want <i>my</i> screwdriver!

40
00:01:59,449 --> 00:02:00,815
Stop it!

41
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,554
It's the middle of the... I'm sorry.

42
00:02:06,556 --> 00:02:09,157
I just shouldn't have yelled. J-Just...

43
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:11,559
Let's just take a moment.
Sit down, please.

44
00:02:13,996 --> 00:02:16,330
Uh, you know what?

45
00:02:16,332 --> 00:02:20,186
We can use this for now, okay?

46
00:02:22,972 --> 00:02:24,138
I can't stay here.

47
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,139
Of course you can.

48
00:02:25,141 --> 00:02:26,841
- It'll be fine.
- I can't stay here.

49
00:02:26,843 --> 00:02:29,010
The... dishwasher doesn't dry,

50
00:02:29,012 --> 00:02:30,978
the shower drain has
someone else's hair in it.

51
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:34,082
And the crisper drawer
keeps coming off the track?

52
00:02:34,084 --> 00:02:36,918
I assume that's what you were fixing.

53
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,620
I forgot.

54
00:02:39,622 --> 00:02:41,022
Of course you forgot.

55
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,090
It's understandable.

56
00:02:42,092 --> 00:02:44,158
You've been working your ass off.

57
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,828
You're exhausted.
You're under a lot of stress.

58
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,196
There's a super in the building.

59
00:02:48,198 --> 00:02:50,898
You can... call him anytime.

60
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,234
Just make a list of
the things you need repaired.

61
00:02:53,236 --> 00:02:54,769
Later, Shaun. Later.

62
00:02:54,771 --> 00:02:56,471
Later, Shaun!

63
00:02:57,026 --> 00:02:58,425
Go to bed now.

64
00:02:58,487 --> 00:03:00,441
Go to bed.

65
00:03:11,787 --> 00:03:14,388
36 years old, 22 weeks pregnant.

66
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:15,756
Ultrasound at 16 weeks

67
00:03:15,758 --> 00:03:17,592
revealed a tumor on the fetus' tailbone.

68
00:03:17,594 --> 00:03:19,327
Mom's got antiphospholipid syndrome.

69
00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:21,829
- Makes surgery high risk.
- Also makes pregnancy high risk.

70
00:03:21,831 --> 00:03:24,165
She's had three miscarriages.

71
00:03:24,167 --> 00:03:25,967
We need to do an ultrasound and MRI

72
00:03:25,992 --> 00:03:28,425
to measure the tumor's growth rate.

73
00:03:29,047 --> 00:03:31,772
Late bus doesn't explain
why you're showing up tired

74
00:03:31,774 --> 00:03:33,341
after you just had 12 hours off.

75
00:03:33,343 --> 00:03:35,076
We're all tired.

76
00:03:35,078 --> 00:03:36,844
Our last shift was 36 hours.

77
00:03:36,846 --> 00:03:39,247
I'm not interested in debating
the shift schedule with you.

78
00:03:39,249 --> 00:03:42,683
But I am curious why you always feel
the need to defend him.

79
00:03:42,685 --> 00:03:45,019
Well, we're all on the same team.

80
00:03:45,021 --> 00:03:46,087
Yes.

81
00:03:46,089 --> 00:03:48,222
But you're all quarterbacks.

82
00:03:48,224 --> 00:03:49,657
And when training camp is over,

83
00:03:49,659 --> 00:03:51,526
there's only gonna be one starter.

84
00:03:59,057 --> 00:04:00,650
The crown-rump length of the fetus

85
00:04:00,675 --> 00:04:02,889
is 21.5 centimeters.

86
00:04:04,305 --> 00:04:06,839
And the diameter of the tumor is...

87
00:04:10,155 --> 00:04:12,221
...10.6 centimeters.

88
00:04:12,348 --> 00:04:14,443
Half the size of the fetus.

89
00:04:14,784 --> 00:04:16,184
The tumor's grown.

90
00:04:16,404 --> 00:04:19,954
It's not cancer, but it is
monopolizing the blood supply,

91
00:04:19,956 --> 00:04:22,023
which is weakening the fetus' heart.

92
00:04:22,025 --> 00:04:24,959
I'm sorry, but there's
no chance it would survive

93
00:04:24,961 --> 00:04:26,894
long enough to be viable.

94
00:04:26,896 --> 00:04:29,430
The safest course
is to terminate the pregnancy.

95
00:04:33,135 --> 00:04:35,536
If we were interested
in the "safest course,"

96
00:04:35,538 --> 00:04:37,905
we wouldn't be
on our third "second opinion."

97
00:04:37,907 --> 00:04:39,307
Please, Dr. Melendez,

98
00:04:39,309 --> 00:04:41,175
we want whatever will save our baby.

99
00:04:41,177 --> 00:04:43,211
Dr. Wright told us
you've done fetal surgery

100
00:04:43,213 --> 00:04:44,979
to remove this type of tumor before.

101
00:04:44,981 --> 00:04:46,914
And without the tumor,
our baby would be healthy.

102
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,585
Your antiphospholipid syndrome

103
00:04:50,587 --> 00:04:53,154
makes a long surgery
extremely dangerous.

104
00:04:53,156 --> 00:04:54,689
There's a high chance for blood clots,

105
00:04:54,691 --> 00:04:56,591
which could have
fatal consequences for you.

106
00:04:56,593 --> 00:04:58,059
We're willing to take that risk.

107
00:04:58,061 --> 00:04:59,894
Saving the fetus doesn't do any good

108
00:04:59,896 --> 00:05:01,262
if the mother dies in the process.

109
00:05:01,264 --> 00:05:03,598
I've had three miscarriages.

110
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,067
If I have to go through that
again, I might as well be dead.

111
00:05:06,069 --> 00:05:07,835
- Barb.
- It's true.

112
00:05:07,837 --> 00:05:09,971
No, it's not.

113
00:05:09,973 --> 00:05:12,240
You're the strongest woman
I've ever met.

114
00:05:12,242 --> 00:05:13,441
We'll get through this.

115
00:05:13,443 --> 00:05:15,676
<i>We</i> will. And...
And then we'll try again.

116
00:05:15,678 --> 00:05:18,112
We could manage
clotting risk pre-operatively

117
00:05:18,114 --> 00:05:20,514
with an infusion
of unfractionated heparin.

118
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,957
Never contradict me
in front of a patient again.

119
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:31,425
I didn't.

120
00:05:31,427 --> 00:05:33,461
I agree with your assessment
of the risks.

121
00:05:33,463 --> 00:05:35,062
I suggested a way
we could mitigate them.

122
00:05:35,064 --> 00:05:36,530
Not in front of the patient.

123
00:05:36,532 --> 00:05:38,432
We're not in front of the patient now.

124
00:05:38,434 --> 00:05:42,136
I was just reading about a new technique

125
00:05:42,138 --> 00:05:45,072
for transesophageal
echocardiography monitoring.

126
00:05:45,074 --> 00:05:46,641
If there's a cardiac issue,

127
00:05:46,643 --> 00:05:48,376
it would give us an early warning.

128
00:05:52,382 --> 00:05:54,548
Let's get her prepped. ASAP.

129
00:05:58,633 --> 00:06:03,976
<font color="#0080ff">Synced & corrected by</font> kinglouisxx

130
00:06:09,585 --> 00:06:11,319
I want J.L. on anesthesia.

131
00:06:11,344 --> 00:06:13,194
And let the neo-natal nursing supervisor

132
00:06:13,219 --> 00:06:14,969
know that I want to do
a full run-through.

133
00:06:17,073 --> 00:06:18,739
Yes?

134
00:06:18,741 --> 00:06:21,309
Well, we're a little busy up here, too.

135
00:06:21,311 --> 00:06:24,029
All right. I'll send someone.

136
00:06:24,547 --> 00:06:26,380
Andrews is covering for Lim in the ER.

137
00:06:26,382 --> 00:06:27,915
He has a patient
who needs a boil lanced.

138
00:06:27,917 --> 00:06:30,117
A plastic surgeon can't lance a boil?

139
00:06:30,119 --> 00:06:32,353
Plastic surgeons can.
Chief surgeons don't.

140
00:06:32,355 --> 00:06:34,021
You and Murphy.

141
00:06:34,023 --> 00:06:35,733
What?

142
00:06:35,842 --> 00:06:38,626
It was our ideas that convinced you
to do the fetal surgery,

143
00:06:38,628 --> 00:06:41,495
and now you're punishing us
with Andrews' scut work?

144
00:06:41,497 --> 00:06:43,230
<i>You're not getting punished.</i>

145
00:06:43,232 --> 00:06:44,231
<i>He</i> is.

146
00:06:44,233 --> 00:06:46,167
For being late. Again.

147
00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:48,235
But I don't trust him alone
with a patient.

148
00:06:48,237 --> 00:06:49,670
And since you like to defend him

149
00:06:49,672 --> 00:06:52,740
and seem to know how
to communicate with him...

150
00:06:52,742 --> 00:06:53,941
Hurry back.

151
00:06:59,256 --> 00:07:01,148
Olivia Hartman?

152
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:04,118
Yes, ma'am. I mean Doctor.

153
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,020
You're 18?

154
00:07:06,022 --> 00:07:08,022
- Yes, ma'am.
- Where's the boil?

155
00:07:08,024 --> 00:07:10,858
It's, um... It's down there.

156
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,126
Down where?

157
00:07:12,128 --> 00:07:15,129
Shaun. It's, um, on her labia.

158
00:07:15,131 --> 00:07:17,498
Hmm. Is it painful?

159
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,600
Like I used a bowling ball for a tampon.

160
00:07:19,602 --> 00:07:22,269
Okay. Boils shouldn't hurt that much.

161
00:07:22,271 --> 00:07:23,971
Okay if we take a look?

162
00:07:25,174 --> 00:07:26,307
Okay.

163
00:07:26,309 --> 00:07:28,075
If you just scoot down,

164
00:07:28,077 --> 00:07:29,877
put your feet in the stirrups...

165
00:07:32,749 --> 00:07:34,281
Great.

166
00:07:35,951 --> 00:07:38,452
The swelling is fairly localized.

167
00:07:38,454 --> 00:07:41,222
Extreme pain that's out of
proportion to the visible injury

168
00:07:41,224 --> 00:07:43,591
could mean you have necrotizing
flesh-eating bacteria.

169
00:07:43,593 --> 00:07:44,625
What?!

170
00:07:46,796 --> 00:07:49,663
I'm gonna use the heparin
pre-operatively

171
00:07:49,665 --> 00:07:51,165
and a T.E.E. monitor.

172
00:07:51,167 --> 00:07:52,466
Still not enough.

173
00:07:52,468 --> 00:07:54,268
The risk of a heart attack or stroke...

174
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,536
Was thoroughly explained.

175
00:07:55,538 --> 00:07:57,204
The patient still wants the surgery.

176
00:07:57,206 --> 00:07:59,673
<i>She</i> wants it? Or <i>you</i> want it?

177
00:08:02,054 --> 00:08:06,613
Yes, saving a fetus' life
would be good news for me.

178
00:08:06,883 --> 00:08:09,147
Any other questions?

179
00:08:09,352 --> 00:08:10,985
Or insults?

180
00:08:10,987 --> 00:08:12,920
Relax. I'm not insulting you.

181
00:08:12,922 --> 00:08:15,014
Of course you want to do the surgery.

182
00:08:15,224 --> 00:08:16,490
But you do surgeries like this,

183
00:08:16,492 --> 00:08:18,092
some patients are going to die.

184
00:08:18,094 --> 00:08:20,194
And then our department's
success rate goes down,

185
00:08:20,196 --> 00:08:21,295
and then our funding goes down,

186
00:08:21,297 --> 00:08:23,464
and then you can't do
surgeries like this.

187
00:08:23,466 --> 00:08:26,000
So if your judgment
is clouded in any way, just...

188
00:08:26,002 --> 00:08:27,067
It's not.

189
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:30,337
Okay.

190
00:08:38,648 --> 00:08:40,448
I'm sorry. I know this hurts,

191
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:42,416
but I really do need
to insert a speculum

192
00:08:42,418 --> 00:08:44,051
for this part of the exam.

193
00:08:44,053 --> 00:08:45,686
If I really have what he says,

194
00:08:45,688 --> 00:08:47,087
does that mean you have to cut off my...

195
00:08:47,089 --> 00:08:49,990
No. No, as <i>I</i> said, the abscess

196
00:08:49,992 --> 00:08:51,358
is most likely the result

197
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,561
of an untreated chlamydia infection.

198
00:08:53,563 --> 00:08:54,762
We'll drain the abscess,

199
00:08:54,764 --> 00:08:56,030
give you antibiotics.

200
00:08:56,032 --> 00:08:58,232
You'll be fine.

201
00:08:58,234 --> 00:08:59,733
Ow!

202
00:08:59,735 --> 00:09:01,502
I'm... I'm sorry.

203
00:09:01,504 --> 00:09:03,237
The inflamed Bartholin gland

204
00:09:03,239 --> 00:09:05,239
is causing the ischiocavernosus muscle

205
00:09:05,241 --> 00:09:07,007
to spasm and pinch the labial nerve.

206
00:09:07,009 --> 00:09:08,976
You need to start
with a more upward angle.

207
00:09:08,978 --> 00:09:10,277
Can I try?

208
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:11,879
I think it's better if I do this.

209
00:09:13,882 --> 00:09:15,583
Ow!

210
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:19,890
Yeah, okay. Fine.

211
00:09:25,894 --> 00:09:28,496
Can we, uh, call your parents?
Let them know...

212
00:09:28,498 --> 00:09:29,930
No.

213
00:09:29,932 --> 00:09:32,166
I'm 18. I'm an adult.

214
00:09:32,168 --> 00:09:34,001
Even adults need emotional support.

215
00:09:34,003 --> 00:09:36,070
Someone to drive them home
after surgery.

216
00:09:36,072 --> 00:09:37,738
Uh, I'm gonna take a taxi.

217
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,139
I have money.

218
00:09:39,141 --> 00:09:40,708
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.

219
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:45,045
25% of college students contract
an STD before graduation.

220
00:09:45,047 --> 00:09:46,947
I'm not embarrassed.

221
00:09:46,949 --> 00:09:48,716
And I know all about STDs.

222
00:09:48,718 --> 00:09:50,818
I get tested every 30 days.

223
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:55,289
There's no necrosis
on the vaginal wall or cervix.

224
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:56,857
You got it in already?

225
00:09:56,859 --> 00:10:00,027
Yes. It's definitely not
flesh-eating bacteria.

226
00:10:00,029 --> 00:10:01,662
- I was wrong.
- Thank God.

227
00:10:01,664 --> 00:10:04,431
You do need surgery to drain
the Bartholin gland abscess.

228
00:10:04,433 --> 00:10:07,001
Why do you get an STD test
every 30 days?

229
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:09,833
I have to. For work.

230
00:10:11,606 --> 00:10:13,207
I do porn.

231
00:10:15,277 --> 00:10:17,613
The umbilical is 19 inches,

232
00:10:17,713 --> 00:10:20,781
which will allow us to remove
the fetus via Caesarean

233
00:10:20,806 --> 00:10:24,144
and rest it in its mother's lap
while I excise the tumor.

234
00:10:24,387 --> 00:10:25,886
Now, the hart part

235
00:10:25,888 --> 00:10:28,397
will be reinserting
the fetus afterwards.

236
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:31,382
We can't overstretch the uterine wall,

237
00:10:31,571 --> 00:10:34,405
and we must be certain that
every suture is tight enough

238
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:39,228
to handle four more months
of kicks and thrown elbows.

239
00:10:39,535 --> 00:10:40,568
Do you have a minute?

240
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,570
Can it wait?

241
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:43,737
No.

242
00:10:53,149 --> 00:10:55,015
I don't want to do it.

243
00:10:57,419 --> 00:10:58,852
Have you talked to your wife?

244
00:10:58,854 --> 00:11:01,755
Yes, but she's not thinking rationally.

245
00:11:01,757 --> 00:11:04,124
You heard her say she'd
rather die than lose this baby.

246
00:11:04,126 --> 00:11:06,393
I'm sorry, but husbands
don't have veto power

247
00:11:06,395 --> 00:11:07,995
over their wife's medical decisions.

248
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:13,033
A husband can't stop you
from operating on his wife.

249
00:11:13,035 --> 00:11:16,136
But a father can stop you
from operating on his child.

250
00:11:26,944 --> 00:11:29,649
What kind of porn?

251
00:11:30,392 --> 00:11:32,203
I'm sorry.

252
00:11:32,228 --> 00:11:34,495
I was too busy doing
all the labs and imaging

253
00:11:34,497 --> 00:11:35,529
she needed for surgery.

254
00:11:35,531 --> 00:11:37,297
I forgot to ask for her résumé.

255
00:11:37,299 --> 00:11:39,100
I just mean, is she an actual actress,

256
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:40,758
like in stuff with a story, or...

257
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,483
Do they even make porn
with stories anymore?

258
00:11:42,562 --> 00:11:45,061
Sometimes.

259
00:11:45,223 --> 00:11:47,423
You watch porn?

260
00:11:47,567 --> 00:11:49,100
Why wouldn't he?

261
00:11:49,102 --> 00:11:50,313
- I don't know. He just seems...
- He's a guy.

262
00:11:50,338 --> 00:11:52,138
All guys watch porn.

263
00:11:52,405 --> 00:11:53,871
You finished with Andrews' patient?

264
00:11:53,873 --> 00:11:55,206
No. It wasn't a boil.

265
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:57,074
It's a large Bartholin gland abscess

266
00:11:57,076 --> 00:11:58,476
that's pressing on her pudendal nerve.

267
00:11:58,478 --> 00:12:00,645
Which apparently
does interest a chief surgeon.

268
00:12:00,647 --> 00:12:02,246
We're gonna assist Andrews
when he drains it

269
00:12:02,248 --> 00:12:03,247
first thing in the morning.

270
00:12:03,249 --> 00:12:05,283
We just thought we'd check with you.

271
00:12:05,285 --> 00:12:07,184
Go home. And sleep.

272
00:12:07,186 --> 00:12:09,587
Not play video games or
whatever it is keeping you up.

273
00:12:09,589 --> 00:12:10,922
I don't think it's video games.

274
00:12:10,924 --> 00:12:12,657
You can head out, too.
It's been a long day.

275
00:12:12,659 --> 00:12:14,825
- But what about...
- Fetal surgery's been put on hold.

276
00:12:14,827 --> 00:12:16,594
What? Why?

277
00:12:16,596 --> 00:12:17,929
Go home.

278
00:12:23,102 --> 00:12:25,369
Once the fetus
is removed from the uterus,

279
00:12:25,371 --> 00:12:27,004
one could argue that it becomes a child.

280
00:12:27,006 --> 00:12:28,806
That's ridiculous.

281
00:12:28,808 --> 00:12:30,474
There are numerous legal precedents...

282
00:12:30,476 --> 00:12:32,376
That guarantee
the mother's right to choose.

283
00:12:32,378 --> 00:12:34,011
It's her body. It's her control.

284
00:12:34,013 --> 00:12:36,247
I'm completely comfortable
going ahead with this surgery.

285
00:12:36,249 --> 00:12:37,315
As am I.

286
00:12:37,317 --> 00:12:38,816
I never was, and I certainly am not now.

287
00:12:38,818 --> 00:12:40,851
I'm sorry. Until we're
certain there is no liability

288
00:12:40,853 --> 00:12:42,820
connected to parental consent,
neither am I.

289
00:12:43,568 --> 00:12:46,257
Well, the one thing
I think we can all agree on

290
00:12:46,259 --> 00:12:49,026
is that the mother
has the power to do nothing.

291
00:12:49,028 --> 00:12:51,095
And if she doesn't terminate

292
00:12:51,097 --> 00:12:53,230
or have the surgery
to remove the tumor...

293
00:12:53,232 --> 00:12:54,799
A fetus with a massive tumor

294
00:12:54,801 --> 00:12:57,301
will die inside a patient with APS.

295
00:12:57,303 --> 00:12:59,070
Then the mother would die, too, right?

296
00:12:59,072 --> 00:13:01,439
So we do nothing, and they both die.

297
00:13:01,441 --> 00:13:03,474
Or we can do something

298
00:13:03,476 --> 00:13:06,533
that's legally
and ethically complicated,

299
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:08,112
and maybe they both live.

300
00:13:22,828 --> 00:13:24,228
The board has approved the surgery.

301
00:13:25,609 --> 00:13:27,108
Thank you.

302
00:13:27,133 --> 00:13:29,892
- Barb, please...
- Mark, stop.

303
00:13:33,339 --> 00:13:34,972
If you loved me...

304
00:13:34,974 --> 00:13:36,007
No.

305
00:13:36,009 --> 00:13:38,075
- No, do not say that.
- No, it's true.

306
00:13:38,077 --> 00:13:40,144
If you really loved me...

307
00:13:40,146 --> 00:13:42,246
I'm trying to protect you
<i>because</i> I love you.

308
00:13:42,248 --> 00:13:45,416
I don't need your <i>protection.</i>

309
00:13:47,653 --> 00:13:50,134
I need your <i>support.</i>

310
00:13:50,256 --> 00:13:52,890
We'll start prepping you
first thing in the morning.

311
00:13:52,892 --> 00:13:54,992
Try and get some sleep.

312
00:13:54,994 --> 00:13:56,894
Thank you.

313
00:14:09,042 --> 00:14:10,941
I still can't believe it.

314
00:14:13,992 --> 00:14:16,974
That 18-year-old
college students do porn?

315
00:14:17,417 --> 00:14:19,350
She's just not the type.

316
00:14:19,352 --> 00:14:21,520
How do you know what "type" she is?
You just met her.

317
00:14:21,545 --> 00:14:24,413
Did one medical history and pelvic exam.

318
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,693
What?

319
00:14:28,695 --> 00:14:29,760
Nothing.

320
00:14:29,762 --> 00:14:31,295
No, go ahead.

321
00:14:31,297 --> 00:14:32,897
Tell me all the reasons why I'm wrong.

322
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:39,236
I volunteered at a shelter
for runaway teens

323
00:14:39,238 --> 00:14:40,805
when I was at high school.

324
00:14:40,807 --> 00:14:42,940
Got to know a lot of sex workers.

325
00:14:42,942 --> 00:14:44,408
They're not all the same,

326
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:50,478
but they do have the same...

327
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:52,642
armor.

328
00:14:53,862 --> 00:14:55,797
I don't believe it.

329
00:14:55,822 --> 00:14:57,755
- You think I'm lying?
- No.

330
00:14:57,757 --> 00:14:59,924
No, I think you just opened up to me,

331
00:14:59,926 --> 00:15:02,393
actually shared something personal.

332
00:15:02,395 --> 00:15:04,528
It was highschool community service.

333
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:05,696
It's not a big deal.

334
00:15:05,698 --> 00:15:06,997
Oh, no, it's a big deal.

335
00:15:06,999 --> 00:15:08,532
- This is huge.
- Mm?

336
00:15:08,534 --> 00:15:10,501
- I am peeling the onion.
- Shut up.

337
00:15:10,503 --> 00:15:12,169
Actually, it's more like
hacking through a coconut

338
00:15:12,171 --> 00:15:13,270
with a dull machete, but...

339
00:15:13,272 --> 00:15:14,405
"Dull" is right.

340
00:15:14,407 --> 00:15:16,607
Very dull.

341
00:15:16,609 --> 00:15:18,606
It feels good, doesn't it?

342
00:15:18,988 --> 00:15:20,588
You should do it more often.

343
00:15:20,966 --> 00:15:26,840
How about you stop worrying
about what I <i>won't</i> do

344
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,353
and just enjoy what I <i>will?</i>

345
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:41,009
Do you think she's of sound mind?

346
00:15:41,467 --> 00:15:44,468
You really want to talk
about work right now?

347
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:46,670
She's basically threatening
to commit suicide.

348
00:15:46,672 --> 00:15:48,672
She's not suicidal.

349
00:15:48,674 --> 00:15:51,509
She's... She's just desperate
to have a child.

350
00:15:51,511 --> 00:15:52,843
This is probably her last chance.

351
00:15:52,845 --> 00:15:54,745
She could adopt.

352
00:15:54,747 --> 00:15:57,378
- It's not the same.
- Really?

353
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:59,183
You don't think there's a difference?

354
00:15:59,185 --> 00:16:00,484
No, I don't.

355
00:16:00,486 --> 00:16:03,387
Carrying a fetus in your body
for nine months.

356
00:16:03,389 --> 00:16:05,990
You don't think that creates
a unique relationship?

357
00:16:05,992 --> 00:16:08,325
I think every relationship is unique.

358
00:16:08,327 --> 00:16:10,394
Yeah, of course.

359
00:16:10,396 --> 00:16:11,729
What are you saying?

360
00:16:11,731 --> 00:16:14,165
I just think it's selfish.

361
00:16:14,167 --> 00:16:15,699
I mean, for her to go through so much,

362
00:16:15,701 --> 00:16:17,902
to put your husband through so much,

363
00:16:17,904 --> 00:16:19,637
just so you can have
a certain experience

364
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:22,006
when there are other ways.

365
00:16:22,008 --> 00:16:23,841
Yeah, okay.

366
00:16:23,843 --> 00:16:26,610
But... you want children, though, right?

367
00:16:26,612 --> 00:16:28,112
We've talked about this before.

368
00:16:28,114 --> 00:16:30,214
Yes, I-I want children.

369
00:16:30,216 --> 00:16:31,682
But <i>our</i> children.

370
00:16:31,684 --> 00:16:33,184
Like, from you getting pregnant.

371
00:16:33,186 --> 00:16:34,885
Yes.

372
00:16:36,521 --> 00:16:38,422
But what if that doesn't happen?

373
00:16:38,424 --> 00:16:41,225
What if I couldn't get pregnant

374
00:16:41,227 --> 00:16:44,328
or if I decided that I didn't want to?

375
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:46,096
That I wanted to adopt instead?

376
00:16:46,098 --> 00:16:48,666
Is there something
you're not telling me?

377
00:16:48,668 --> 00:16:50,201
Actually, there is.

378
00:16:51,503 --> 00:16:53,103
When we're in meetings together,

379
00:16:53,105 --> 00:16:55,072
don't ever call my ideas "ridiculous."

380
00:16:55,074 --> 00:16:56,607
Come on, I'm being serious.

381
00:16:56,609 --> 00:16:58,375
So am I.

382
00:17:00,212 --> 00:17:01,537
Okay.

383
00:17:01,681 --> 00:17:03,948
You're right. I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.

384
00:17:27,372 --> 00:17:28,539
Geez, you scared me.

385
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:30,441
- What're you reading?
- Nothing.

386
00:17:30,443 --> 00:17:31,976
- Can I read it?
- No.

387
00:17:31,978 --> 00:17:33,651
- Why?
- Because.

388
00:17:33,815 --> 00:17:34,845
Why?

389
00:17:34,847 --> 00:17:36,614
Because.

390
00:17:36,616 --> 00:17:39,315
Why?

391
00:17:39,823 --> 00:17:42,801
Because there's nothing to read.

392
00:17:42,889 --> 00:17:44,521
Just pictures.

393
00:17:44,523 --> 00:17:45,723
Where'd you get this?

394
00:17:45,725 --> 00:17:47,291
Colleen Myers.

395
00:17:47,293 --> 00:17:48,959
Her dad has so many in his closet,

396
00:17:48,961 --> 00:17:51,161
he doesn't even notice
when she takes a few.

397
00:17:51,163 --> 00:17:53,063
She's pretty.

398
00:17:53,065 --> 00:17:54,665
She sure is.

399
00:17:55,935 --> 00:17:57,668
It's bedtime.

400
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:58,836
That means lights out.

401
00:18:16,145 --> 00:18:17,600
I missed my stop.

402
00:18:17,795 --> 00:18:20,024
I missed my stop!

403
00:18:20,026 --> 00:18:21,678
Lynwood Place!

404
00:18:21,703 --> 00:18:23,670
I need to get off at Lynwood Place.

405
00:18:23,763 --> 00:18:25,396
Well, then you should've
been paying attention

406
00:18:25,398 --> 00:18:28,180
when I stopped at Lynwood Place.

407
00:18:28,401 --> 00:18:30,200
Next stop's gonna be even further away,

408
00:18:30,202 --> 00:18:31,727
so if I were you...

409
00:19:18,649 --> 00:19:20,049
Shaun?

410
00:19:20,097 --> 00:19:22,130
Are you okay?

411
00:19:22,196 --> 00:19:23,542
Yes.

412
00:19:23,612 --> 00:19:25,512
Are you waiting for someone?

413
00:19:25,537 --> 00:19:27,370
No.

414
00:19:30,842 --> 00:19:33,267
I'm horrible at directions, too.

415
00:19:33,486 --> 00:19:36,946
Every time I exit a BART station,
I walk like three blocks

416
00:19:36,948 --> 00:19:40,260
before I realize
I'm going the wrong direction.

417
00:19:40,652 --> 00:19:43,275
You're lucky
I actually made it to the gym.

418
00:19:43,421 --> 00:19:45,455
I like to go when it's not crowded,

419
00:19:45,457 --> 00:19:48,024
but it's so hard to motivate after work.

420
00:19:48,026 --> 00:19:49,292
Half the time I end up not...

421
00:19:49,294 --> 00:19:51,821
You stink.

422
00:19:52,263 --> 00:19:53,819
I know. I'm disgusting.

423
00:19:53,898 --> 00:19:56,069
But I can't shower there.

424
00:19:56,167 --> 00:19:58,709
I'm terrified of foot fungus.

425
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:01,170
Hey, you know, as long as we're
tossing out truth grenades,

426
00:20:01,172 --> 00:20:02,905
you suck at being a neighbor.

427
00:20:02,907 --> 00:20:04,932
First, you take back your batteries,

428
00:20:05,043 --> 00:20:07,043
and then you wake me up
in the middle of the night

429
00:20:07,045 --> 00:20:09,512
stomping around and banging on pipes.

430
00:20:09,514 --> 00:20:10,813
What the hell's up with that?

431
00:20:10,815 --> 00:20:12,581
My sink drips.

432
00:20:12,698 --> 00:20:14,517
I couldn't sleep, so I tried to fix it.

433
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:16,252
Then I couldn't find my screwdriver,

434
00:20:16,254 --> 00:20:17,687
which made me anxious.

435
00:20:17,689 --> 00:20:19,455
You kept me up because you were anxious

436
00:20:19,457 --> 00:20:20,890
about a screwdriver?

437
00:20:20,892 --> 00:20:23,493
Yes. I was very anxious.

438
00:20:23,948 --> 00:20:26,499
You're funny.

439
00:20:26,698 --> 00:20:29,432
I stink. You're anxious.

440
00:20:29,569 --> 00:20:32,530
You always say
exactly what's on your mind.

441
00:20:32,704 --> 00:20:35,238
It's the total opposite of most guys.

442
00:20:36,272 --> 00:20:38,182
It's nice.

443
00:20:47,418 --> 00:20:49,446
Good night.

444
00:20:49,621 --> 00:20:52,188
And don't go fixing any faucets tonight.

445
00:20:52,223 --> 00:20:53,389
That's Armen's job.

446
00:21:12,719 --> 00:21:15,988
This is a list of repairs
I need for my apartment.

447
00:21:16,147 --> 00:21:17,914
Number 33.

448
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:19,816
What the hell is your problem?

449
00:21:20,236 --> 00:21:21,718
Sorry. Hello.

450
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,275
My name is Shaun Murphy.
It's very nice to meet you.

451
00:21:24,433 --> 00:21:28,806
No, it's not nice
to meet me at 12:40 a.m.

452
00:21:28,893 --> 00:21:30,600
Yes.

453
00:21:30,662 --> 00:21:32,428
Dr. Glassman said I can call you

454
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:34,108
any time I need something fixed.

455
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:35,507
Who the hell is Dr. Glassman?

456
00:21:35,532 --> 00:21:38,500
He's the president at San Jose
St. Bonaventure Hospital.

457
00:21:38,525 --> 00:21:40,091
I'm a surgical resident there.

458
00:21:40,116 --> 00:21:43,038
Well, I don't care if you're
St. Bonaventure himself.

459
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:46,909
Unless it's a fire or flood,
I only work 9:00 to 5:00.

460
00:21:46,911 --> 00:21:48,554
Mm, I'll...

461
00:21:48,713 --> 00:21:50,813
try and come back tomorrow
between those times.

462
00:21:50,815 --> 00:21:54,450
You already woke me up.
Just give me the damn list.

463
00:21:58,056 --> 00:21:59,643
It's my fault.

464
00:21:59,758 --> 00:22:03,092
I should've known you would
take what I said literally.

465
00:22:03,094 --> 00:22:04,660
It's okay.

466
00:22:05,481 --> 00:22:08,231
Actually, you know what, Shaun?
It's not my fault.

467
00:22:08,385 --> 00:22:10,785
It's your responsibility. You're smart.

468
00:22:10,835 --> 00:22:12,869
You should be able
to use your common sense.

469
00:22:12,871 --> 00:22:14,337
When somebody says something,

470
00:22:14,339 --> 00:22:16,539
you should figure out
what they really mean.

471
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:20,676
And when things don't go
exactly how you expected them,

472
00:22:20,678 --> 00:22:22,445
navigate that.

473
00:22:27,452 --> 00:22:31,079
There's a thing called
a Personal Support Worker.

474
00:22:31,196 --> 00:22:32,855
Think of it like a home health aide.

475
00:22:32,857 --> 00:22:34,023
No, thank you.

476
00:22:34,025 --> 00:22:35,458
I can take care of myself.

477
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,460
Everybody needs
a little help now and then.

478
00:22:37,462 --> 00:22:40,062
I-I'm thinking of asking them
to give me one.

479
00:22:40,064 --> 00:22:42,064
I've lived by myself a long time.

480
00:22:42,066 --> 00:22:44,267
In Casper, Wyoming.

481
00:22:44,269 --> 00:22:45,935
Everybody looked out for you in Casper.

482
00:22:45,937 --> 00:22:47,637
Everybody looks out
for everybody in Casper.

483
00:22:47,639 --> 00:22:49,438
This is San Jose. It's a big city.

484
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,408
And residency is a whole lot
more demanding than medical...

485
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:53,576
I don't need an aide.

486
00:22:53,578 --> 00:22:54,644
We're just talking, Shaun.

487
00:22:54,646 --> 00:22:56,708
- I don't need an aide!
- Okay, okay.

488
00:22:56,733 --> 00:22:58,559
Okay.

489
00:22:58,734 --> 00:23:00,669
- Okay.
- Okay.

490
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:04,487
We'll table it for some other time.

491
00:23:06,076 --> 00:23:09,178
Let's enjoy our breakfast, okay?

492
00:23:17,201 --> 00:23:19,259
Mr. Allen?

493
00:23:19,673 --> 00:23:21,871
I'm trying to convince her
to save herself.

494
00:23:21,873 --> 00:23:23,840
I don't want to roll the dice
with my wife's life.

495
00:23:23,841 --> 00:23:25,703
But she does.

496
00:23:25,877 --> 00:23:27,076
We're gonna start prepping her now,

497
00:23:27,078 --> 00:23:29,546
and she goes into the O.R.
in a few hours.

498
00:23:30,014 --> 00:23:31,714
I understand why <i>she's</i> desperate.

499
00:23:31,716 --> 00:23:33,601
But not why <i>you</i> are.

500
00:23:34,586 --> 00:23:36,465
If she dies, it's your fault.

501
00:23:36,688 --> 00:23:38,855
And what if she lives?

502
00:23:40,591 --> 00:23:42,574
You're gonna have a wife
and child who need you,

503
00:23:42,627 --> 00:23:45,051
and you keep driving her
out of your life.

504
00:23:45,396 --> 00:23:47,235
I'm not <i>desperate.</i>

505
00:23:47,365 --> 00:23:49,118
I'm <i>confident.</i>

506
00:23:49,334 --> 00:23:51,167
Which should make you feel better.

507
00:24:01,675 --> 00:24:03,341
Retraction.

508
00:24:03,414 --> 00:24:04,780
I'll make the incision,

509
00:24:04,782 --> 00:24:07,344
and then I want you
to insert the Word catheter.

510
00:24:07,785 --> 00:24:10,034
Good job on the pelvic exam, Dr. Murphy.

511
00:24:10,059 --> 00:24:11,821
With all this swelling,
it couldn't have been easy.

512
00:24:11,823 --> 00:24:12,822
Thank you.

513
00:24:12,824 --> 00:24:14,123
How do you know who...

514
00:24:14,125 --> 00:24:15,725
Oh, I have my ways.

515
00:24:15,727 --> 00:24:16,726
Like Santa.

516
00:24:16,728 --> 00:24:18,160
- I told him.
- Hm.

517
00:24:18,162 --> 00:24:19,295
No presents for you.

518
00:24:19,297 --> 00:24:20,363
Insert the drain.

519
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,696
But I'm curious.

520
00:24:24,769 --> 00:24:27,570
How could a guy who can't
even shake a co-worker's hand

521
00:24:27,572 --> 00:24:30,406
be comfortable doing a pelvic exam?

522
00:24:30,408 --> 00:24:32,642
People squeeze too hard. It hurts.

523
00:24:32,644 --> 00:24:35,310
Send this to the lab for culture.

524
00:24:36,447 --> 00:24:39,115
So, I'm guessing
you're not that into hugs.

525
00:24:39,117 --> 00:24:41,517
I don't like to be squeezed.

526
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:43,519
Well, what if it's somebody you like?

527
00:24:43,521 --> 00:24:45,121
Or somebody you love?

528
00:24:45,123 --> 00:24:46,989
Have you ever had a girlfriend?

529
00:24:48,892 --> 00:24:51,560
I almost kissed a girl. Once.

530
00:24:51,562 --> 00:24:52,762
Well, you know what they say...

531
00:24:52,764 --> 00:24:55,173
If at first you don't succeed...

532
00:24:55,413 --> 00:24:57,746
Are you trying to mock me
or encourage me?

533
00:24:57,835 --> 00:24:59,535
I'm trying to get to know you

534
00:24:59,537 --> 00:25:02,805
so I know when I should mock
and when I should encourage.

535
00:25:02,971 --> 00:25:05,398
When's the right time to mock <i>you?</i>

536
00:25:11,683 --> 00:25:13,683
Press harder on that abscess.

537
00:25:13,685 --> 00:25:14,984
It should have drained by now.

538
00:25:14,986 --> 00:25:16,719
Something's wrong.

539
00:25:16,721 --> 00:25:19,822
The gland's evacuated, but
the swelling's not going down.

540
00:25:19,824 --> 00:25:21,290
Heart rate and BP are stable.

541
00:25:21,292 --> 00:25:23,375
Can I get a little more light, please?

542
00:25:24,963 --> 00:25:26,662
- Damn.
- What is it?

543
00:25:26,664 --> 00:25:28,164
The swelling isn't going down

544
00:25:28,166 --> 00:25:30,366
because there's a mass
beneath the abscess.

545
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:32,768
And it's not just pressing
on the pudendal nerve...

546
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:33,903
It's totally engulfed it.

547
00:25:33,905 --> 00:25:36,305
- That's bad.
- Very bad.

548
00:25:43,562 --> 00:25:46,390
You're done already?

549
00:25:48,024 --> 00:25:50,792
We were able to drain the abscess.

550
00:25:51,048 --> 00:25:52,865
I already feel better.

551
00:25:52,889 --> 00:25:54,498
That's only because of the pain meds.

552
00:25:54,538 --> 00:25:56,104
The reason the pain was so severe

553
00:25:56,106 --> 00:25:57,773
was because it wasn't just an abscess.

554
00:25:57,775 --> 00:26:00,068
There's perineal myoma underneath.

555
00:26:00,234 --> 00:26:01,967
What's that?

556
00:26:02,024 --> 00:26:04,131
A fibroid tumor.

557
00:26:04,638 --> 00:26:08,784
It's not cancerous, but it is
wrapped around the nerve.

558
00:26:08,786 --> 00:26:10,252
We need to remove the tumor,

559
00:26:10,254 --> 00:26:13,922
but to do that,
we will have to sever the nerve.

560
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,755
You'll lose all feeling
in your genitals.

561
00:26:17,828 --> 00:26:19,661
I'm so sorry.

562
00:26:20,754 --> 00:26:22,531
I knew it.

563
00:26:25,228 --> 00:26:26,528
God's punishing me.

564
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:28,237
No, absolutely not.

565
00:26:28,239 --> 00:26:30,600
- This is just a random growth...
- You're religious?

566
00:26:30,741 --> 00:26:32,037
Yes.

567
00:26:32,129 --> 00:26:35,330
Or at least I used to be.

568
00:26:37,013 --> 00:26:39,748
I haven't thought about God
in a really long time.

569
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:42,584
But being in here...

570
00:26:42,586 --> 00:26:44,820
You sure you don't want us
to call your parents?

571
00:26:44,822 --> 00:26:48,528
No. I couldn't bear to see
the look on their faces.

572
00:26:49,579 --> 00:26:51,245
Especially my dad's.

573
00:26:51,809 --> 00:26:54,543
Well, that's what parents are for.

574
00:26:54,865 --> 00:26:57,099
So you don't have
to do these things alone.

575
00:26:57,677 --> 00:27:00,473
Could you tell your father
you're a whore?

576
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:03,395
You made a mistake.

577
00:27:03,774 --> 00:27:05,274
That is all.

578
00:27:11,181 --> 00:27:13,482
- Patient vitals?
- Stable.

579
00:27:13,484 --> 00:27:14,916
- Fetus?
- Stable.

580
00:27:14,918 --> 00:27:16,318
Okay.

581
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,487
Is everybody ready?

582
00:27:18,489 --> 00:27:19,755
Knife.

583
00:27:32,235 --> 00:27:33,368
Retractor.

584
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:49,221
Okay.

585
00:27:49,386 --> 00:27:51,119
Cutting into the uterus.

586
00:27:55,993 --> 00:27:58,093
T.E.E. is showing
anterior wall hypokinesis.

587
00:27:58,095 --> 00:27:59,928
Systolic pressure 90. Get me a Swan.

588
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:01,723
- I.V. function is decreasing.
- She's having a heart attack.

589
00:28:01,725 --> 00:28:02,910
I need you to close the incision.

590
00:28:02,935 --> 00:28:05,012
- On it. Needle driver.
- Get a fluoroscope in here!

591
00:28:05,037 --> 00:28:07,102
I'm gonna prep her for a balloon pump.

592
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:11,837
Barbara?

593
00:28:12,743 --> 00:28:15,010
There was a complication during surgery.

594
00:28:15,012 --> 00:28:17,446
A blood clot blocked
an artery in your heart.

595
00:28:17,448 --> 00:28:19,258
We were able to catch it in time.

596
00:28:19,321 --> 00:28:20,582
And my baby?

597
00:28:20,584 --> 00:28:22,422
The fetus is stable.

598
00:28:23,087 --> 00:28:26,141
The M.I. happened
before we opened the uterus.

599
00:28:26,457 --> 00:28:28,457
So, we're right back where we started?

600
00:28:29,005 --> 00:28:30,864
You just had a heart attack.

601
00:28:30,928 --> 00:28:32,027
I don't care.

602
00:28:32,029 --> 00:28:33,695
There is no other option now.

603
00:28:33,697 --> 00:28:36,131
If we don't terminate
and the fetus dies in utero,

604
00:28:36,133 --> 00:28:38,633
the resulting clots will
overwhelm your heart and brain.

605
00:28:38,635 --> 00:28:40,802
Which is exactly why we need
to try again.

606
00:28:42,581 --> 00:28:44,393
What're you talking about?

607
00:28:44,503 --> 00:28:46,208
You need to remove the tumor.

608
00:28:48,946 --> 00:28:51,275
You begged me
not to do the surgery before.

609
00:28:51,462 --> 00:28:53,229
I thought I could talk her
out of it then.

610
00:28:53,317 --> 00:28:55,447
Now I know I can't.

611
00:28:56,019 --> 00:28:58,053
Either you do it, or she dies.

612
00:29:01,625 --> 00:29:03,125
Before, if we got sued,

613
00:29:03,127 --> 00:29:04,893
we'd at least have
one of them on our side,

614
00:29:04,895 --> 00:29:06,962
but now, with them both aligned...

615
00:29:06,964 --> 00:29:09,231
Can they sue us for not operating?

616
00:29:09,233 --> 00:29:11,333
They could argue that we abandoned care.

617
00:29:11,335 --> 00:29:12,734
We're still offering care.

618
00:29:12,736 --> 00:29:13,969
Just not the care that they want.

619
00:29:13,971 --> 00:29:15,908
Which is your fault.

620
00:29:16,206 --> 00:29:18,840
If you hadn't offered her
hope to begin with,

621
00:29:18,842 --> 00:29:20,308
we might have been able
to reason with her.

622
00:29:20,619 --> 00:29:22,511
How's the pain around the incision?

623
00:29:22,513 --> 00:29:24,179
5 out of 10.

624
00:29:24,181 --> 00:29:25,514
I'll up the dosage.

625
00:29:25,516 --> 00:29:26,848
Any chest pain?

626
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:28,884
No. My heart actually feels fine.

627
00:29:30,151 --> 00:29:32,003
Good.

628
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:39,371
If she doesn't want to terminate,
there's nothing we can do.

629
00:29:39,396 --> 00:29:41,681
- So we just send her home to die?
- It is her decision.

630
00:29:41,706 --> 00:29:43,098
We could tell her we were going ahead

631
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,132
with the fetal surgery.

632
00:29:44,134 --> 00:29:46,601
- But once she's under...
- I'm gonna pretend you never said that.

633
00:29:46,603 --> 00:29:48,270
If it's the only chance
to save her life...

634
00:29:48,272 --> 00:29:49,738
This is exactly what I'm talking about.

635
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,940
You wouldn't lie to convince
a suicidal person

636
00:29:51,942 --> 00:29:53,041
to climb down off the ledge?

637
00:29:53,043 --> 00:29:54,509
Knowingly lying to a patient

638
00:29:54,511 --> 00:29:56,966
- about a major medical surgery...
- Okay, okay! Hey!

639
00:29:57,255 --> 00:29:59,147
Lying to a patient is one thing.

640
00:29:59,149 --> 00:30:00,882
Performing surgery
without their consent...

641
00:30:00,884 --> 00:30:03,507
- It's unethical and illegal.
- And insane.

642
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:04,991
I just...

643
00:30:05,055 --> 00:30:06,455
I don't want to do this.

644
00:30:12,162 --> 00:30:13,829
It's not our only option.

645
00:30:13,956 --> 00:30:16,398
You want me to attempt
the fetal surgery again?

646
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,999
If it's the only way to save her life.

647
00:30:18,001 --> 00:30:19,901
The first time, it was
the only way to save her life.

648
00:30:19,926 --> 00:30:21,184
But a second heart attack

649
00:30:21,209 --> 00:30:23,103
one day after the first will kill her.

650
00:30:23,128 --> 00:30:24,339
Maybe not.

651
00:30:24,341 --> 00:30:27,425
I am so sorry to interrupt, but I...

652
00:30:27,611 --> 00:30:29,668
I have an idea.

653
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,347
What if we kill her
before she kills herself?

654
00:30:36,687 --> 00:30:39,387
We'll stop your heart and
put you on a bypass machine

655
00:30:39,389 --> 00:30:40,589
for the duration of the surgery.

656
00:30:40,591 --> 00:30:41,823
You can't have a heart attack

657
00:30:41,825 --> 00:30:43,525
if your heart's
not beating to begin with.

658
00:30:43,527 --> 00:30:45,560
It takes the most significant
danger off the table.

659
00:30:45,562 --> 00:30:47,796
But aren't the clots a danger
to her brain, as well?

660
00:30:47,798 --> 00:30:50,065
This doesn't completely
eliminate every risk,

661
00:30:50,067 --> 00:30:52,534
but it does reduce the biggest one.

662
00:30:54,605 --> 00:30:56,037
Thank you.

663
00:30:56,767 --> 00:30:58,837
We'll do it first thing in the morning.

664
00:31:29,091 --> 00:31:31,252
You fixed my sink!

665
00:31:31,611 --> 00:31:33,074
Do you know how to tell time?

666
00:31:33,076 --> 00:31:34,609
You fixed my sink!

667
00:31:34,611 --> 00:31:36,545
You're welcome. Now go away.

668
00:31:36,547 --> 00:31:38,880
It was not on the list!

669
00:31:38,882 --> 00:31:40,715
The faucet. It was not on the list.

670
00:31:40,717 --> 00:31:42,591
You weren't supposed to touch it.

671
00:31:42,808 --> 00:31:46,513
So after I fix everything
you woke me up for,

672
00:31:46,723 --> 00:31:48,823
then I go out of my way
to fix something el...

673
00:31:48,825 --> 00:31:51,527
It was not on the list
because I'd already fixed it.

674
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:53,309
Well, you fixed it wrong.

675
00:31:53,397 --> 00:31:55,792
- Because it was still dripping.
- I need it to drip.

676
00:31:55,866 --> 00:31:58,099
At the same rate as my sink in Casper.

677
00:31:58,101 --> 00:31:59,334
It was too slow before.

678
00:31:59,336 --> 00:32:00,969
Now I have to fix it all over again.

679
00:32:00,971 --> 00:32:02,592
It's not fair.

680
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,293
I'm done.

681
00:32:04,374 --> 00:32:05,840
If you don't like your faucet

682
00:32:05,842 --> 00:32:08,443
or anything else
in your apartment? Move.

683
00:32:08,445 --> 00:32:11,780
If you knock on this door
again after 5:00 p.m.,

684
00:32:11,934 --> 00:32:14,365
I'm gonna knock your teeth out.

685
00:34:26,049 --> 00:34:27,915
- Nerves are like pipes!
- Shaun, th... this...

686
00:34:27,917 --> 00:34:30,518
We need to sever the pudendal
nerve to excise the myoma,

687
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,153
but if we reconnect the ends...

688
00:34:32,155 --> 00:34:34,255
The tumor is 4 centimeters in diameter.

689
00:34:34,257 --> 00:34:36,223
That's way too wide of a gap
to reconnect the ends,

690
00:34:36,225 --> 00:34:37,458
and nerves don't stretch.

691
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,893
We don't need to stretch it.

692
00:34:38,895 --> 00:34:41,429
We can connect the distal end
of the pudendal nerve

693
00:34:41,431 --> 00:34:43,097
to the branch
of the femoral cutaneous nerve

694
00:34:43,099 --> 00:34:45,066
from her inner thigh.

695
00:34:47,029 --> 00:34:50,171
Would you rather lose feeling
in your thigh or genitals?

696
00:34:50,631 --> 00:34:52,440
Thigh, definitely.

697
00:34:53,365 --> 00:34:55,271
Is he right?

698
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:56,725
Can we do that?

699
00:34:57,185 --> 00:34:58,946
It probably would've been better

700
00:34:58,948 --> 00:35:01,998
to discuss this prior
to meeting with the patient,

701
00:35:02,303 --> 00:35:04,607
but, yes, I think it could work.

702
00:35:09,792 --> 00:35:12,007
Cut the suture.

703
00:35:15,298 --> 00:35:18,766
Grafted nerve's in place.
Let's see if it will conduct.

704
00:35:28,778 --> 00:35:31,579
Conduction electrodes are in position.

705
00:35:31,581 --> 00:35:32,613
Send a pulse.

706
00:35:36,953 --> 00:35:37,952
Again.

707
00:35:39,088 --> 00:35:40,855
Again.

708
00:35:41,891 --> 00:35:43,190
- Again.
- Okay, Murphy, we get it.

709
00:35:43,192 --> 00:35:44,358
Your idea worked.

710
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,359
Good job. Both of you.

711
00:35:45,361 --> 00:35:47,634
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

712
00:35:47,964 --> 00:35:51,966
I'm guessing Melendez doesn't
let you know this enough,

713
00:35:51,968 --> 00:35:54,135
but you both are doing a great job.

714
00:35:54,137 --> 00:35:57,704
And if either of you needs
anything, even just to talk,

715
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:00,081
my door's always open.

716
00:36:00,349 --> 00:36:02,643
- 4-0 Vicryl.
- Yes, doctor.

717
00:36:02,711 --> 00:36:04,072
4-0 Vicryl.

718
00:36:06,783 --> 00:36:08,749
She's on bypass.

719
00:36:09,851 --> 00:36:11,452
Cross clamping the aorta.

720
00:36:17,627 --> 00:36:18,993
You ready?

721
00:36:20,562 --> 00:36:21,629
Flush the heart.

722
00:36:21,631 --> 00:36:22,630
Flushing.

723
00:36:30,849 --> 00:36:32,889
Let's prep her for C-section.

724
00:36:40,491 --> 00:36:42,491
Dr. Andrews.

725
00:36:43,361 --> 00:36:45,037
The operation went perfectly.

726
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,863
But I don't feel anything down there.

727
00:36:47,865 --> 00:36:49,265
You're still on the meds,
so it's gonna...

728
00:36:49,267 --> 00:36:50,866
It's going to take six months to a year

729
00:36:50,868 --> 00:36:52,861
to regain complete sensation.

730
00:36:53,004 --> 00:36:54,603
It'll take a while for your brain

731
00:36:54,605 --> 00:36:56,071
to figure out what we did.

732
00:36:56,073 --> 00:36:58,407
But the grafted nerve
is fully conducting.

733
00:36:58,409 --> 00:36:59,842
You're gonna be fine.

734
00:36:59,844 --> 00:37:01,076
Thank you.

735
00:37:01,562 --> 00:37:03,712
Can you do me a favor?

736
00:37:03,714 --> 00:37:04,847
Sure.

737
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:08,417
Call my parents.

738
00:37:08,897 --> 00:37:10,686
Absolutely.

739
00:37:16,661 --> 00:37:17,924
Knife.

740
00:37:18,104 --> 00:37:19,596
Knife.

741
00:37:44,388 --> 00:37:45,952
Bovie.

742
00:37:46,002 --> 00:37:47,721
Bovie.

743
00:37:59,737 --> 00:38:01,370
How're we on bypass?

744
00:38:05,586 --> 00:38:08,331
- Dr. Kalu, you still with us?
- Yeah.

745
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,813
Oh. Um, central venous pressure's good.

746
00:38:10,815 --> 00:38:12,522
Bypass oxygen tension's 200.

747
00:38:12,616 --> 00:38:15,084
- Good.
- Repairing the fetal sacrum.

748
00:38:15,086 --> 00:38:17,194
Gonna put this baby
back where it belongs.

749
00:38:18,007 --> 00:38:19,740
Baby?

750
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:22,424
That's the first time
you didn't call it a fetus.

751
00:38:23,566 --> 00:38:25,167
Just an expression.

752
00:38:36,874 --> 00:38:38,107
I told you.

753
00:38:38,288 --> 00:38:40,342
Yes, you did.

754
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:43,710
You're gonna need to stay in bed
for the next four months...

755
00:38:43,848 --> 00:38:46,281
but both you and your son's
prognosis is excellent.

756
00:38:46,979 --> 00:38:48,317
Hey.

757
00:38:48,643 --> 00:38:50,753
We wanted it to be a surprise.

758
00:38:50,799 --> 00:38:52,698
Oops.

759
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:54,690
Rookie mistake.

760
00:38:58,663 --> 00:39:00,229
Yes!

761
00:39:00,231 --> 00:39:02,831
We are definitely celebrating tonight.

762
00:39:02,833 --> 00:39:05,034
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Screw sleep, Murphy.

763
00:39:05,036 --> 00:39:06,735
You are coming with us.

764
00:39:06,737 --> 00:39:08,170
- Where are you going?
- Out.

765
00:39:08,172 --> 00:39:09,972
- We're gonna drink.
- I'm not thirsty.

766
00:39:09,974 --> 00:39:11,607
- Don't be an idiot.
- Hey.

767
00:39:11,609 --> 00:39:13,175
I just meant...

768
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:14,743
Come on, mate.

769
00:39:14,745 --> 00:39:17,423
You just saved
an 18 year-old girl's sex life.

770
00:39:17,748 --> 00:39:19,081
And I saved two lives.

771
00:39:19,083 --> 00:39:20,516
We are drinking.

772
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:24,253
Come on, Shaun.

773
00:39:26,877 --> 00:39:28,455
Okay.

774
00:39:28,759 --> 00:39:30,666
Cool.

775
00:39:30,895 --> 00:39:34,029
♪ Baby, there's nothing
holdin' me back ♪

776

777
00:39:44,341 --> 00:39:45,711
All right.

778
00:39:45,736 --> 00:39:48,133
I have to go home now.

779
00:39:48,285 --> 00:39:50,051
It'll be okay. Don't worry.

780
00:39:50,139 --> 00:39:51,505
We won't stay long.

783
00:40:17,273 --> 00:40:19,558
Hi, Shaun.

784
00:40:20,177 --> 00:40:22,129
Hi, Colleen.

785
00:40:22,706 --> 00:40:25,740
I heard Steve showed you
my dad's magazine.

786
00:40:25,883 --> 00:40:27,516
Did you like it?

787
00:40:30,257 --> 00:40:32,558
Don't worry. I'm not gonna tell anyone.

788
00:40:34,891 --> 00:40:37,207
It's nothing to be embarrassed about.

789
00:40:37,461 --> 00:40:40,137
All guys like that kind of stuff.

790
00:40:41,583 --> 00:40:43,449
You want to know a secret about me?

791
00:40:44,869 --> 00:40:46,301
I think you're really cute.

792
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:49,605
You smell like bubble gum.

793
00:40:49,607 --> 00:40:51,773
I know. It's my lip gloss.

794
00:40:54,812 --> 00:40:56,111
Come here.

795
00:40:57,714 --> 00:40:59,833
Come here, silly.

796
00:41:02,786 --> 00:41:04,119
Do you think I'm pretty?

797
00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:07,723
I like you, too.

798
00:41:11,795 --> 00:41:13,996
I'll show you mine if you show me yours.

799
00:41:16,966 --> 00:41:19,290
Come on. I'm curious.

800
00:41:19,904 --> 00:41:21,667
You must be curious.

801
00:41:22,112 --> 00:41:23,924
Can I have a kiss?

802
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:27,606
I want to know what it feels like.

803
00:41:28,168 --> 00:41:30,231
I'll give you a kiss...

804
00:41:30,318 --> 00:41:31,517
if you show me.

805
00:41:31,801 --> 00:41:33,028
Show you what?

806
00:41:33,095 --> 00:41:35,095
You know. Pull down your pants.

807
00:41:35,152 --> 00:41:36,185
No.

808
00:41:36,187 --> 00:41:37,991
Come on, Shaun.

809
00:41:38,083 --> 00:41:40,383
No. I gotta go.

810
00:41:42,211 --> 00:41:44,393
Oh, my God. I can't believe
you were about to pull it out.

811
00:41:44,395 --> 00:41:45,627
No, I wasn't!

812
00:41:45,629 --> 00:41:48,478
And like I'd ever kiss
a creepy weirdo like you.

813
00:41:48,577 --> 00:41:51,041
Leave him alone! Come on.
