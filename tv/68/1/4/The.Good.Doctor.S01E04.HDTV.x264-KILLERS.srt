Of course you want to do the surgery.

some patients are going to die.

And then our department's
success rate goes down,

210

The umbilical is 19 inches,

the fetus via Caesarean

- Nerves are like pipes!
- Shaun, th... this...

798
00:34:27,917 --> 00:34:30,518
We need to sever the pudendal
nerve to excise the myoma,

799
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,153
but if we reconnect the ends...

800
00:34:32,155 --> 00:34:34,255
The tumor is 4 centimeters in diameter.

801
00:34:34,257 --> 00:34:36,223
That's way too wide of a gap
to reconnect the ends,

802
00:34:36,225 --> 00:34:37,458
and nerves don't stretch.

803
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,893
We don't need to stretch it.

804
00:34:38,895 --> 00:34:41,429
We can connect the distal end
of the pudendal nerve

805
00:34:41,431 --> 00:34:43,097
to the branch
of the femoral cutaneous nerve

806
00:34:43,099 --> 00:34:45,066
from her inner thigh.

807
00:34:47,029 --> 00:34:50,171
Would you rather lose feeling
in your thigh or genitals?

Can we do that?

811

It probably would've been better

to meeting with the patient,

Did you like it?

923
00:40:30,257 --> 00:40:32,558
Don't worry. I'm not gonna tell anyone.

924
00:40:34,891 --> 00:40:37,207
It's nothing to be embarrassed about.

925
00:40:37,461 --> 00:40:40,137
All guys like that kind of stuff.

926
00:40:41,583 --> 00:40:43,449
You want to know a secret about me?

927
00:40:44,869 --> 00:40:46,301
I think you're really cute.

928
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:49,605
You smell like bubble gum.

929
00:40:49,607 --> 00:40:51,773
I know. It's my lip gloss.

You must be curious.

940
00:41:22,112 --> 00:41:23,924
Can I have a kiss?

941
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:27,606
I want to know what it feels like.

942

I'll give you a kiss...

Show you what?

945

You know. Pull down your pants.

No.

you were about to pull it out.

No, I wasn't!

952
00:41:45,629 --> 00:41:48,478
And like I'd ever kiss
a creepy weirdo like you.
