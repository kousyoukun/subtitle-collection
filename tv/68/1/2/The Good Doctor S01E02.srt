1
00:00:02,703 --> 00:00:04,779
Autism... a mental condition

2
00:00:04,804 --> 00:00:07,867
characterized by
difficulty in communicating.

3
00:00:07,914 --> 00:00:10,525
Does it sound like
I'm describing a surgeon?

4
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:11,721
You saved his life.

5
00:00:11,746 --> 00:00:13,179
I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.

6
00:00:13,297 --> 00:00:15,099
Never forget, you're the smart one

7
00:00:15,101 --> 00:00:16,344
and I'm proud of you, Shaun.

8
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:18,445
My brother went to Heaven...

9
00:00:21,414 --> 00:00:22,914
...in front of my eyes.

10
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:24,848
He's got a serious deficit.

11
00:00:24,873 --> 00:00:26,078
We hire Shaun,

12
00:00:26,103 --> 00:00:28,350
and we give hope to those people
with limitations

13
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:29,842
that those limitations

14
00:00:29,844 --> 00:00:31,807
are not what they think they are,

15
00:00:31,832 --> 00:00:33,729
that they <i>do</i> have a shot!

16
00:00:33,769 --> 00:00:38,104
If Shaun doesn't live up
to everything I know he can do,

17
00:00:38,106 --> 00:00:41,608
I will resign my position
as president of this hospital.

18
00:02:01,262 --> 00:02:02,529
Where to?

19
00:02:02,594 --> 00:02:05,024
San Jose St. Bonaventure Hospital.

20
00:02:05,026 --> 00:02:07,939
I'm a surgical resident.
Today is my first full day.

21
00:02:08,198 --> 00:02:09,831
I meant floor.

22
00:02:09,998 --> 00:02:11,231
Oh, ground floor.

23
00:02:13,268 --> 00:02:14,868
I'm taking the bus.

24
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:20,171

25
00:02:27,816 --> 00:02:30,016
This is Mitchell Brand, 55 years old,

26
00:02:30,018 --> 00:02:32,218
post-op day one
from a radical prostatectomy.

27
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,387
Morning, Mitchell. I'm Dr. Melendez.

28
00:02:34,389 --> 00:02:36,756
These are my residents
Dr. Browne and Dr. Kalu.

29
00:02:36,758 --> 00:02:38,158
Your surgery went perfectly.

30
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,159
Yeah.

31
00:02:39,161 --> 00:02:41,427
Am I ever gonna walk again?

32
00:02:41,429 --> 00:02:43,630
Yes. Of course.

33
00:02:43,632 --> 00:02:45,865
This is Mitchell Brand.
I reviewed his chart.

34
00:02:45,867 --> 00:02:48,034
He's 55 years old from Chicago,

35
00:02:48,036 --> 00:02:49,369
divorced with two children.

36
00:02:49,371 --> 00:02:51,871
You did a radical prostatectomy
on him yesterday.

37
00:02:51,873 --> 00:02:53,373
There are many possible complications

38
00:02:53,398 --> 00:02:54,941
but none related to motor neurons.

39
00:02:54,943 --> 00:02:57,043
There is no chance
you won't be able to walk.

40
00:02:59,948 --> 00:03:02,549
He... he wasn't worried about his legs.

41
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,619
Oh, yes.

42
00:03:06,621 --> 00:03:09,603
There's a significant chance
of impotence.

43
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,758
Dr. Murphy, you're late.

44
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,558
No, the bus was late.

45
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:15,762
The schedule was clear.
They post it online.

46
00:03:15,787 --> 00:03:17,263
But the 4 bus was late which meant...

47
00:03:17,265 --> 00:03:18,878
- You're late.
- Five minutes, we've all been...

48
00:03:18,902 --> 00:03:21,961
On your first day, no less.
It is your responsibility to be here.

49
00:03:21,986 --> 00:03:24,003
If you are not, you have failed
in your responsibility,

50
00:03:24,005 --> 00:03:27,055
- which makes it your fault.
- Okay, how can it be my fault?

51
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,828
- I did nothing wrong. The bus...
- Yeah.

52
00:03:28,853 --> 00:03:29,945
This is gonna work out great.

53
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:31,911
The board clearly made
the right choice in hiring you.

54
00:03:32,539 --> 00:03:34,087
Thank you.

55
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:37,495
Dr. Melendez, we've got
an emergent consult in the E.R.

56
00:03:38,377 --> 00:03:39,509
You should be fine

57
00:03:39,534 --> 00:03:41,217
if you can leave it alone
for a couple days.

58
00:03:42,356 --> 00:03:44,023
Four days of indigestion,

59
00:03:44,025 --> 00:03:45,925
bloating, constipation, and nausea.

60
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:48,087
And a lot of pain, apparently.

61
00:03:48,111 --> 00:03:49,376
Yeah.

62
00:03:49,401 --> 00:03:51,764
- Did you give her morphine?
- Yeah, 10 milligrams.

63
00:03:51,766 --> 00:03:52,834
Hasn't touched her pain.

64
00:03:54,035 --> 00:03:55,335
You have time to get a CT?

65
00:03:55,337 --> 00:03:57,203
Yeah. That's why I called you.

66
00:04:02,143 --> 00:04:03,476
That's very big.

67
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:06,212
Yes, it is.

68
00:04:06,214 --> 00:04:08,081
What are we looking at?

69
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:10,450
It's definitely abutting
the aorta and the left kidney.

70
00:04:10,488 --> 00:04:12,871
Renal angiomyolipoma?

71
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:15,800
- Do you see an extensive blood supply?
- No.

72
00:04:15,893 --> 00:04:18,215
Maybe some kind of neurogenic tumor.

73
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,762
Or maybe a lymphoma.

74
00:04:19,764 --> 00:04:22,364
She has a sarcoma, a malignant tumor.

75
00:04:23,387 --> 00:04:24,621
Malignant?

76
00:04:24,646 --> 00:04:26,573
- That means it's killing me, right?
- Yes.

77
00:04:26,598 --> 00:04:28,904
Not necessarily.
We're just speculating right now.

78
00:04:28,906 --> 00:04:30,726
No. It's definitely malignant.

79
00:04:30,751 --> 00:04:31,861
If it weren't malignant...

80
00:04:31,886 --> 00:04:34,310
- Please stop saying "malignant."
- Should we talk outside?

81
00:04:37,221 --> 00:04:39,948
Give her more morphine.
As much as she wants.

82
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,517
Okay.

83
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,013
You scared her.

84
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,590
- Didn't need to be so blunt.
- Why?

85
00:04:49,967 --> 00:04:51,427
Her prognosis is terminal

86
00:04:51,429 --> 00:04:53,162
without immediate medical intervention.

87
00:04:53,187 --> 00:04:54,263
Isn't that scary?

88
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,132
Well...

89
00:04:57,134 --> 00:04:58,901
That fear does her no good.

90
00:04:59,981 --> 00:05:02,604
Does she have a malignant sarcoma?

91
00:05:02,856 --> 00:05:05,140
Are we gonna be doing a laparotomy?

92
00:05:06,609 --> 00:05:08,844
We need intra-operative staging
for the biopsy,

93
00:05:08,846 --> 00:05:10,913
extensive dissection
of the retroperitoneum,

94
00:05:10,915 --> 00:05:13,439
and excision of the mass
with wide, clear margins.

95
00:05:14,612 --> 00:05:15,745
I want in.

96
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:16,952
You do know you're drooling, right?

97
00:05:16,954 --> 00:05:18,954
About cutting open a 40-year-old woman.

98
00:05:18,956 --> 00:05:20,588
Real person. Right behind that door.

99
00:05:20,613 --> 00:05:21,744
It's called bedside manner...

100
00:05:21,769 --> 00:05:23,392
no such thing as
outside-the-door manner.

101
00:05:23,394 --> 00:05:25,088
It is exciting, Claire.

102
00:05:25,113 --> 00:05:27,329
We'd be saving a life,
and we'd be learning.

103
00:05:27,331 --> 00:05:28,561
See?

104
00:05:28,586 --> 00:05:30,632
Dr. Browne, you're my number two.

105
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:34,136
- With all due respect, doctor...
- Comments that start that way

106
00:05:34,138 --> 00:05:35,637
rarely come across that way.

107
00:05:35,983 --> 00:05:38,741
- I was gonna say that's an excellent call.
- Thank you.

108
00:05:38,743 --> 00:05:41,477
- Jared, prep the surgical team.
- Sir, what do I do?

109
00:05:44,547 --> 00:05:46,912
- Scut work.
- What's scut work?

110
00:05:46,974 --> 00:05:49,824
Today, I'm gonna need my surgeons
to have no distractions.

111
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,389
So I'm gonna need you
to handle those distractions.

112
00:05:52,523 --> 00:05:54,356
All the work they do every day

113
00:05:54,358 --> 00:05:55,322
that they hate doing,

114
00:05:55,507 --> 00:05:57,282
you're handling it for them.

115
00:06:07,037 --> 00:06:09,304
Make sure they know we
still need a consent on that one.

116
00:06:15,245 --> 00:06:16,512
Am I being punished for something?

117
00:06:16,682 --> 00:06:18,313
No.

118
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:20,349
Okay.

119
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:22,751
So that's it?

120
00:06:22,909 --> 00:06:25,354
You just accept my answer at face value?

121
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:26,889
Why?

122
00:06:27,273 --> 00:06:29,506
You're very arrogant.

123
00:06:30,148 --> 00:06:32,249
Arrogant people don't think
they need to lie.

124
00:06:32,587 --> 00:06:34,954
So you must be doing this to teach me.

125
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,074
I look forward to learning
from scut work.

126
00:06:41,955 --> 00:06:45,050
- Say "Ahh."
- Ahhh.

127
00:06:45,075 --> 00:06:46,408
How long will this be?

128
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:48,231
Seven minutes.

129
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:51,254
Without any complications,
it takes seven minutes

130
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:53,415
to do a discharge examination properly.

131
00:06:53,417 --> 00:06:55,456
Dr. Dunsmuir
has already cleared him to go

132
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:57,019
- and we need the bed.
- Okay.

133
00:06:57,021 --> 00:06:59,409
Protocol requires that
the surgical department

134
00:06:59,434 --> 00:07:00,856
also clears him.

135
00:07:03,426 --> 00:07:05,143
You have an ear infection.

136
00:07:05,168 --> 00:07:06,595
Yes, that's why he's here.

137
00:07:06,597 --> 00:07:08,297
My hearing's been a little muffled,

138
00:07:08,299 --> 00:07:09,765
and I've had some ringing.

139
00:07:09,767 --> 00:07:11,102
They gave him amoxicillin.

140
00:07:11,127 --> 00:07:12,734
And we're sending him home.

141
00:07:12,736 --> 00:07:14,136
Which is why you're here.

142
00:07:14,138 --> 00:07:16,070
To send him home.

143
00:07:16,095 --> 00:07:17,223
I'd like an MRI

144
00:07:17,248 --> 00:07:19,208
of the head
and internal auditory meatus.

145
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:20,576
I'm not being discharged?

146
00:07:20,578 --> 00:07:22,077
What do you think is wrong?

147
00:07:24,548 --> 00:07:26,472
I'll tell you when I know for sure.

148
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,484
I don't want to scare you.

149
00:07:40,206 --> 00:07:41,538
Shaun.

150
00:07:41,665 --> 00:07:42,898
What are you doing down here?

151
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,234
I'm waiting for her to fart.

152
00:07:47,638 --> 00:07:48,871
Flatulence.

153
00:07:48,873 --> 00:07:50,857
But I'm using the word "fart"
in front of the patient

154
00:07:50,882 --> 00:07:52,090
to be more casual.

155
00:07:52,115 --> 00:07:53,677
But you're the president
of the hospital,

156
00:07:53,702 --> 00:07:54,977
so I'll say "flatulence" to you.

157
00:07:55,847 --> 00:07:57,348
Well, I appreciate that.

158
00:07:57,421 --> 00:07:59,287
Why are you doing that?

159
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,374
She had her deviated septum repaired.

160
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:02,491
Before we can release her,

161
00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:03,785
we have to be sure she isn't suffering

162
00:08:03,787 --> 00:08:05,053
from post-operative ileus.

163
00:08:05,055 --> 00:08:06,922
Ah.

164
00:08:08,222 --> 00:08:10,456
This is what Dr. Melendez feels

165
00:08:10,481 --> 00:08:12,928
you'll be most useful doing today?

166
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,566
Waiting for farts?

167
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:17,199
- I'm not just waiting for farts.
- Thank goodness.

168
00:08:17,201 --> 00:08:18,934
I'm doing all the scut work.

169
00:08:20,961 --> 00:08:23,125
Well...

170
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:25,417
Welcome to your surgical residency.

171
00:08:27,778 --> 00:08:28,810
Thank you.

172
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:33,757
There. I think that was it.

173
00:08:37,876 --> 00:08:39,776
I don't think so.

174
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:41,812
I'll wait a little longer.

175
00:08:41,882 --> 00:08:43,225
This is important.

176
00:08:46,564 --> 00:08:49,671
The procedure is called a laparotomy.

177
00:08:49,877 --> 00:08:51,968
Mm.

178
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:55,366
Yeah, your heart sounds good.

179
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:58,257
So, we make a long incision
down the middle of your abdomen,

180
00:08:58,342 --> 00:09:00,442
- expose the tumor...
- Am I going to die?

181
00:09:03,146 --> 00:09:06,514
Dr. Melendez is the best surgeon
I have ever seen...

182
00:09:06,539 --> 00:09:08,772
Can this all wait?

183
00:09:08,796 --> 00:09:11,001
You have a very serious condition.
It's not advisable to...

184
00:09:11,026 --> 00:09:14,681
Just a couple of weeks.
My son is getting married next weekend.

185
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,189
They look very happy.

186
00:09:17,394 --> 00:09:19,161
After the initial incision...

187
00:09:19,163 --> 00:09:21,463
They've been planning this for months.

188
00:09:21,465 --> 00:09:22,698
If they have to reschedule...

189
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,356
Well... well, this...
this is complicated surgery,

190
00:09:25,381 --> 00:09:26,902
but if all goes well,

191
00:09:26,904 --> 00:09:28,370
recovery is pretty easy.

192
00:09:28,372 --> 00:09:31,057
No need to reschedule anything.

193
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:32,741
And if it doesn't?

194
00:09:33,026 --> 00:09:34,843
If it doesn't go well?

195
00:09:39,316 --> 00:09:41,290
My husband died in a car accident

196
00:09:41,385 --> 00:09:43,227
a couple of years ago.

197
00:09:44,388 --> 00:09:46,735
Mark is our only child.

198
00:09:47,891 --> 00:09:49,958
I can't die right before his wedding.

199
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,893
I can't.

200
00:09:53,707 --> 00:09:55,778
You're not gonna die.

201
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:57,929
You will be at the wedding.

202
00:09:58,016 --> 00:09:59,081
Looking beautiful.

203
00:10:09,213 --> 00:10:11,546
You're not supposed to make
promises like that, Dr. Browne.

204
00:10:11,548 --> 00:10:13,515
Yeah, I told her
what she needed to hear.

205
00:10:13,517 --> 00:10:16,002
Officially, our legal
department's policy is...

206
00:10:16,027 --> 00:10:18,416
tell the ugly truth...
the uglier the better.

207
00:10:18,441 --> 00:10:20,147
Is that what you did?
I don't think that's what you did.

208
00:10:20,172 --> 00:10:21,671
Yeah, well, it's a dumb policy.

209
00:10:21,702 --> 00:10:23,069
She needs to have the surgery.

210
00:10:23,094 --> 00:10:24,514
Scaring her would change nothing.

211
00:10:24,539 --> 00:10:25,940
Right, because a much better policy

212
00:10:25,972 --> 00:10:27,455
would be to lie to all of our patients

213
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:28,664
whenever it makes you feel better.

214
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:30,049
No, it doesn't make <i>me</i> feel better.

215
00:10:30,074 --> 00:10:31,600
It makes <i>her</i> feel better.

216
00:10:34,795 --> 00:10:35,978
I'm pathetic.

217
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:40,216
- What?
- I am pathetic.

218
00:10:40,286 --> 00:10:42,044
And here's my thinking, so just...

219
00:10:42,069 --> 00:10:45,450
just bear with me, because
it kind of insults both of us.

220
00:10:46,193 --> 00:10:48,750
You met that woman an hour ago,
and you lied to her.

221
00:10:48,752 --> 00:10:51,720
A pity lie because you
obviously care about her.

222
00:10:51,722 --> 00:10:55,557
A pity lie that has absolutely
zero upside for you,

223
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:57,673
but I can't make you,
the world's softest touch,

224
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:59,561
care about me.

225
00:11:09,807 --> 00:11:11,773
Hey.

226
00:11:16,847 --> 00:11:19,243
I need a consult.

227
00:11:19,837 --> 00:11:22,070
What? You have a question about this?

228
00:11:22,157 --> 00:11:23,819
This patient is perfectly healthy.

229
00:11:23,821 --> 00:11:25,357
There's not even any artifact
in these images.

230
00:11:25,382 --> 00:11:28,457
Yeah, which in turn raises an
interesting medical question...

231
00:11:28,459 --> 00:11:31,271
why the hell did this patient
get an MRI?

232
00:11:31,595 --> 00:11:33,161
I don't know anything about this.

233
00:11:33,163 --> 00:11:35,056
Yeah. Someone on your team ordered it.

234
00:11:35,081 --> 00:11:37,265
It's your responsibility,
which makes it your fault.

235
00:11:38,602 --> 00:11:39,901
What... How did you...?

236
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:42,337
It's my department.
It's my job to know everything.

237
00:11:42,339 --> 00:11:44,585
Well, then, since I work for you,

238
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:46,408
doesn't that make all of this
actually your fault?

239
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:49,352
Oh, I'm sorry, I stopped listening
after "I work for you."

240
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:54,950
Does that hurt?

241
00:11:54,952 --> 00:11:56,017
Yes.

242
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,220
Does that hurt?

243
00:11:58,325 --> 00:11:59,848
Yes.

244
00:12:00,224 --> 00:12:01,423
Does that hurt?

245
00:12:01,425 --> 00:12:03,620
How much are we paying for this?
She has a tummy ache.

246
00:12:03,645 --> 00:12:04,960
- That's what they do... they ache.
- Shh.

247
00:12:04,962 --> 00:12:07,001
She's just trying to get
out of school. Again.

248
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:08,497
Where do you think
she learned that from?

249
00:12:08,522 --> 00:12:10,198
You don't think she hears you
calling in sick to work

250
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,366
right before you go golfing?

251
00:12:11,368 --> 00:12:13,168
I like school.

252
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,586
Me too.

253
00:12:14,611 --> 00:12:16,271
What did you eat for dinner last night?

254
00:12:16,273 --> 00:12:18,039
Cereal.

255
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:19,341
- I thought you made meatloaf.
- I did.

256
00:12:19,343 --> 00:12:21,209
And it got cold while
we were waiting for you.

257
00:12:21,211 --> 00:12:23,533
I want D-dimer, lactate, and amylase...

258
00:12:23,558 --> 00:12:24,846
What tests are you ordering?

259
00:12:24,848 --> 00:12:27,849
D-dimer, lactate, and amylase.

260
00:12:27,874 --> 00:12:30,445
- For a tummy ache? Hmm?
- Yes.

261
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:32,849
I'm concerned it may be...

262
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:37,488
Shall we talk outside?

263
00:12:37,513 --> 00:12:38,900
I told you something was wrong.

264
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:40,595
You're happy she might be sick?

265
00:12:40,597 --> 00:12:41,663
I'm happy you're wrong.

266
00:12:41,665 --> 00:12:43,431
Yeah. Let's talk outside.

267
00:12:46,429 --> 00:12:48,584
Have they been bickering
like that the whole time?

268
00:12:48,668 --> 00:12:51,209
I didn't notice. They aren't sick.

269
00:12:51,256 --> 00:12:53,436
- Yeah, they're what we call a vector.
- Hmm?

270
00:12:53,461 --> 00:12:55,677
A carrier. A cause of disease.

271
00:12:55,764 --> 00:12:57,712
- You mean the parents?
- Yeah.

272
00:12:57,714 --> 00:12:59,314
That little girl has a tummy ache

273
00:12:59,316 --> 00:13:01,116
because mommy and daddy
won't stop fighting.

274
00:13:01,118 --> 00:13:02,984
This isn't a medical issue.
Send them home.

275
00:13:03,009 --> 00:13:04,653
Could be intestinal malrotation,

276
00:13:04,655 --> 00:13:06,154
which could quickly become fatal.

277
00:13:06,156 --> 00:13:08,423
And every patient in this
hospital could have malaria,

278
00:13:08,425 --> 00:13:10,358
but that doesn't mean
we're gonna go around testing

279
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,027
for every condition
we think they could have.

280
00:13:12,029 --> 00:13:13,628
For example, that MRI you ordered

281
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:15,330
on the guy with the ear infection?

282
00:13:15,332 --> 00:13:16,464
Nice call, genius.

283
00:13:16,466 --> 00:13:18,099
Thank you.

284
00:13:18,101 --> 00:13:19,301
I was being sarcastic.

285
00:13:19,303 --> 00:13:21,736
It's normal. He's healthy.
Send him home, too.

286
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,006
Why are you smiling?

287
00:13:25,008 --> 00:13:26,141
Because you're right.

288
00:13:26,767 --> 00:13:28,160
So you thought he was making a mistake

289
00:13:28,185 --> 00:13:29,546
and didn't say anything?

290
00:13:29,571 --> 00:13:31,751
Just stood by watching, taking notes

291
00:13:31,776 --> 00:13:33,470
while he wasted everybody's time?

292
00:13:33,495 --> 00:13:34,816
Is that your job?

293
00:13:35,251 --> 00:13:37,664
In my experience,
doctors don't listen to nurses.

294
00:13:37,689 --> 00:13:39,265
And they only talk to us to lecture us

295
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:40,889
when they figure
we screwed something up.

296
00:13:46,263 --> 00:13:47,495
From now on, you don't run any tests

297
00:13:47,497 --> 00:13:48,463
you don't have to run.

298
00:13:48,465 --> 00:13:50,265
How do I know if a test is needed

299
00:13:50,267 --> 00:13:51,433
until after I run it?

300
00:13:52,536 --> 00:13:53,902
She'll tell you.

301
00:13:53,904 --> 00:13:56,071
Today, she's your boss.

302
00:14:11,646 --> 00:14:13,950
I could never eat before surgery.

303
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:17,066
Puke? I could do that.

304
00:14:17,301 --> 00:14:18,901
I get cranky if I don't eat.

305
00:14:20,482 --> 00:14:22,522
- I hear Shaun made the call.
- Mm.

306
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,393
He's an excellent diagnostician.

307
00:14:24,395 --> 00:14:26,395
You should get him a job in radiology.

308
00:14:26,397 --> 00:14:28,264
He doesn't want to be a radiologist.

309
00:14:28,266 --> 00:14:29,786
He wants to be a surgeon.

310
00:14:29,811 --> 00:14:31,645
That's what we hired him to be.

311
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:34,937
That's what I worked damn hard
to hire him to be.

312
00:14:34,939 --> 00:14:36,639
Not a glorified orderly.

313
00:14:36,641 --> 00:14:38,370
Every resident does scut work.

314
00:14:38,395 --> 00:14:40,576
So you're treating him
like anybody else?

315
00:14:40,578 --> 00:14:42,578
- Are you?
- Yes, yes, I am.

316
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,613
He more than earned the right
to be here.

317
00:14:44,615 --> 00:14:46,582
He has had to get past people like you

318
00:14:46,584 --> 00:14:48,651
and their prejudices
every step of the way.

319
00:14:48,653 --> 00:14:50,841
- Prejudices?
- Yeah, prejudices.

320
00:14:50,866 --> 00:14:52,521
You have any idea how many patients

321
00:14:52,523 --> 00:14:53,923
he's scared the crap out of today?

322
00:14:53,925 --> 00:14:56,025
How many wasted tests he ordered?

323
00:14:56,027 --> 00:14:57,193
So teach him.

324
00:14:57,195 --> 00:14:58,458
I'm doing that.

325
00:14:58,629 --> 00:15:01,177
I'm teaching you both
that he doesn't belong.

326
00:15:02,867 --> 00:15:04,166
Okay.

327
00:15:04,168 --> 00:15:07,232
You're gonna make me pull rank,
I will pull rank.

328
00:15:07,427 --> 00:15:09,222
This is my hospital.

329
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,401
But it's my team.

330
00:15:11,881 --> 00:15:13,514
You can't tell me how to run my team.

331
00:15:23,572 --> 00:15:25,305
Hey.

332
00:15:25,456 --> 00:15:26,822
How are you doing?

333
00:15:26,824 --> 00:15:28,724
What's the point of sarcasm?

334
00:15:29,187 --> 00:15:30,826
Um...

335
00:15:31,294 --> 00:15:32,495
Well, uh...

336
00:15:32,497 --> 00:15:36,437
Like, sometimes,
it's a way of critiquing people

337
00:15:36,462 --> 00:15:38,134
in a way that's funny

338
00:15:38,136 --> 00:15:39,702
so they don't feel quite so bad.

339
00:15:39,704 --> 00:15:41,203
Isn't it just lying?

340
00:15:41,205 --> 00:15:42,905
Mm, well, it's not lying,

341
00:15:42,907 --> 00:15:44,940
because people know you're lying.

342
00:15:45,621 --> 00:15:47,799
I'm not good at that.

343
00:15:48,979 --> 00:15:51,080
<i>You may remember me from last year.</i>

344
00:15:51,082 --> 00:15:52,715
We sell chocolate bars every year

345
00:15:52,717 --> 00:15:54,750
to pay for our class trip
to Mt. Rushmore.

346
00:15:54,752 --> 00:15:56,118
Okay.

347
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,953
But this year we're not
going to Mt. Rushmore,

348
00:15:57,955 --> 00:16:00,356
because Kenny can't go.

349
00:16:00,358 --> 00:16:01,791
He's got cancer.

350
00:16:02,674 --> 00:16:04,478
So, Samantha had the idea

351
00:16:04,503 --> 00:16:06,595
that if he can't go,
none of us would go,

352
00:16:06,597 --> 00:16:08,397
and we all thought
that was a great idea.

353
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,766
So, we're gonna have a party
at the hospital for him.

354
00:16:12,602 --> 00:16:14,376
There are two Kennys in your class.

355
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:16,227
Is it Kenny L. or Kenny M.?

356
00:16:16,252 --> 00:16:18,018
No one's sick.

357
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:19,242
Well, you lied?

358
00:16:19,343 --> 00:16:21,076
- You weren't supposed to lie.
- Yeah.

359
00:16:21,078 --> 00:16:22,925
And you and me aren't
supposed to starve.

360
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:24,216
We need money for food.

361
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,893
Was any of that true?

362
00:16:26,918 --> 00:16:28,417
Yeah.

363
00:16:28,419 --> 00:16:29,952
We're not going to Mt. Rushmore.

364
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:37,359
I can't discharge people

365
00:16:37,361 --> 00:16:39,128
if I think they might still be sick.

366
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:41,597
Um, of course not. Why would you?

367
00:16:41,599 --> 00:16:44,600
Dr. Melendez made Nurse Fryday
my boss today.

368
00:16:45,053 --> 00:16:47,369
Should I speak to Dr. Glassman?

369
00:16:47,421 --> 00:16:49,225
No.

370
00:16:49,545 --> 00:16:51,645
What did you think this job was?

371
00:16:51,709 --> 00:16:53,286
To save people's lives.

372
00:16:53,311 --> 00:16:54,376
No.

373
00:16:54,378 --> 00:16:57,893
I mean, yeah,
sometimes we do save lives.

374
00:16:57,982 --> 00:16:59,963
But the job...

375
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:02,484
It's doing whatever
Melendez asks us to do.

376
00:17:03,955 --> 00:17:05,629
<i>Paging Dr. Browne.</i>

377
00:17:05,684 --> 00:17:08,434
<i>Paging Dr. Browne to the O.R.</i>

378
00:17:16,395 --> 00:17:17,867
I'm Dr. Claire Browne.

379
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:18,901
I'm first assist today,

380
00:17:18,926 --> 00:17:20,591
and I'll be leading the timeout.

381
00:17:20,616 --> 00:17:23,550
- Patient's name?
- Stephanie Willis.

382
00:17:23,808 --> 00:17:25,107
Scheduled surgery?

383
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:27,509
Excision of an indeterminate
retroperitoneal tumor.

384
00:17:27,511 --> 00:17:30,754
We don't anticipate any
complications with the surgery.

385
00:17:30,779 --> 00:17:32,579
Thank you, Dr. Browne.

386
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,830
- Ten blade.
- Ten blade.

387
00:17:43,961 --> 00:17:45,361
Let's remove a tumor.

388
00:17:49,367 --> 00:17:50,633
Excuse me.

389
00:17:54,877 --> 00:17:55,980
No.

390
00:17:58,276 --> 00:17:59,742
It might be infected.

391
00:17:59,744 --> 00:18:02,153
- It's not.
- There is some discoloration.

392
00:18:02,178 --> 00:18:04,947
He's 82 years old.
Everything is discolored.

393
00:18:12,263 --> 00:18:14,790
Once we get through the muscle layer,
proceed carefully.

394
00:18:15,216 --> 00:18:17,747
Blood pressure, 120 over 70.

395
00:18:17,795 --> 00:18:18,894
Heart rate 60.

396
00:18:18,896 --> 00:18:20,195
She's holding steady.

397
00:18:21,629 --> 00:18:23,229
I've opened the facia.

398
00:18:25,179 --> 00:18:27,480
You kept your puke?

399
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:30,372
Yeah, I thought you'd want to see it.

400
00:18:30,374 --> 00:18:33,208
It looks like puke.

401
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:35,377
No. No, no. It's not the regular color.

402
00:18:35,922 --> 00:18:37,546
Your puke has a regular color?

403
00:18:37,548 --> 00:18:38,614
Yeah.

404
00:18:38,616 --> 00:18:40,449
It is a bit of an unusual color.

405
00:18:40,944 --> 00:18:42,999
We could order some...

406
00:18:44,577 --> 00:18:46,499
I'm sending you home.

407
00:18:46,648 --> 00:18:48,615
You sure?

408
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:50,392
It... It's safe for me to go home?

409
00:18:52,276 --> 00:18:53,476
<i>I don't know what to say.</i>

410
00:18:53,813 --> 00:18:55,461
You'll learn.

411
00:18:55,586 --> 00:18:56,832
By doing.

412
00:19:04,954 --> 00:19:06,288
Hi.

413
00:19:09,502 --> 00:19:11,580
My brother said
there's a kid named Kenny,

414
00:19:11,605 --> 00:19:13,349
and he's sick, and there might...

415
00:19:13,351 --> 00:19:14,450
you should give us money.

416
00:19:17,989 --> 00:19:19,221
So, am I okay?

417
00:19:21,413 --> 00:19:23,080
Am... Am I okay?

418
00:19:23,536 --> 00:19:25,510
According to all hospital rules

419
00:19:25,535 --> 00:19:27,997
and direct instructions
given to me, yes.

420
00:19:32,597 --> 00:19:33,886
But...

421
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:38,941
Whoa.

422
00:19:38,943 --> 00:19:41,592
We need a better exposure of this tumor.

423
00:19:44,701 --> 00:19:46,383
Let's get the deep Balfour in here.

424
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,225
Deep Balfour retractor.

425
00:19:50,254 --> 00:19:52,988
Let's get this thing open.
I've got to see where it's safe to cut.

426
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,667
Yeah. Thanks.

427
00:19:56,013 --> 00:19:58,861
I can't see anywhere where this
tumor hasn't encased her arteries.

428
00:19:58,863 --> 00:20:00,219
Claire, tell me you got something.

429
00:20:00,244 --> 00:20:01,497
I've got nothing.

430
00:20:01,499 --> 00:20:03,966
This tumor is way bigger
than it looked on the scans.

431
00:20:06,508 --> 00:20:10,106
I... I can't even see her aorta.

432
00:20:11,342 --> 00:20:12,908
That's a problem.

433
00:20:38,688 --> 00:20:41,382
Is that the girl
with the bickering parents?

434
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:44,062
Didn't we send her home four hours ago?

435
00:20:46,689 --> 00:20:49,112
Dr. Murphy,
Dr. Melendez needs you in surgery.

436
00:20:56,354 --> 00:20:58,421
That won't be necessary.

437
00:21:05,141 --> 00:21:08,239
The tumor's entirely encased
the large abdominal arteries.

438
00:21:08,264 --> 00:21:09,420
That's very bad.

439
00:21:09,445 --> 00:21:10,709
If it's in the artery walls,

440
00:21:10,734 --> 00:21:13,478
it's going to be impossible
to cut out without killing her.

441
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,080
You should get a biopsy to determine
where the margins are.

442
00:21:16,118 --> 00:21:17,751
Thank you.

443
00:21:17,977 --> 00:21:19,420
You're welcome.

444
00:21:19,422 --> 00:21:21,522
I was being sarcastic... again.

445
00:21:22,148 --> 00:21:23,791
Oh, I-I see,

446
00:21:23,793 --> 00:21:25,726
because you are already know
everything I said,

447
00:21:25,728 --> 00:21:27,945
and you already sent a biopsy
to the lab?

448
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:29,997
Yes, 'cause I'm a doctor, too.

449
00:21:30,195 --> 00:21:32,329
Yes. But you need me?

450
00:21:32,354 --> 00:21:33,930
Yeah, I need you to run down to the lab

451
00:21:33,955 --> 00:21:35,454
and hurry them along.

452
00:21:51,554 --> 00:21:53,261
I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.

453
00:21:53,286 --> 00:21:54,886
I'm a surgical resident.

454
00:21:54,911 --> 00:21:56,657
Dr. Melendez sent you a biopsy.

455
00:21:56,659 --> 00:21:58,292
When will the results be ready?

456
00:21:58,294 --> 00:21:59,760
When I get to it.

457
00:21:59,762 --> 00:22:01,462
It's very important.

458
00:22:01,464 --> 00:22:02,896
They're all very important.

459
00:22:04,503 --> 00:22:06,455
Let me see the other test orders.

460
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,302
I'll tell you which ones
are most important,

461
00:22:08,304 --> 00:22:10,037
and you can do them in that order.

462
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:11,672
I'll be honest and fair.

463
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:14,942
That is not the way that it works.

464
00:22:15,097 --> 00:22:16,765
Now go wait your turn.

465
00:22:21,216 --> 00:22:22,483
<i>Do it again.</i>

466
00:22:31,652 --> 00:22:35,011
- Get the hell away from me, you moron.
- Let's get out of here!

467
00:22:37,199 --> 00:22:38,565
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

468
00:22:40,101 --> 00:22:42,180
If you want to get
anything in life, Shaun,

469
00:22:42,205 --> 00:22:43,637
there's one thing you got to do.

470
00:22:43,639 --> 00:22:45,205
Never be afraid.

471
00:22:47,042 --> 00:22:48,142
You're the moron!

472
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:08,595
If you don't do
Dr. Melendez's test right now,

473
00:23:08,597 --> 00:23:10,497
I will throw a rock through your window.

474
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:18,197
Well, I wouldn't want that.

475
00:23:20,609 --> 00:23:22,104
Go have a seat.

476
00:23:22,239 --> 00:23:24,393
Your results will be ready
in 15 minutes.

477
00:23:35,124 --> 00:23:36,523
You got a minute?

478
00:23:36,525 --> 00:23:38,412
I have a patient lying in the O.R.

479
00:23:38,437 --> 00:23:39,870
waiting for lab results,

480
00:23:39,895 --> 00:23:41,361
and I'm sitting here
trying to figure out

481
00:23:41,363 --> 00:23:43,564
what the hell I'm gonna do next,
and I don't like any of my options,

482
00:23:43,566 --> 00:23:46,592
so... yeah, unfortunately it seems I do.

483
00:23:46,802 --> 00:23:48,402
Okay, we can talk another time.

484
00:23:48,404 --> 00:23:49,603
Glassman talked to you?

485
00:23:51,857 --> 00:23:54,408
I don't have a problem
with an autistic doctor.

486
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:56,404
No, you just have a problem
with one working for you.

487
00:23:56,429 --> 00:23:57,978
Really? That's how you see me?

488
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,717
Let's not make this personal.

489
00:23:59,742 --> 00:24:01,909
You're accusing me of prejudice.

490
00:24:02,084 --> 00:24:03,750
I have a problem with the doctor

491
00:24:03,752 --> 00:24:05,652
who has a problem with communication.

492
00:24:05,654 --> 00:24:09,690
Okay, let's make this personal.

493
00:24:11,627 --> 00:24:12,993
Who do you respect at this hospital?

494
00:24:12,995 --> 00:24:15,893
You and Glassman.

495
00:24:16,074 --> 00:24:17,840
And who do you not respect?

496
00:24:21,391 --> 00:24:23,058
And does it bother you

497
00:24:23,138 --> 00:24:25,339
that it looks like
you're on the wrong team?

498
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,778
If the tumor hasn't invaded
into the arterial walls,

499
00:24:29,803 --> 00:24:31,536
we could create a plane of dissection.

500
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,785
Well, if it's a noninvasive liposarcoma

501
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:35,415
we can work it off from the outside.

502
00:24:35,417 --> 00:24:37,217
Blunt dissection and tissue forceps...

503
00:24:37,219 --> 00:24:38,619
peel it off piece by piece.

504
00:24:48,474 --> 00:24:51,086
It's a leiomyosarcoma.

505
00:24:52,568 --> 00:24:54,901
Well, that sucks.

506
00:24:54,903 --> 00:24:57,070
- Yes, it's sad.
- The surgery's impossible.

507
00:24:57,414 --> 00:25:00,546
Well, might as well wake her up...

508
00:25:00,719 --> 00:25:02,919
let her know she has
three months to live,

509
00:25:02,999 --> 00:25:04,832
offer palliative care.

510
00:25:11,181 --> 00:25:13,582
The surgery isn't impossible...

511
00:25:13,789 --> 00:25:16,714
just, very, very, very difficult.

512
00:25:16,792 --> 00:25:19,293
Yes, in the sense
that we'll be operating blind.

513
00:25:19,295 --> 00:25:21,828
Yes, because the left kidney
is in the way.

514
00:25:21,909 --> 00:25:25,229
- The healthy left kidney.
- Both kidneys are healthy, Jared.

515
00:25:25,254 --> 00:25:26,300
She only needs one.

516
00:25:26,325 --> 00:25:28,368
Without the left one,
it's theoretically possible

517
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:30,070
to access the tumor and remove it.

518
00:25:30,072 --> 00:25:32,239
You're suggesting we cut out
a perfectly healthy organ

519
00:25:32,241 --> 00:25:33,745
- just to get a better view?
- Yes.

520
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:36,628
- But she might die anyway.
- Yes. Quite probably.

521
00:25:38,179 --> 00:25:40,614
I have to go. I have a boil to lance.

522
00:25:44,025 --> 00:25:46,527
I mean, it's a brilliant...

523
00:25:47,174 --> 00:25:49,175
very, very, very terrible idea.

524
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:54,184
Close her up and wake her up.

525
00:25:54,296 --> 00:25:55,520
Who wants to join me when I tell her

526
00:25:55,545 --> 00:25:57,097
she has six weeks left to live?

527
00:25:59,801 --> 00:26:02,069
There is one possibility.

528
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,139
If we removed the left kidney,

529
00:26:06,141 --> 00:26:07,574
we might be able to get
a good enough view

530
00:26:07,576 --> 00:26:09,236
to successfully remove the mass.

531
00:26:09,261 --> 00:26:11,035
Take out a healthy kidney

532
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,479
to get a better view?

533
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:14,184
That's insane.

534
00:26:14,515 --> 00:26:17,184
A good view's half the battle
in any operation.

535
00:26:18,403 --> 00:26:20,620
Most likely outcome
is we'd be depriving her

536
00:26:20,622 --> 00:26:21,922
of what little time she has left.

537
00:26:21,924 --> 00:26:23,993
But if we succeed...

538
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,593
You want to do this
'cause it's exciting.

539
00:26:26,595 --> 00:26:27,961
You want to be a hero.

540
00:26:27,963 --> 00:26:30,531
But if you fail, this woman dies.

541
00:26:30,556 --> 00:26:31,932
She misses her son's wedding.

542
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:34,868
Well, that's the issue, isn't it?

543
00:26:36,172 --> 00:26:38,508
You promised this woman she'll be okay.

544
00:26:46,778 --> 00:26:48,310
She had to do this surgery.

545
00:26:48,335 --> 00:26:50,150
I might as well tell her good things.

546
00:26:50,152 --> 00:26:52,287
The reason we don't make
patients promises

547
00:26:52,312 --> 00:26:53,670
isn't just for legal.

548
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:56,046
Jared's right.
Your judgment is compromised.

549
00:26:56,071 --> 00:26:57,758
- I still think...
- You're not objective.

550
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,792
Who the hell is?

551
00:27:00,072 --> 00:27:02,439
We should at least wake her up,

552
00:27:02,626 --> 00:27:05,624
explain what we found,
what we're hoping to do,

553
00:27:05,734 --> 00:27:08,201
- and get a new consent.
- What we're hoping to do

554
00:27:08,203 --> 00:27:10,437
is exactly what you told her
we were going to do...

555
00:27:10,494 --> 00:27:11,838
remove that tumor.

556
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,218
The only thing we'd be explaining is

557
00:27:13,243 --> 00:27:14,608
why you undersold the risks.

558
00:27:15,972 --> 00:27:18,106
We're doing the surgery.

559
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,388
And, Jared, you're my new number two.

560
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:36,121
- Mayos.
- Mayos.

561
00:27:39,285 --> 00:27:41,991
I'm going to open the fascia
and expose the kidney.

562
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:43,493
You clamp the renal hilum.

563
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,226
- Clamp.
- Clamp.

564
00:27:51,903 --> 00:27:53,589
We just cut off the blood supply

565
00:27:53,614 --> 00:27:55,261
to a perfectly healthy kidney.

566
00:27:55,286 --> 00:27:57,964
If we needed color commentary,
I would have hired Jeff Van Gundy.

567
00:28:05,712 --> 00:28:08,313
Shaun, I believe you've met Trevor.

568
00:28:08,487 --> 00:28:10,286
Yes. I sent him home.

569
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:12,964
Yes, well, he didn't go home.

570
00:28:12,989 --> 00:28:14,432
He actually came to

571
00:28:14,457 --> 00:28:17,043
the president of the hospital instead.

572
00:28:17,068 --> 00:28:18,418
H-He said you sent him home

573
00:28:18,443 --> 00:28:19,520
even though you thought he was sick.

574
00:28:19,598 --> 00:28:21,197
I specifically never said that.

575
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,832
- I made sure not to say that.
- No. Oh.

576
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:24,267
What... what the hell does that mean?

577
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:26,136
- What does that mean, Shaun?
- A-Am I healthy?

578
00:28:26,138 --> 00:28:27,504
- Probably.
- You're a doctor.

579
00:28:27,506 --> 00:28:29,210
- You're... you're supposed to know.
- No, we're not...

580
00:28:29,257 --> 00:28:30,975
Nobody knows anything for sure.

581
00:28:31,038 --> 00:28:33,436
Anybody could drop dead of
a heart attack at any time.

582
00:28:33,499 --> 00:28:34,678
Who is this guy?

583
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:36,694
Am I... Am I gonna have a heart attack?

584
00:28:37,398 --> 00:28:39,899
Shaun has some difficulty

585
00:28:39,901 --> 00:28:42,368
with certain social interactions,
but if he says that...

586
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:43,669
I don't give a crap what he says.

587
00:28:43,671 --> 00:28:46,272
W-What do you say? Am I healthy?

588
00:28:47,341 --> 00:28:49,498
I've reviewed your chart,

589
00:28:49,592 --> 00:28:51,303
and I can say with complete confidence

590
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:53,579
that you are in peak physical condition.

591
00:28:53,581 --> 00:28:55,381
Thank God.

592
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:09,006
Shaun, people need reassurance.

593
00:29:09,197 --> 00:29:11,330
I told him he was safe to go home.

594
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:13,599
- I was very clear.
- W-With your words...

595
00:29:13,601 --> 00:29:15,434
Your actions said something
completely different.

596
00:29:15,436 --> 00:29:18,270
No, they didn't.
My actions were completely silent.

597
00:29:19,205 --> 00:29:22,975
When you reassure someone,
they have to receive it.

598
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,510
You have to gauge

599
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:27,178
whether they actually are reassured.

600
00:29:27,315 --> 00:29:28,447
You understand?

601
00:29:30,576 --> 00:29:32,485
When did you review Trevor's chart?

602
00:29:33,653 --> 00:29:34,687
I didn't.

603
00:29:35,743 --> 00:29:37,077
It's not really a lie.

604
00:29:37,102 --> 00:29:39,302
If you say that he is safe to go home,

605
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,027
then I know for a fact
that he's safe to go home.

606
00:29:44,165 --> 00:29:46,265
I sent a girl home today.

607
00:29:48,702 --> 00:29:50,736
How often do people
develop stomach issues

608
00:29:50,738 --> 00:29:51,871
because of their brain?

609
00:29:52,089 --> 00:29:54,300
Based on my personal experience?

610
00:29:54,331 --> 00:29:55,808
Every single day.

611
00:29:58,198 --> 00:30:00,479
I want D-dimer, lactate, and amylase

612
00:30:00,481 --> 00:30:02,548
for a 10-year-old girl, Martine LaDuff.

613
00:30:02,714 --> 00:30:05,417
She might have a tummy ache
caused by stress.

614
00:30:05,628 --> 00:30:07,353
Or she might not.

615
00:30:08,021 --> 00:30:09,021
Hi, Shaun.

616
00:30:09,023 --> 00:30:10,560
Hi, Carly.

617
00:30:10,585 --> 00:30:13,053
That's a lot of tests
for an upset stomach.

618
00:30:13,161 --> 00:30:14,393
You could get in trouble.

619
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:16,061
That's definitely true.

620
00:30:18,699 --> 00:30:21,675
- Remove the kidney.
- All right.

621
00:30:32,996 --> 00:30:34,651
Let's get in there
with some suction, Claire,

622
00:30:34,676 --> 00:30:36,692
so we can get a better view
of what we're dealing with.

623
00:30:42,123 --> 00:30:43,155
There it is.

624
00:30:45,959 --> 00:30:47,960
It's a mess.

625
00:30:48,067 --> 00:30:50,012
Yes, it is.

626
00:30:50,131 --> 00:30:52,665
But now it's a mess we can see.

627
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:56,032
Everything is within normal range.

628
00:30:56,642 --> 00:30:57,917
Hmm.

629
00:30:58,024 --> 00:31:00,399
Slightly elevated lactate and amylase,

630
00:31:00,508 --> 00:31:01,907
and she's very small.

631
00:31:01,909 --> 00:31:03,409
Normal should be lower.

632
00:31:03,476 --> 00:31:05,578
Normal should be lower.

633
00:31:08,329 --> 00:31:10,288
What do you think she has?

634
00:31:13,136 --> 00:31:14,170
Thank you.

635
00:32:13,827 --> 00:32:15,911
W-What the hell? It... it's after 1:00.

636
00:32:15,936 --> 00:32:17,216
I ran tests.

637
00:32:17,218 --> 00:32:18,871
The results were ambiguous.

638
00:32:18,896 --> 00:32:21,043
I think Martine
has intestinal malrotation

639
00:32:21,068 --> 00:32:22,755
and that a volvulus has occurred.

640
00:32:22,757 --> 00:32:25,068
Ambiguous tests told you this.

641
00:32:25,093 --> 00:32:26,558
It's a genetic condition.

642
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,394
The symptoms are very similar to stress.

643
00:32:28,396 --> 00:32:30,162
Call us in the morning.

644
00:32:30,164 --> 00:32:31,597
Okay, she may not be alive
in the morning.

645
00:32:36,036 --> 00:32:37,336
Does your boss know you're here?

646
00:32:39,141 --> 00:32:41,816
No, I think he'd be upset
with me for being here.

647
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:44,376
I am not waking my daughter up

648
00:32:44,378 --> 00:32:45,477
in the middle of a school night

649
00:32:45,479 --> 00:32:46,745
because of some freak.

650
00:32:46,747 --> 00:32:48,147
And you don't need
to call me in the morning,

651
00:32:48,149 --> 00:32:50,582
because I'll be calling
your boss in the morning.

652
00:32:59,427 --> 00:33:00,868
Were you being sarcastic?

653
00:33:00,893 --> 00:33:02,868
- How hard is it to get rid of someone.
- I told him...

654
00:33:02,893 --> 00:33:04,693
You're right. I'm weird.

655
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:07,087
Part of my weirdness
is that I perseverate.

656
00:33:07,112 --> 00:33:09,212
That means I keep thinking about things.

657
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:13,072
So I will keep knocking on your door
until I know Martine is okay.

658
00:33:18,012 --> 00:33:20,020
Martine.

659
00:33:20,317 --> 00:33:21,750
Martine.

660
00:33:22,924 --> 00:33:24,291
Martine.

661
00:33:24,365 --> 00:33:26,348
Martine, you need to wake up!

662
00:33:28,533 --> 00:33:30,268
- Honey?
- Martine?

663
00:33:30,986 --> 00:33:33,225
- She vomited.
- I-I can't wake her!

664
00:33:33,227 --> 00:33:36,061
- I'll call 911.
- N-No. There's no time.

665
00:33:36,063 --> 00:33:37,296
- Do you have a car?
- Yeah.

666
00:33:57,184 --> 00:33:58,884
Shaun...

667
00:33:58,886 --> 00:34:00,819
...what's wrong?

668
00:34:00,821 --> 00:34:01,920
What's wrong?

669
00:34:01,922 --> 00:34:03,963
Hey, hey. You called me. What's wrong?

670
00:34:03,988 --> 00:34:05,668
Hey, look at me. Look at me!

671
00:34:05,693 --> 00:34:07,699
What's... You don't have to say
the whole thing, okay?

672
00:34:07,724 --> 00:34:08,761
Just one thing, okay?

673
00:34:08,763 --> 00:34:10,329
- One thing,
- My... my brother.

674
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:28,684
Hold on, Shaun. Hold on now, hold on.

675
00:34:38,568 --> 00:34:41,043
Her pulse is too weak
to perfuse her organs.

676
00:34:41,068 --> 00:34:43,061
What? What does that...

677
00:34:45,890 --> 00:34:46,965
Jerry!

678
00:34:47,867 --> 00:34:49,007
Please hurry.

679
00:34:54,874 --> 00:34:56,459
Watch your back!

680
00:34:56,484 --> 00:34:57,968
Patient is a 10-year-old female.

681
00:34:57,993 --> 00:35:00,554
She has bradycardia
with hypovolemic shock.

682
00:35:01,822 --> 00:35:04,080
- She needs oxygen, IV adrenaline...
- Go!

683
00:35:04,105 --> 00:35:05,174
...and a liter of saline.

684
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:06,942
- Wide open, please!
- Coming through!

685
00:35:08,456 --> 00:35:10,557
Her pulse is better.
She needs an ultrasound.

686
00:35:16,998 --> 00:35:18,382
That is it.

687
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:19,907
Wow.

688
00:35:22,046 --> 00:35:23,272
I think you got it all.

689
00:35:23,297 --> 00:35:25,481
- You "think"?
- No. You definitely did.

690
00:35:25,506 --> 00:35:27,715
- I just can't quite believe it.
- It was your idea.

691
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:29,807
You should have more confidence.

692
00:35:32,324 --> 00:35:34,083
Nice work, Doctor.

693
00:35:56,148 --> 00:35:57,771
There.

694
00:35:57,896 --> 00:35:59,740
The small bowel is twisted around

695
00:35:59,765 --> 00:36:01,451
the superior mesenteric artery.

696
00:36:01,453 --> 00:36:03,720
Martine needs surgery immediately.

697
00:36:04,115 --> 00:36:06,423
We need to confirm with Dr. Melendez.

698
00:36:06,425 --> 00:36:08,892
N-No. Dr. Melendez is in surgery.

699
00:36:08,894 --> 00:36:10,360
Part of Martine's bowel is dying

700
00:36:10,362 --> 00:36:11,762
- and killing her with it.
- No.

701
00:36:11,764 --> 00:36:13,864
You cannot make these calls on your own.

702
00:36:13,866 --> 00:36:15,332
Dr. Melendez was very clear.

703
00:36:17,001 --> 00:36:18,301
He was very clear.

704
00:36:18,303 --> 00:36:20,184
It's past midnight,
which means it's tomorrow,

705
00:36:20,209 --> 00:36:21,972
which means you're no longer my boss.

706
00:36:24,562 --> 00:36:27,034
Is this the O.R. scheduler?

707
00:36:27,216 --> 00:36:29,369
Yes, this is Dr. Murphy.

708
00:36:29,595 --> 00:36:31,495
Prepare an O.R. for surgery.

709
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:39,856
Ten blade.

710
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,793
I'll take it from here.

711
00:36:49,067 --> 00:36:51,501
Nice diagnosis.
I'll handle the repair work.

712
00:36:53,434 --> 00:36:54,998
Is Stephanie okay?

713
00:36:55,105 --> 00:36:56,604
Yes.

714
00:36:56,708 --> 00:36:58,935
Jared had an excellent idea,
and she's gonna be fine.

715
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,043
- Light.
- Light.

716
00:37:04,149 --> 00:37:05,415
Would you like me to assist?

717
00:37:05,417 --> 00:37:06,610
Mm, pretty basic...

718
00:37:06,635 --> 00:37:08,318
I think I can take this one on my own.

719
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,586
Go home. Get some sleep.

720
00:37:10,869 --> 00:37:12,155
<i>Let him stay.</i>

721
00:37:13,135 --> 00:37:15,469
Dr. Andrews, I believe our opinions

722
00:37:15,494 --> 00:37:17,160
on the wisdom of hiring Dr. Murphy...

723
00:37:17,162 --> 00:37:18,985
<i>That battle is lost.</i>

724
00:37:19,125 --> 00:37:20,697
Shaun is here, and we have to accept it,

725
00:37:20,699 --> 00:37:22,432
and we will treat him
like any other resident.

726
00:37:22,457 --> 00:37:24,534
- Sir, it's my team.
- And it's my department.

727
00:37:26,365 --> 00:37:28,033
Dr. Murphy.

728
00:37:32,386 --> 00:37:34,121
Back on suction... congratulations.

729
00:37:43,689 --> 00:37:44,921
Whoo!

730
00:37:44,923 --> 00:37:46,289
I am gonna get a drink.

731
00:37:46,291 --> 00:37:48,158
I'm way too wound up to sleep.

732
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,639
You care to join me? For either?

733
00:37:50,664 --> 00:37:52,363
Don't think so.

734
00:37:52,493 --> 00:37:54,126
Seriously?

735
00:37:54,199 --> 00:37:55,999
We were just part of something amazing.

736
00:37:56,001 --> 00:37:58,068
We reached into that woman,
and we healed her.

737
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:59,555
And you're what?

738
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,506
Cranky?

739
00:38:01,673 --> 00:38:03,672
Maybe you could learn something from me.

740
00:38:03,697 --> 00:38:05,752
Like what? To steal credit?

741
00:38:05,777 --> 00:38:08,025
Make yourself a hero with Shaun's idea?

742
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:09,546
No, but I fought for it.

743
00:38:09,548 --> 00:38:11,214
I went out on a limb for him.

744
00:38:11,216 --> 00:38:12,749
I deserve credit for that.

745
00:38:13,849 --> 00:38:15,896
Why didn't you rat me out
as soon as I brought it up?

746
00:38:16,998 --> 00:38:19,050
- It seemed beside the point.
- No, you didn't rat me out

747
00:38:19,075 --> 00:38:20,834
'cause you thought the idea was crazy.

748
00:38:21,229 --> 00:38:23,315
You were letting me take the fall.

749
00:38:23,562 --> 00:38:25,395
Is that fair?

750
00:38:26,931 --> 00:38:30,200
My idea if it fails,
but Shaun's if it succeeds?

751
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:33,963
But I'll tell you what...

752
00:38:34,173 --> 00:38:36,578
I'll accept that you're right.

753
00:38:36,636 --> 00:38:38,770
I'll apologize to the whole team

754
00:38:38,944 --> 00:38:41,811
if you prove to me
that you're not a hypocrite.

755
00:38:41,813 --> 00:38:43,813
How am I supposed to prove
something like that?

756
00:38:44,039 --> 00:38:47,451
Our patient's about
to come out of anesthesia.

757
00:38:47,551 --> 00:38:48,783
Tell her the truth.

758
00:38:49,709 --> 00:38:51,922
When she wakes up and hears what we did,

759
00:38:51,924 --> 00:38:54,576
how we miraculously saved her life,

760
00:38:54,779 --> 00:38:57,548
be honest with her... about credit.

761
00:38:57,796 --> 00:38:59,844
Tell her you didn't want to do it.

762
00:39:00,065 --> 00:39:04,282
Tell her that you wanted
to send her home to die.

763
00:39:11,735 --> 00:39:14,477
I hear you got Shaun off scut

764
00:39:14,579 --> 00:39:16,079
and back into surgery.

765
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:19,113
I heard you tried.

766
00:39:19,394 --> 00:39:20,850
You're welcome.

767
00:39:22,848 --> 00:39:24,521
Just a friendly warning...

768
00:39:24,523 --> 00:39:27,590
I know you have no interest
in helping Shaun.

769
00:39:27,592 --> 00:39:29,465
You figure you'll give him
a little authority,

770
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:30,737
he'll screw something up,

771
00:39:30,762 --> 00:39:32,262
and then you'll be done with him,

772
00:39:32,264 --> 00:39:34,531
and then you'll be done with me.

773
00:39:34,833 --> 00:39:36,643
You're right about me.

774
00:39:36,668 --> 00:39:38,661
I am getting old

775
00:39:38,737 --> 00:39:41,671
and maybe a little emotional.

776
00:39:41,974 --> 00:39:45,022
Maybe I over-committed.

777
00:39:45,711 --> 00:39:47,310
But you're wrong about Shaun.

778
00:39:47,397 --> 00:39:50,540
He's gonna handle anything
you throw at him.

779
00:39:51,945 --> 00:39:54,681
Either way, if he succeeds,

780
00:39:54,946 --> 00:39:56,486
I'm the guy who just backed him.

781
00:39:56,488 --> 00:39:59,712
And if he fails, I'm the president.

782
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:20,110
Everything went great.

783
00:40:20,112 --> 00:40:21,911
Thank you. Thank you.

784
00:40:21,913 --> 00:40:24,014
- Thank you.
- There were complications...

785
00:40:24,016 --> 00:40:26,717
- But I'm okay?
- Yeah, but the surgery...

786
00:40:26,742 --> 00:40:28,051
I don't care.

787
00:40:28,053 --> 00:40:30,620
You saved me. Thank you.

788
00:40:30,622 --> 00:40:32,389
My son's going to be here soon.

789
00:40:32,391 --> 00:40:35,881
I told him you said it would be okay,
but he flew in anyway.

790
00:40:36,116 --> 00:40:38,194
You saved me.

791
00:40:41,432 --> 00:40:44,167
You're gonna be a beautiful
mother of the groom.

792
00:41:09,394 --> 00:41:11,027
Go on and take a bow.

793
00:41:11,029 --> 00:41:12,643
You've earned it.

794
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:15,520
Why does it matter who gets credit?

795
00:41:15,673 --> 00:41:19,724
It matters because
the people who get credit,

796
00:41:19,849 --> 00:41:21,738
they don't have to do scut work.

797
00:41:32,484 --> 00:41:35,941
Dr. Murphy, thank you so much.

798
00:41:38,824 --> 00:41:41,891
Thank you!

799
00:42:08,006 --> 00:42:13,006
