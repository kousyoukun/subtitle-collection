1
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:04,980
Autism -- a mental condition

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,150
characterized by difficulty in communicating.

3
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:10,610
Does it sound like I'm describing a surgeon?

4
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:11,940
You saved his life.

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,350
I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.

6
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,260
Never forget, you're the smart one

7
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:16,320
and I'm proud of you, Shaun.

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,940
My brother went to Heaven...

9
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:23,470
...in front of my eyes.

10
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:25,000
He's got a serious deficit.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,080
We hire Shaun,

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,690
and we give hope to those people with limitations

13
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:31,940
that those limitations are not what they think they are,

14
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,180
that they do have a shot!

15
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:38,220
If Shaun doesn't live up to everything I know he can do,

16
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:42,040
I will resign my position as president of this hospital.

17
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:02,270
Where to?

18
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:04,900
San Jose - St. Bonaventure Hospital.

19
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,270
I'm a surgical resident.

20
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,840
Today is my first full day.

21
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,480
I meant floor.

22
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,420
Oh, ground floor.

23
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,790
I'm taking the bus.

24
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,150
This is Mitchell Brand, 55 years old,

25
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,650
post-op day one - from a radical prostatectomy.

26
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:33,450
Morning, Mitchell.

27
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:34,470
I'm Dr. Melendez.

28
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:37,100
These are my residents Dr. Browne and Dr. Kalu.

29
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,590
Your surgery went perfectly.

30
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,430
Yeah.

31
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,160
Am I ever gonna walk again?

32
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:43,040
Yes. Of course.

33
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,930
This is Mitchell Brand.

34
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:46,180
I reviewed his chart.

35
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,950
He's 55 years old from Chicago,

36
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,390
divorced with two children.

37
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,860
You did a radical prostatectomy on him yesterday.

38
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,650
There are many possible complications

39
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,270
but none related to motor neurons.

40
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:57,280
There is no chance you won't be able to walk.

41
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:03,050
He -- he wasn't worried about his legs.

42
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,390
Oh, yes.

43
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:09,030
There's a significant chance of impotence.

44
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,910
Dr. Murphy, you're late.

45
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,700
No, the bus was late.

46
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,950
The schedule was clear.

47
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:15,870
They post it online.

48
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,490
But the 4 bus was late which meant --

49
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,930
- You're late. - Five minutes, we've all been --

50
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:20,230
On your first day, no less.

51
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,150
It is your responsibility to be here.

52
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:22,810
If you are not,

53
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,090
you have failed in your responsibility,

54
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,370
which makes it your fault.

55
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:27,260
Okay, how can it be my fault?

56
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,570
I did nothing wrong. The bus --

57
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:29,950
Yeah. This is gonna work out great.

58
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:32,270
The board clearly made the right choice in hiring you.

59
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:33,710
Thank you.

60
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,570
Dr. Melendez,

61
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:37,590
we've got an emergent consult in the E.R.

62
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:41,580
You should be fine if you can leave it alone for a couple days.

63
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,150
Four days of indigestion,

64
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:46,200
bloating, constipation, and nausea.

65
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,380
And a lot of pain, apparently.

66
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,850
- Did you give her morphine? - Yeah, 10 milligrams.

67
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:53,180
Hasn't touched her pain.

68
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,710
You have time to get a CT?

69
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,500
Yeah. That's why I called you.

70
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,030
That's very big.

71
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,490
Yes, it is.

72
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,150
What are we looking at?

73
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:11,200
It's definitely abutting the aorta and the left kidney.

74
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,160
Renal angiomyolipoma?

75
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,110
- Do you see an extensive blood supply? - No.

76
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,140
Maybe some kind of neurogenic tumor.

77
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:19,690
Or maybe a lymphoma.

78
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,840
She has a sarcoma, a malignant tumor.

79
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:24,720
Malignant?

80
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,740
- That means it's killing me, right? - Yes.

81
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,240
Not necessarily. We're just speculating right now.

82
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,960
No. It's definitely malignant.

83
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,880
If it weren't malignant --

84
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,270
Please stop saying "Malignant".

85
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,410
Should we talk outside?

86
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,250
Give her more morphine. As much as she wants.

87
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:45,630
You scared her.

88
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,730
Didn't need to be so blunt.

89
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:48,690
Why?

90
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:53,400
Her prognosis is terminal without immediate medical intervention.

91
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:54,680
Isn't that scary?

92
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:56,790
Well --

93
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:59,420
That fear does her no good.

94
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,900
Does she have a malignant sarcoma?

95
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,340
Are we gonna be doing a laparotomy?

96
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,930
We need intra-operative staging for the biopsy,

97
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:11,320
extensive dissection of the retroperitoneum,

98
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,860
and excision of the mass with wide, clear margins.

99
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:15,690
I want in.

100
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,150
You do know you're drooling, right?

101
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,230
About cutting open a 40-year-old woman.

102
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,570
Real person. Right behind that door.

103
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,910
It's called bedside manner --

104
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,650
no such thing as outside-the-door manner.

105
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,150
It is exciting, Claire.

106
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,600
We'd be saving a life, and we'd be learning.

107
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,560
See?

108
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,950
Dr. Browne, you're my number two.

109
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,210
With all due respect, doctor --

110
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:36,030
Comments that start that way rarely come across that way.

111
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,690
- I was going to say that's an excellent call. - Thank you.

112
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,380
Jared, prep the surgical team.

113
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,660
Sir, what do I do?

114
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:45,800
Scut work.

115
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,290
What's scut work?

116
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:50,010
Today, I'm gonna need my surgeons to have no distractions.

117
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:52,410
So I'm gonna need you to handle those distractions.

118
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:55,500
All the work they do every day that they hate doing,

119
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,070
you're handling it for them.

120
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:09,280
Make sure they know we still need a consent on that one.

121
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,960
Am I being punished for something?

122
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:17,870
No.

123
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,130
Okay.

124
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:23,220
So that's it?

125
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,750
You just accept my answer at face value?

126
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:26,890
Why?

127
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,480
You're very arrogant.

128
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:32,570
Arrogant people don't think they need to lie.

129
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:35,180
So you must be doing this to teach me.

130
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,310
I look forward to learning from scut work.

131
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,760
Say "Ahh."

132
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:46,480
How long will this be?

133
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:47,880
Seven minutes.

134
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,450
Without any complications,

135
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:53,510
it takes seven minutes to do a discharge examination properly.

136
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,670
Dr. Dunsmuir has already cleared him to go

137
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,500
- and we need the bed. - Okay.

138
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,960
Protocol requires that the surgical department also clears him.

139
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,330
You have an ear infection.

140
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:06,810
Yes, that's why he's here.

141
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:08,250
My hearing's been a little muffled,

142
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,660
and I've had some ringing.

143
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,270
They gave him amoxicillin.

144
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,810
And we're sending him home.

145
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:14,270
Which is why you're here.

146
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,040
To send him home.

147
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:19,500
I'd like an MRI of the head and internal auditory meatus.

148
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,140
I'm not being discharged?

149
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,610
What do you think is wrong?

150
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,580
I'll tell you when I know for sure.

151
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,740
I don't want to scare you.

152
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:41,090
Shaun.

153
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:43,330
What are you doing down here?

154
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,220
I'm waiting for her to fart.

155
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,080
Flatulence.

156
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,020
But I'm using the word "Fart" in front of the patient

157
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,240
to be more casual.

158
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,670
But you're the president of the hospital,

159
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:55,450
so I'll say "Flatulence" to you.

160
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,400
Well, I appreciate that.

161
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,480
Why are you doing that?

162
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,340
She had her deviated septum repaired.

163
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,300
Before we can release her,

164
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:05,490
we have to be sure she isn't suffering from post-operative ileus.

165
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:10,780
This is what Dr. Melendez feels

166
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:13,010
you'll be most useful doing today?

167
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:14,790
Waiting for farts?

168
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,530
I'm not just waiting for farts.

169
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,420
Thank Goodness.

170
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,170
I'm doing all the scut work.

171
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:22,650
Well...

172
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,540
Welcome to your surgical residency.

173
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,590
Thank you.

174
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,440
There. I think that was it.

175
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:39,210
I don't think so.

176
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:41,900
I'll wait a little longer.

177
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,220
This is important.

178
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,390
The procedure is called a laparotomy.

179
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,030
Yeah, your heart sounds good.

180
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:58,430
So, we make a long incision down the middle of your abdomen,

181
00:08:58,430 --> 00:08:59,510
expose the tumor --

182
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,710
Am I going to die?

183
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:06,680
Dr. Melendez is the best surgeon I have ever seen --

184
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,020
Can this all wait?

185
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,140
You have a very serious condition.

186
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,100
It's not advisable to --

187
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,210
Just a couple of weeks. My son is getting married next weekend.

188
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:16,950
They look very happy.

189
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:19,200
After the initial incision --

190
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,020
They've been planning this for months.

191
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,220
If they have to reschedule --

192
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:25,480
Well -- well, this -- this is complicated surgery,

193
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,840
but if all goes well,

194
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,610
recovery is pretty easy.

195
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,410
No need to reschedule anything.

196
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:33,210
And if it doesn't?

197
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:35,090
If it doesn't go well?

198
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,510
My husband died in a car accident

199
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,880
a couple of years ago.

200
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,480
Mark is our only child.

201
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:50,190
I can't die - right before his wedding.

202
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,330
I can't.

203
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,390
You're not gonna die.

204
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,680
You will be at the wedding.

205
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,400
Looking beautiful.

206
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,760
Okay.

207
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,710
You're not supposed to make promises like that, Dr. Browne.

208
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:13,550
Yeah, I told her what she needed to hear.

209
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:16,080
Officially, our legal department's policy is --

210
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,510
tell the ugly truth -- the uglier the better.

211
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:19,540
Is that what you did?

212
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,200
I don't think that's what you did.

213
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,800
Yeah, well, it's a dumb policy.

214
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,990
She needs to have the surgery.

215
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,710
Scaring her would change nothing.

216
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:26,040
Right, because a much better policy

217
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,680
would be to lie to all of our patients

218
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,890
whenever it makes you feel better.

219
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,160
No, it doesn't make me feel better.

220
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,560
It makes her feel better.

221
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,200
I'm pathetic.

222
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:38,870
What?

223
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,140
I am pathetic.

224
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,260
And here's my thinking, so just --

225
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,020
just bear with me,

226
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:45,560
because it kind of insults both of us.

227
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,120
You met that woman an hour ago,

228
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:48,980
and you lied to her.

229
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:52,200
A pity lie because you obviously care about her.

230
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,530
A pity lie that has absolutely zero upside for you,

231
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:57,890
but I can't make you, the world's softest touch,

232
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,090
care about me.

233
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:18,740
I need a consult.

234
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,680
What? You have a question about this?

235
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:23,800
This patient is perfectly healthy.

236
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,540
There's not even any artifact in these images.

237
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:28,530
Yeah, which in turn raises an interesting medical question --

238
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:30,840
why the hell did this patient get an MRI?

239
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,300
I don't know anything about this.

240
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,280
Yeah. Someone on your team ordered it.

241
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,750
It's your responsibility, which makes it your fault.

242
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:40,120
What -- How did you --?

243
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:42,140
It's my department. It's my job to know everything.

244
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:44,710
Well, then, since I work for you,

245
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:46,670
doesn't that make all of this actually your fault?

246
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,600
Oh, I'm sorry, I stopped listening after "I work for you."

247
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,800
Does that hurt?

248
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,260
Yes.

249
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:58,500
Does that hurt?

250
00:11:58,780 --> 00:11:59,590
Yes.

251
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,600
Does that hurt?

252
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:02,900
How much we pay for this?

253
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:03,660
She has a tummy ache.

254
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,240
- That's what they do -- they ache. - Shh.

255
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,170
She's just trying to get out of school. Again.

256
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:08,650
Where do you think she learned that from?

257
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:10,310
You don't think she hears you calling in sick to work

258
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:11,870
right before you go golfing?

259
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,410
I like school.

260
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,640
Me too.

261
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,480
What did you eat for dinner last night?

262
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,060
Cereal.

263
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,560
- I thought you made meatloaf. - I did.

264
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,580
And it got cold while we were waiting for you.

265
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,840
I want D-dimer, lactate, and amylase --

266
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,290
What tests are you ordering?

267
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:28,220
D-dimer, lactate, and amylase.

268
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,900
For a tummy ache? Hmm?

269
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:30,690
Yes.

270
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,930
I'm concerned it may be...

271
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,830
Shall we talk outside?

272
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:38,990
I told you something was wrong.

273
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:40,970
You're happy she might be sick?

274
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:41,810
I'm happy you're wrong.

275
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:43,790
Yeah. Let's talk outside.

276
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:48,650
Have they been bickering like that the whole time?

277
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:51,160
I didn't notice. They aren't sick.

278
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:53,110
Yeah, they're what we call a vector.

279
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:56,030
A carrier. A cause of disease.

280
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:58,100
- You mean the parents? - Yeah.

281
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:59,400
That little girl has a tummy ache

282
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,430
because mommy and daddy won't stop fighting.

283
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:03,260
This isn't a medical issue. Send them home.

284
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,840
Could be intestinal malrotation,

285
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,490
which could quickly become fatal.

286
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,890
And every patient in this hospital could have malaria,

287
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,270
but that doesn't mean we're gonna go around testing

288
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:12,210
for every condition we think they could have.

289
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:13,780
For example, that MRI you ordered

290
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,520
on the guy with the ear infection?

291
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:16,930
Nice call, genius.

292
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:17,910
Thank you.

293
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:19,630
I was being sarcastic.

294
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:20,950
It's normal. He's healthy.

295
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:22,100
Send him home, too.

296
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,170
Why are you smiling?

297
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,520
Because you're right.

298
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:28,250
So you thought he was making a mistake

299
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,580
and didn't say anything?

300
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:32,000
Just stood by watching, taking notes

301
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,750
while he wasted everybody's time?

302
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,920
Is that your job?

303
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,490
In my experience,

304
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:37,960
doctors don't listen to nurses.

305
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,520
And they only talk to us to lecture us

306
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,280
when they figure we screwed something up.

307
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:48,740
From now on, you don't run any tests you don't have to run.

308
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:51,840
How do I know if a test is needed until after I run it?

309
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,210
She'll tell you.

310
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:56,080
Today, she's your boss.

311
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:15,190
I could never eat before surgery.

312
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,220
Puke? I could do that.

313
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,180
I get cranky if I don't eat.

314
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,630
- I hear Shaun made the call. - Mm.

315
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,610
He's an excellent diagnostician.

316
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:27,670
You should get him a job in radiology.

317
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,410
He doesn't want to be a radiologist.

318
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,890
He wants to be a surgeon.

319
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:32,710
That's what we hired him to be.

320
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,020
That's what I worked damn hard to hire him to be.

321
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:38,180
Not a glorified orderly.

322
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,800
Every resident does scut work.

323
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,630
So you're treating him like anybody else?

324
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,710
- Are you? - Yes, yes, I am.

325
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:45,900
He more than earned the right to be here.

326
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,630
He has had to get past people like you

327
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,800
and their prejudices every step of the way.

328
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,900
- Prejudices? - Yeah, prejudices.

329
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:55,030
You have any idea how many patients he's scared the crap out of today?

330
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:56,930
How many wasted tests he ordered?

331
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,310
So teach him.

332
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:59,370
I'm doing that.

333
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,870
I'm teaching you both that he doesn't belong.

334
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:05,260
Okay.

335
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:08,210
You're gonna make me pull rank, I will pull rank.

336
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,080
This is my hospital.

337
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,800
But it's my team.

338
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,650
You can't tell me how to run my team.

339
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:27,790
How are you doing?

340
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:29,940
What's the point of sarcasm?

341
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:37,720
Like, sometimes, - it's a way of critiquing people

342
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,250
in a way that's funny

343
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:40,920
so they don't feel quite so bad.

344
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,370
Isn't it just lying?

345
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,280
Well, it's not lying,

346
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,070
because people know you're lying.

347
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:48,470
I'm not good at that.

348
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:52,070
You may remember me from last year.

349
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:53,510
We sell chocolate bars every year

350
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:56,040
to pay for our class trip to Mt. Rushmore.

351
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:56,540
Okay.

352
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:59,470
But this year we're not going to Mt. Rushmore,

353
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:01,340
because Kenny can't go.

354
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,160
He's got cancer.

355
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,660
So, Samantha had the idea

356
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,900
that if he can't go, none of us would go,

357
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,780
and we all thought that was a great idea.

358
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,260
So, we're gonna have a party at the hospital for him.

359
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,560
There are two Kennys in your class.

360
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:17,310
Is it Kenny L. Or Kenny M.?

361
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,490
No one's sick.

362
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,250
Well, you lied?

363
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:22,150
- You weren't supposed to lie. - Yeah.

364
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,030
And you and me aren't supposed to starve.

365
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,450
We need money for food.

366
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,620
Was any of that true?

367
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:28,700
Yeah.

368
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,000
We're not going to Mt. Rushmore.

369
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:38,620
I can't discharge people

370
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,510
if I think they might still be sick.

371
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,820
Of course not. Why would you?

372
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,110
Dr. Melendez made Nurse Fryday my boss today.

373
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:48,650
Should I speak to Dr. Glassman?

374
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:49,490
No.

375
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:52,860
What did you think this job was?

376
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,410
To save people's lives.

377
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:55,650
No.

378
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:59,060
I mean, yeah, - sometimes we do save lives.

379
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:00,530
But the job...

380
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,510
It's doing whatever Melendez asks us to do.

381
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:06,700
Paging Dr. Browne.

382
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:08,990
Paging Dr. Browne to the O.R.

383
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,890
I'm Dr. Claire Browne.

384
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:19,840
I'm first assist today,

385
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,580
and I'll be leading the timeout.

386
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:24,490
- Patient's name? - Stephanie Willis.

387
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,220
Scheduled surgery?

388
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:29,180
Excision of an indeterminate retroperitoneal tumor.

389
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,830
We don't anticipate any complications with the surgery.

390
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:32,990
Thank you, Dr. Browne.

391
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,140
Ten blade.

392
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:36,880
Ten blade.

393
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,420
Let's remove a tumor.

394
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:51,490
Excuse me.

395
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:56,950
No.

396
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:00,910
It might be infected.

397
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:01,460
It's not.

398
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:03,340
There is some discoloration.

399
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,820
He's 82 years old.

400
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,400
Everything is discolored.

401
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:15,010
Once we get through the muscle layer,

402
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,310
proceed carefully.

403
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,090
Blood pressure, 120 over 70.

404
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:20,280
Heart rate 60.

405
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:21,570
She's holding steady.

406
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,470
I've opened the facia.

407
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,560
You kept your puke?

408
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:31,490
Yeah, I thought you'd want to see it.

409
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,080
It looks like puke.

410
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,600
No. No, no. It's not the regular color.

411
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:38,930
Your puke has a regular color?

412
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:39,670
Yeah.

413
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:41,890
It is a bit of an unusual color.

414
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:43,550
We could order some...

415
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,480
I'm sending you home.

416
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:48,980
You sure?

417
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,700
It -- It's safe for me to go home?

418
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:54,600
I don't know what to say.

419
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,160
You'll learn.

420
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:57,790
By doing.

421
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,560
My brother said there's a kid named Kenny,

422
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,200
and he's sick, and there might --

423
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,710
you should give us money.

424
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:20,590
So, am I okay?

425
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,020
Am -- Am I okay?

426
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,790
According to all hospital rules

427
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,220
and direct instructions given to me, yes.

428
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,430
We need a better exposure of this tumor.

429
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:47,840
Let's get the deep Balfour in here.

430
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,970
Deep Balfour retractor.

431
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:52,520
Let's get this thing open.

432
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,230
I've got to see where it's safe to cut.

433
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,990
I can't see anywhere where this tumor hasn't encased her arteries.

434
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,500
Claire, tell me you got something.

435
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,640
I've got nothing.

436
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:05,360
This tumor is way bigger than it looked on the scans.

437
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,680
I...I can't even see her aorta.

438
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:13,480
That's a problem.

439
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,990
Is that the girl with the bickering parents?

440
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,720
Didn't we send her home four hours ago?

441
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,070
Dr. Murphy,

442
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,870
Dr. Melendez needs you in surgery.

443
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,590
That won't be necessary.

444
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,790
The tumor's entirely encased the large abdominal arteries.

445
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:11,830
That's very bad.

446
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:12,970
If it's in the artery walls,

447
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:15,710
it's going to be impossible to cut out without killing her.

448
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:18,900
You should get a biopsy to determine where the margins are.

449
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:20,270
Thank you.

450
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,780
You're welcome.

451
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:24,230
I was being sarcastic... again.

452
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:27,890
I-I see, because you are already know everything I said,

453
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:30,310
and you already sent a biopsy to the lab?

454
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:32,510
Yes, 'cause I'm a doctor, too.

455
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,610
Yes. But you need me?

456
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:37,440
Yeah, I need you to run down to the lab and hurry them along.

457
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,550
I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.

458
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:57,140
I'm a surgical resident.

459
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,250
Dr. Melendez sent you a biopsy.

460
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,640
When will the results be ready?

461
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,320
When I get to it.

462
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,680
It's very important.

463
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:05,730
They're all very important.

464
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,850
Let me see the other test orders.

465
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:10,690
I'll tell you which ones are most important,

466
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:12,370
and you can do them in that order.

467
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:13,870
I'll be honest and fair.

468
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:16,990
That is not the way that it works.

469
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:19,090
Now go wait your turn.

470
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,010
Do it again.

471
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:36,860
- Get the hell away from me, you moron. - Let's get out of here!

472
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:40,880
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

473
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,760
If you want to get anything in life, Shaun,

474
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,250
there's one thing you got to do.

475
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,670
Never be afraid.

476
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,940
You're the moron!

477
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:10,860
If you don't do - Dr. Melendez's test right now,

478
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:13,170
I will throw a rock through your window.

479
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,130
Well, I wouldn't want that.

480
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:24,320
Go have a seat.

481
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,070
Your results will be ready in 15 minutes.

482
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:38,830
You got a minute?

483
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:40,730
I have a patient lying in the O.R.

484
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:42,260
waiting for lab results,

485
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,580
and I'm sitting here trying to figure out

486
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,530
what the hell I'm gonna do next,

487
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:45,990
and I don't like any of my options,

488
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:48,790
so...yeah, unfortunately it seems I do.

489
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,900
Okay, we can talk another time.

490
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,070
Glassman talked to you?

491
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,610
I don't have a problem with an autistic doctor.

492
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:58,760
No, you just have a problem with one working for you.

493
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,500
Really? That's how you see me?

494
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,040
Let's not make this personal.

495
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,870
You're accusing me of prejudice.

496
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:08,270
I have a problem with the doctor who has a problem with communication.

497
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:11,850
Okay, let's make this personal.

498
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,420
Who do you respect at this hospital?

499
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:18,320
You and Glassman.

500
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:20,590
And who do you not respect?

501
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:25,450
And does it bother you

502
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:27,870
that it looks like - you're on the wrong team?

503
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,990
If the tumor hasn't invaded into the arterial walls,

504
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,770
we could create a plane of dissection.

505
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,510
Well, if it's a noninvasive liposarcoma

506
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:38,140
we can work it off from the outside.

507
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,600
Blunt dissection and tissue forceps --

508
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,050
peel it off piece by piece.

509
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:53,300
It's a leiomyosarcoma.

510
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,010
Well, that sucks.

511
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:58,330
Yes, it's sad.

512
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,730
The surgery's impossible.

513
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:02,540
Well, might as well wake her up --

514
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:05,400
let her know she has three months to live,

515
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,920
offer palliative care.

516
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,740
The surgery isn't impossible --

517
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,980
just, very, very, very difficult.

518
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:21,670
Yes, in the sense that we'll be operating blind.

519
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:24,420
Yes, because the left kidney is in the way.

520
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,820
The healthy left kidney.

521
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:27,480
Both kidneys are healthy, Jared.

522
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,530
She only needs one.

523
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,740
Without the left one, it's theoretically possible

524
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:32,410
to access the tumor and remove it.

525
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:34,580
You're suggesting we cut out a perfectly healthy organ

526
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,040
- just to get a better view? - Yes.

527
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,780
- But she might die anyway. - Yes. Quite probably.

528
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,730
I have to go. I have a boil to lance.

529
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,560
I mean, it's a brilliant...

530
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:51,950
very, very, very terrible idea.

531
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:56,070
Close her up and wake her up.

532
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,040
Who wants to join me when I tell her

533
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,580
she has six weeks left to live?

534
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:04,010
There is one possibility.

535
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,810
If we removed the left kidney,

536
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:10,250
we might be able to get a good enough view

537
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:11,630
to successfully remove the mass.

538
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,190
Take out a healthy kidney

539
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,950
to get a better view?

540
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:16,370
That's insane.

541
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:19,730
A good view's half the battle in any operation.

542
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,480
Most likely outcome is

543
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,350
we'd be depriving her of what little time she has left.

544
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,620
But if we succeed...

545
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:26,330
No --

546
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:29,080
You want to do this 'cause it's exciting.

547
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,210
You want to be a hero.

548
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:32,920
But if you fail, this woman dies.

549
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,600
She misses her son's wedding.

550
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:37,530
Well, that's the issue, isn't it?

551
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,700
You promised this woman she'll be okay.

552
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:50,740
She had to do this surgery.

553
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,680
I might as well tell her good things.

554
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,440
The reason we don't make patients promises

555
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,990
isn't just for legal.

556
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:58,660
Jared's right. Your judgment is compromised.

557
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,230
- I still think -- You're not objective.

558
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:01,580
Who the hell is?

559
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:05,180
We should at least wake her up,

560
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,710
explain what we found, what we're hoping to do,

561
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:09,510
and get a new consent.

562
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:10,620
What we're hoping to do

563
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,920
is exactly what you told her we were going to do --

564
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:14,170
remove that tumor.

565
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:15,490
The only thing we'd be explaining is

566
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:17,190
why you undersold the risks.

567
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:20,070
We're doing the surgery.

568
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:22,860
And, Jared, - you're my new number two.

569
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,090
Mayos.

570
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:39,120
Mayos.

571
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:45,520
I'm going to open the fascia and expose the kidney.

572
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,900
You clamp the renal hilum.

573
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:47,610
Clamp.

574
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:48,490
Clamp.

575
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:58,530
We just cut off the blood supply to a perfectly healthy kidney.

576
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,520
If we needed color commentary,

577
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,630
I would have hired Jeff Van Gundy.

578
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,690
Shaun, I believe you've met Trevor.

579
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:13,890
Yes. I sent him home.

580
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,630
Yes, well, he didn't go home.

581
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:20,460
He actually came to the president of the hospital instead.

582
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,620
H-He said you sent him home

583
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:22,950
even though you thought he was sick.

584
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:24,630
I specifically never said that.

585
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:26,300
- I made sure not to say that. - No. Oh.

586
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,640
What -- what the hell does that mean?

587
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,510
- What does that mean, Shaun? - A-Am I healthy?

588
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:30,940
- Probably. - You're a doctor.

589
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,210
You're -- - you're supposed to know.

590
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,460
No, we're not -- Nobody knows anything for sure.

591
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:36,890
Anybody could drop dead of a heart attack at any time.

592
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:38,080
Who is this guy?

593
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,970
Am I -- Am I gonna have a heart attack?

594
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:45,070
Shaun has some difficulty with certain social interactions,

595
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:47,390
- but if he says that - - I don't give a crap what he says.

596
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,540
W-What do you say?

597
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:49,680
Am I healthy?

598
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,810
I've reviewed your chart,

599
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,370
and I can say with complete confidence

600
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:56,850
that you are in peak physical condition.

601
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:57,980
Thank God.

602
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:12,200
Shaun, people need reassurance.

603
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,760
I told him he was safe to go home.

604
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,870
- I was very clear. - W-With your words --

605
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:19,010
Your actions said something completely different.

606
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:19,800
No, they didn't.

607
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,940
My actions were completely silent.

608
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:26,380
When you reassure someone, they have to receive it.

609
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,810
You have to gauge

610
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:30,780
whether they actually are reassured.

611
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:32,070
You understand?

612
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:36,230
When did you review Trevor's chart?

613
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:38,360
I didn't.

614
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,470
It's not really a lie.

615
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:42,630
If you say - that he is safe to go home,

616
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:45,480
then I know for a fact that he's safe to go home.

617
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:49,580
I sent a girl home today.

618
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:54,200
How often do people develop stomach issues

619
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,460
because of their brain?

620
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,780
Based on my personal experience?

621
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:59,100
Every single day.

622
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,960
I want D-dimer, lactate, and amylase

623
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:06,270
for a 10-year-old girl, Martine LaDuff.

624
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:09,070
She might have a tummy ache caused by stress.

625
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:10,750
Or she might not.

626
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:12,560
Hi, Shaun.

627
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:13,950
Hi, Carly.

628
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,430
That's a lot of tests for an upset stomach.

629
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:17,780
You could get in trouble.

630
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,380
That's definitely true.

631
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:23,380
Remove the kidney.

632
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:26,180
All right. It's coming out.

633
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:30,710
OK.

634
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,150
Let's get in there with some suction, Claire,

635
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:40,250
so we can get a better view of what we're dealing with.

636
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:46,870
There it is.

637
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,670
It's a mess.

638
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:53,430
Yes, it is.

639
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:55,270
But now it's a mess we can see.

640
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,100
Everything is within normal range.

641
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,820
Slightly elevated lactate and amylase,

642
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,320
and she's very small.

643
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,000
Normal should be lower.

644
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:08,410
Normal should be lower.

645
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:13,320
What do you think she has?

646
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,470
Thank you.

647
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,310
W-What the hell? It -- it's after 1:00.

648
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,750
I ran tests.

649
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:22,140
The results were ambiguous.

650
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,520
I think Martine has intestinal malrotation

651
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,010
and that a volvulus has occurred.

652
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:28,290
Ambiguous tests told you this.

653
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,990
It's a genetic condition.

654
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:32,100
The symptoms - are very similar to stress.

655
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,450
Call us in the morning.

656
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:35,340
Okay, she may not be alive in the morning.

657
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:40,950
Does your boss know you're here?

658
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:45,320
No, I think he'd be upset with me for being here.

659
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:48,900
I am not waking my daughter up in the middle of a school night

660
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,290
because of some freak.

661
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:51,400
And you don't need - to call me in the morning,

662
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,960
because I'll be calling your boss in the morning.

663
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,310
Were you being sarcastic?

664
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:06,280
- How hard is it to get rid of someone. - I told him --

665
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,390
You're right. I'm weird.

666
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,490
Part of my weirdness is that I perseverate.

667
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:12,520
That means I keep thinking about things.

668
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,230
So I will keep knocking on your door

669
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:16,230
until I know Martine is okay.

670
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:22,530
Martine.

671
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:24,710
Martine.

672
00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:27,680
Martine.

673
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:29,830
Martine, you need to wake up!

674
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,700
- Honey? - Martine?

675
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:35,470
She vomited.

676
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:36,540
I-I can't wake her!

677
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,470
I'll call 911.

678
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:39,370
N-No. There's no time.

679
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:41,000
- Do you have a car? - Yeah.

680
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:02,610
Shaun...

681
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,060
...what's wrong?

682
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:05,060
What's wrong?

683
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,200
You called me. What's wrong?

684
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,040
Hey, look at me. Look at me!

685
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,080
What's -- You don't have to say the whole thing, okay?

686
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,470
Just one thing, okay?

687
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:13,870
- One thing. - My -- my brother.

688
00:34:29,970 --> 00:34:32,340
Hold on, Shaun. Hold on now, hold on.

689
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,700
Her pulse is too weak to perfuse her organs.

690
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,380
What? What does that --

691
00:34:49,910 --> 00:34:50,780
Jerry!

692
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,380
Please hurry.

693
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:02,520
Patient is a 10-year-old female.

694
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:05,060
She has bradycardia with hypovolemic shock.

695
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:08,690
- She needs oxygen, IV adrenaline... - Go!

696
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:09,730
...and a liter of saline.

697
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:11,730
- Wide open, please! - Coming through!

698
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:15,470
Her pulse is better. She needs an ultrasound.

699
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:22,930
That is it.

700
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:27,830
I think you got it all.

701
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:30,210
- You "Think"? - No. You definitely did.

702
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:31,380
I just can't quite believe it.

703
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,200
It was your idea.

704
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,740
You should have more confidence.

705
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:38,290
Nice work, Doctor.

706
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:01,790
There.

707
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,240
The small bowel is twisted around the superior mesenteric artery.

708
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,580
Martine needs surgery immediately.

709
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:11,100
We need to confirm with Dr. Melendez.

710
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,600
N-No. Dr. Melendez is in surgery.

711
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:15,200
Part of Martine's bowel is dying

712
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,460
- and killing her with it. - No.

713
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:18,350
You cannot make these calls on your own.

714
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:20,000
Dr. Melendez was very clear.

715
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,860
He was very clear.

716
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:24,640
It's past midnight, which means it's tomorrow,

717
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,400
which means you're no longer my boss.

718
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:30,980
Is this the O.R. scheduler?

719
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:33,890
Yes, this is Dr. Murphy.

720
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,870
Prepare an O.R. for surgery.

721
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:44,280
Ten blade.

722
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:45,600
Ten blade.

723
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:52,820
I'll take it from here.

724
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:56,280
Nice diagnosis. I'll handle the repair work.

725
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:59,520
Is Stephanie okay?

726
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,310
Yes.

727
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:03,520
Jared had an excellent idea, and she's gonna be fine.

728
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:04,780
- Light. - Light.

729
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,280
Would you like me to assist?

730
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:11,170
Mm, pretty basic --

731
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:12,960
I think I can take this one on my own.

732
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,400
Go home. Get some sleep.

733
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:16,800
Let him stay.

734
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:20,080
Dr. Andrews, I believe our opinions

735
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:21,730
on the wisdom of hiring Dr. Murphy --

736
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:23,670
That battle is lost.

737
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:25,230
Shaun is here, - and we have to accept it,

738
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:27,010
and we will treat him like any other resident.

739
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:27,880
Sir, it's my team.

740
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,340
And it's my department.

741
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:32,300
Dr. Murphy.

742
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:39,230
Back on suction -- congratulations.

743
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,660
I am gonna get a drink.

744
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:52,330
I'm way too wound up to sleep.

745
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:53,960
You care to join me?

746
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:55,150
For either?

747
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,330
Don't think so.

748
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:58,040
Seriously?

749
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:00,710
We were just part of something amazing.

750
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,650
We reached into that woman, and we healed her.

751
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:03,560
And you're what?

752
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:05,000
Cranky?

753
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:08,280
Maybe you could learn something from me.

754
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:09,090
Like what?

755
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:10,470
To steal credit?

756
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:12,440
Make yourself a hero with Shaun's idea?

757
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,890
No, but I fought for it.

758
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:15,660
I went out on a limb for him.

759
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,500
I deserve credit for that.

760
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,770
Why didn't you rat me out as soon as I brought it up?

761
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:22,800
It seemed beside the point.

762
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,590
No, you didn't rat me out

763
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:25,260
'cause you thought the idea was crazy.

764
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:28,010
You were letting me take the fall.

765
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:29,960
Is that fair?

766
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:35,180
My idea if it fails, but Shaun's if it succeeds?

767
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,030
But I'll tell you what --

768
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,390
I'll accept that you're right.

769
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,000
I'll apologize to the whole team

770
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:46,400
if you prove to me that you're not a hypocrite.

771
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:48,570
How am I supposed to prove something like that?

772
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:51,480
Our patient's about to come out of anesthesia.

773
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:53,420
Tell her the truth.

774
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,360
When she wakes up and hears what we did,

775
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:59,240
how we miraculously saved her life,

776
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:01,990
be honest with her -- about credit.

777
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:04,230
Tell her - you didn't want to do it.

778
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:08,490
Tell her that you wanted to send her home to die.

779
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:20,650
I hear you got Shaun off scut and back into surgery.

780
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:23,130
I heard you tried.

781
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,690
You're welcome.

782
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:28,950
Just a friendly warning --

783
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:32,100
I know you have no interest in helping Shaun.

784
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,910
You figure you'll give him a little authority,

785
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:35,220
he'll screw something up,

786
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,530
and then you'll be done with him,

787
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:39,380
and then you'll be done with me.

788
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:41,290
You're right about me.

789
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:43,080
I am getting old

790
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,920
and maybe a little emotional.

791
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:48,310
Maybe I over-committed.

792
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,950
But you're wrong about Shaun.

793
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:54,580
He's gonna handle anything you throw at him.

794
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:58,760
Either way, if he succeeds,

795
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:01,070
I'm the guy who just backed him.

796
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:04,160
And if he fails, I'm the president.

797
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:24,640
Everything went great.

798
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:26,510
Thank you. Thank you.

799
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:28,720
- Thank you. - There were complications --

800
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,330
- But I'm okay? - Yeah, but the surgery --

801
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:32,560
I don't care.

802
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:34,770
You saved me. Thank you.

803
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,670
My son's going to be here soon.

804
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:38,410
I told him - you said it would be okay,

805
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:39,900
but he flew in anyway.

806
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,130
You saved me.

807
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:48,580
You're gonna be a beautiful mother of the groom.

808
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:15,870
Go on and take a bow.

809
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:16,960
You've earned it.

810
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:19,280
Why does it matter who gets credit?

811
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:23,530
It matters because - the people who get credit,

812
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:26,280
they don't have to do scut work.

813
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:40,040
Dr. Murphy, thank you so much.

814
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:44,200
Thank you!
