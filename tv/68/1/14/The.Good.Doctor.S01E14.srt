1
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:10,700
Morning, doc!

2
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:13,690
Good morning, Kenny.

3
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,020
Brosef, your cable's out.

4
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:26,460
I don't have cable.

5
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,430
I have a digital antenna.

6
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:28,960
Why?

7
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:35,020
Digital antennae receive superior picture and sound quality,

8
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,790
and the channels are free.

9
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:38,370
Yeah, but you get, like, 10 channels that way.

10
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,080
I only watch three.

11
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,060
You mind if I run a line to your tube?

12
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,000
Cable guy can't fit me in till next week.

13
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,520
Come on, 10 channels are better than none.

14
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,910
Yes, they are.

15
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:51,780
All right.

16
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:53,440
Gracias, amigo.

17
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,560
No hay na que agradecer.

18
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,240
What?

19
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:03,190
Dr. Reznick was orphaned once Dr. Coyle was transferred,

20
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:04,600
so she'll be joining our team.

21
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,230
Hi. I'm Claire.

22
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,270
Nice to meet you.

23
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:10,800
Are you the autistic one?

24
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:11,740
No.

25
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,440
That's me.

26
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,200
Dr. Shaun Murphy.

27
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:19,320
We've got two pretty straightforward cases,

28
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:22,360
nice level playing field for an eager group.

29
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,330
Not interested.

30
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:25,560
Competition can foster teamwork,

31
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,090
which can lead to a greater understanding

32
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:30,150
and appreciation of residents' strengths and weaknesses

33
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,750
and improve patient care.

34
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:34,630
You're playing the same game Glassman had us do when we were interns.

35
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:35,560
Not interested.

36
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,470
Winning team gets first dibs

37
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,630
on assisting on all surgeries next week.

38
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:40,450
- In. - In.

39
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:41,250
Out.

40
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,380
I pick the boy genius.

41
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:52,970
That's you.

42
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,290
Dr. Browne.

43
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:07,990
Kalu.

44
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,350
Dr. Reznick.

45
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:12,020
Thank you. I'm looking forward to it.

46
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:15,680
Thank you.

47
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,710
Same stakes as last time?

48
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,330
Absolutely.

49
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:26,980
Hi, Quinn.

50
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,300
We hear you've had some stomach pain.

51
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,480
Do you mind if we take a look?

52
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,900
It doesn't hurt that bad.

53
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,840
Poor thing says everything is okay,

54
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,410
but when Quinnie didn't want to go swimming today,

55
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:37,680
I knew that something must be wrong.

56
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,670
We'll be as gentle with her as possible.

57
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,700
Quinn's parents are out of town,

58
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,630
so I'm -- I flew in to babysit.

59
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,390
Okay.

60
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:54,500
Let's see.

61
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,270
- That's a... - Penis.

62
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,560
She's not a girl.

63
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,540
He's a boy.

64
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,210
It's just a phase.

65
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,620
Stop saying that.

66
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,210
I'm not a boy. I'm a girl.

67
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:21,130
- You're transgender? - Yes.

68
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:21,730
No.

69
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:25,170
Quinn has XY chromosomes like Jared and me,

70
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:26,700
not XX like you.

71
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,540
Science says he's male.

72
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,980
No, Quinn has gender dysphoria.

73
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,720
Her assigned gender is not the one she identifies with.

74
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,330
She's mismatched, Dr. Murphy.

75
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:36,440
But biologically --

76
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,870
Other than biologically,

77
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,880
how do you know - you're supposed to be a boy?

78
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:44,170
Your question doesn't make sense.

79
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:45,940
I'm not supposed to be anything.

80
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,130
I am a boy.

81
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,010
Biologically, that's it.

82
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,400
Okay, deep tenderness at McBurney's point.

83
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,980
Could be acute appendicitis.

84
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,400
Murphy, get imaging to confirm.

85
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:09,690
Mr. Shaw, your chart says that you passed out in class.

86
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:11,430
- What do you teach? - History.

87
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:13,740
I got a little dizzy because I skipped breakfast.

88
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:14,780
I-it's nothing.

89
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:17,070
The school insisted on calling an ambulance.

90
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,770
Taken any medications in the last few months?

91
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:22,440
Uh, I took some Vicodin

92
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,910
after I threw out my back six weeks ago,

93
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,510
and then I had a stomach flu, so I took Ofloxacin.

94
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,670
But the flu part didn't totally go away,

95
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:34,030
so I took Azithromycin and Prednisone

96
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,800
because my glands were swollen.

97
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,640
But I still had a sore throat, so I took some Cipro.

98
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,870
What doctor prescribed you all that?

99
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:46,370
Uh, they were leftovers I had in my medicine cabinet.

100
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,250
All right, lay back for me.

101
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:54,130
Look, I'm a single dad with twins

102
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:58,260
who bring home every disgusting germ they touch at preschool.

103
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:00,410
I can't afford to miss work.

104
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,770
You've got a fever and you've gone through two IVs

105
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:06,820
which tells me that you're severely dehydrated.

106
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,810
You can't stand me touching your stomach without wincing in pain.

107
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,790
Dr. Reznick, let's get Mr. Shaw here an ultrasound.

108
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,710
- We've been trying for while. - Five months.

109
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,030
I realize my prime egg days were two decades ago,

110
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,200
but I've been vigilant.

111
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,640
Ovulation kits, LH and FSH testing,

112
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,560
basal body temp.

113
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,980
I've checked my estradiol and AMH levels.

114
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:28,040
The old-fashioned way wasn't working.

115
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,890
Okay, well, there are a lot of possibilities to consider.

116
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:34,200
Many benign, many easily corrected.

117
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,350
So I will take some samples from you both,

118
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:37,880
run some tests, we go from there.

119
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:38,860
There's a clock.

120
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:41,320
We need to know - if we start with IUI or IVF...

121
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,980
Both of you -- you need to stop worrying.

122
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:47,140
Isabel, you are not the first 40-something woman

123
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,000
to come here and ask these questions.

124
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,510
Myself included.

125
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:53,850
You came to me - because you trust me, yes?

126
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,480
Right. So let me do what I do,

127
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,520
and you two focus on each other.

128
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,080
We're a team, babe.

129
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,620
In this together, all right?

130
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,470
Okay.

131
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,290
I'm afraid, Howard, your appendix has already ruptured.

132
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:22,450
Book an OR stat and page Melendez.

133
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:24,790
Wait. I need to figure out who's gonna take care of my kids,

134
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,970
call the school so they can get subs for my classes.

135
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,310
Mr. Shaw, if we don't get you into surgery now,

136
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:31,600
your infection could spread and you could become septic.

137
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,770
Dr. Browne will make all the necessary phone calls

138
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,250
while I prep you for surgery.

139
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,820
Isn't that so, Dr. Browne?

140
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,590
You're in good hands, Mr. Shaw.

141
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:41,770
We've got you covered.

142
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:42,660
Let's go.

143
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:51,770
Hello.

144
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:53,650
Do you wear dresses?

145
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:55,810
Murphy, don't.

146
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:58,940
Quinn is a boy who thinks he's a girl.

147
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,870
I want to know why he thinks that.

148
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:03,670
Sometimes I wear dresses, but sometimes I wear leggings.

149
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:06,890
Do you like the color pink?

150
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,020
I'm more of a purple girl.

151
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:13,000
- Do you play with dolls? - Since I was 5, but I'm super into mermaids.

152
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,690
Do you take dance --

153
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:15,880
Murphy, 20 questions are up.

154
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,410
I only asked four.

155
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:18,470
- Do you wear perfume? - It doesn't matter.

156
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:19,170
The CT's ready. Let's go.

157
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:21,540
- Do you always paint your nails? - Let's go.

158
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,790
Perforated appendix is out.

159
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,760
Lavage or no lavage.

160
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,680
Dr. Browne.

161
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,850
Lavage before closing the wound

162
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,920
decreases residual fluid accumulation

163
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,930
- and minimizes residual contamination. - Claire's right.

164
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:46,580
Although, a recent study documented a higher abscess rate

165
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:49,390
when irrigation was used for perforated appendicitis.

166
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,790
Well, someone did their homework.

167
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,340
I'm partial to AMSURG

168
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,540
since they published me.

169
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,270
As a medical student?

170
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:57,640
It was about the cost and stabilization of disease

171
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,420
in patients undergoing transcatheter

172
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,170
and surgical aortic valve replacement.

173
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:03,430
Are you thinking of specializing in cardio-thoracic?

174
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,670
A girl can dream.

175
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,500
Staple up and close up.

176
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,810
It's, uh --

177
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:13,690
it's good to have you on board, Morgan.

178
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,430
It's great to have another female surgeon.

179
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,460
I'm sorry,

180
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,600
you and I are not gonna be friends,

181
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,450
hanging out, having sleepovers,

182
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:25,950
braiding each other's hair.

183
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,080
That's not exactly - where I was going with it.

184
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:30,070
When residency's over,

185
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:32,160
the hospital's likely only keeping two of us.

186
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:34,780
Shaun is Glassman's pet project, so he's in.

187
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,160
Jared is persona non grata, so he's out.

188
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,440
Which means every time you win, I lose.

189
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:40,590
And vice versa.

190
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,090
Thanks for the heads up.

191
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:01,060
Do you think he's complicated or confused?

192
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,390
Dude, you've got to quit calling her a "He."

193
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,770
We're never going to win this competition

194
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:07,240
with you disrespecting our patient.

195
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,580
- Don't they have transgender people in Wyoming? - Okay.

196
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,930
Transgender patient care

197
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:15,240
was not part of my - medical school curriculum.

198
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,630
Was it part of yours?

199
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,620
No.

200
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:27,030
Quinn doesn't have appendicitis.

201
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,000
He has testicular cancer.

202
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,000
She.

203
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:40,240
We found a mass on Quinn's left testicle.

204
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,710
She has cancer, but --

205
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43,210
- Am I gonna die? - No, no.

206
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,610
Prognosis is very good.

207
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:45,880
We've caught it before it spread,

208
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,940
and we'll do surgery on the mass to remove it.

209
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:51,250
The CT also showed he has osteopenia.

210
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:53,080
Murphy, stop with the "He."

211
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:57,220
Quinnie, it's your mom.

212
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,320
I -- I have to --

213
00:09:58,330 --> 00:09:59,280
Of course.

214
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,340
Osteopenia.

215
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,530
- That's low bone density, right? - Yeah.

216
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:06,830
How'd you know that?

217
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,280
Do you know how I got cancer?

218
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:10,760
There are several - possible causes, but I --

219
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,590
- Microlithiasis, mumps, hypospadias -- - Murphy.

220
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:15,830
Intraepithelial germ cell neoplasia,

221
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:17,230
inguinal hernia, HIV --

222
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:19,340
Murphy. Enough.

223
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,940
Your parents are on their way here.

224
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:23,890
Um, they just told me --

225
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,690
Quinn, are you on puberty blockers?

226
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,130
That's the likely cause of the osteopenia.

227
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,580
Are you taking leuprorelin or histrelin?

228
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,900
I've been leuprorelin for nine months.

229
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,680
Why didn't you say anything earlier?

230
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,970
Because my parents didn't want my grandma to know.

231
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,370
Looks like he has an abscess.

232
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:48,570
You have an infection.

233
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:50,610
We'll drain it, put you on antibiotics.

234
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,520
It's nothing to worry about.

235
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,960
It just means - you might be in the hospital

236
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,950
a couple of extra nights.

237
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:55,820
I -- I can't spend a couple of extra nights.

238
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,100
I need to get out of here.

239
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,390
Are you worried about your kids?

240
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:01,610
Well, they're with my sister, they're safe,

241
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:03,590
but they've never spent a night without me

242
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:04,740
since they were born.

243
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,350
Well, then consider this a blessing.

244
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:07,890
A free vacation from your kids.

245
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:09,270
They're my life.

246
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:16,840
My wife died of ovarian cancer last year.

247
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,010
I...

248
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:23,090
I hate hospitals.

249
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,870
I'm so sorry.

250
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,610
Why don't I find a laptop

251
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:29,200
so you can Skype with them?

252
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:33,040
And I'll rustle up a couple of toy bears from Peds

253
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,190
for you to take home.

254
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:35,470
Thank you.

255
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:40,020
I want to reassure you

256
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,360
that the puberty blockers

257
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:43,880
are in no way responsible for causing cancer.

258
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:46,740
The leuprorelin did cause your osteopenia.

259
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,070
Does this mean I have to stop taking puberty blockers?

260
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:49,950
Yes.

261
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:51,330
We'll get you on dietary supplements

262
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:52,680
to help regain your bone strength,

263
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,230
but the puberty blockers are hurting you.

264
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:55,470
You'll be fine without them.

265
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,380
Fine?

266
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,350
I -- I don't want an Adam's apple

267
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:02,840
or a deep voice - or hair all over my body.

268
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:05,200
You can't reverse that, can you?

269
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,460
No, I'm afraid not.

270
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:18,230
Girls have body hair, too.

271
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,450
Toy bears, Skype with kids --

272
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,930
you've got game.

273
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:32,840
"Game"?

274
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:34,860
I believe the name for what I did

275
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,790
is "Basic human decency."

276
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,330
Everyone has an agenda.

277
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:41,430
Sometimes it's conscious, sometimes it's not,

278
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:42,740
but it's always there.

279
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:46,000
And you've got this whole "Queen of kindness" thing down pat.

280
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,080
Awfully cynical for someone so young.

281
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,080
Mm, not cynical.

282
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,790
Just the reality of how the world works.

283
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,440
It's Howard.

284
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,050
He spiked a fever, temp's 105.

285
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,510
BP's tanking, 80 over 40.

286
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,750
He's soiled his sheets.

287
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,990
Site's clean. Infection should be clearing by now.

288
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,440
- What's going on? - I don't know.

289
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,280
Page Melendez.

290
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,990
Give me 500 milligrams acetaminophen,

291
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:08,080
2 grams of meropenem IV infusion empirically.

292
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,800
Run a chem panel, CBC, and get cultures ASAP.

293
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:12,880
Hang in there, Howard.

294
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,190
We're gonna figure this out.

295
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,030
Any word on Quinn Darby's labs?

296
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:25,150
Big backup today. Nothing much I can do.

297
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,360
Text you when they're ready.

298
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:27,470
Yeah.

299
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:30,250
Hey, Gus.

300
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:32,300
I saw raspberry and rose petal doughnuts

301
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,650
in the cafeteria today.

302
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:34,970
Got you the last one.

303
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:37,230
You remembered.

304
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,390
Thank you.

305
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,090
Howard Shaw's labs.

306
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:42,990
- I put a rush on them for you. - You're the best.

307
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,180
Why did you give Gus a doughnut?

308
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:49,810
I was being nice.

309
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,930
I needed my patient's labs expedited.

310
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:54,290
- Gus likes doughnuts. - It's called bribery.

311
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:56,170
I call it "Basic human decency."

312
00:13:58,090 --> 00:13:59,010
See you later.

313
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,860
Howard has a superbug.

314
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:08,640
A C. Diff infection?

315
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:10,280
It's resistant to all medication.

316
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:15,850
Quinn's pre-op labs are normal,

317
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:17,710
so we can do the surgery first thing in the morning.

318
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:21,300
The procedure is called a radical inguinal orchiectomy.

319
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:26,130
It's radical in that the entire cancerous testicle is removed.

320
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:28,260
All functionality will remain the same.

321
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:31,200
Quinn should be able to resume her normal activities in one or two weeks.

322
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,180
See? Baby, that's good news.

323
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,230
No, not really.

324
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:35,430
Without the puberty blockers,

325
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,810
I'll be the freak in ballet with a mustache.

326
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:39,640
Aren't there any other options?

327
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:40,860
I wish there were --

328
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:43,280
If we do a bilateral orchiectomy,

329
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,910
Quinn will have the testosterone level of a girl.

330
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:48,080
We are not removing both testicles.

331
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,490
You want to castrate my grandson?

332
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:51,450
No.

333
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:54,730
I'm so sorry - for Dr. Murphy's outburst.

334
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,600
I'm gonna have gender confirmation surgery

335
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,900
when I'm 18 anyway.

336
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,330
Why not just do it now.

337
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:05,250
Quinn is a child

338
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:08,830
who still plays dress-up and make-believe.

339
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,960
He may want to have children of his own some day.

340
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:14,660
We'll give you some privacy.

341
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,560
Thank you.

342
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:21,790
I will not allow you --

343
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:22,970
It's not up to you.

344
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,900
You are making me doubt the wisdom of drafting you, Murphy.

345
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:30,130
If you go around saying inflammatory things to people,

346
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,520
it will only upset them.

347
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:34,520
How will I know if I said something inflammatory

348
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,750
until I say it?

349
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:38,210
Test it on Kalu first.

350
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,260
Which you can do while the two of you prep an SDA for this case.

351
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:43,600
An SDA?

352
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,810
A Shared Decision Aid

353
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:47,960
is a paper presenting the pros and cons

354
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:49,830
- of making a difficult -- I know what it is, Murphy.

355
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:51,150
But why am I being punished?

356
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,760
It's not a punishment, it's necessary.

357
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,530
It'll help Quinn's family

358
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:56,300
understand all the options available to them for her care.

359
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,590
Understood?

360
00:15:58,570 --> 00:15:59,380
Understood.

361
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,640
The stool culture and sensitivity test

362
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,070
indicate that you're resistant to every antibiotic.

363
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,770
Which only happens when you've been exposed

364
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:09,730
to every antibiotic.

365
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:12,480
I -- I did this to myself?

366
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,800
But I've used those medications before without a problem.

367
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,270
Why did this happen now?

368
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,830
You weren't under a doctor's care,

369
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:23,950
so you were likely taking the wrong medication

370
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,210
for the wrong symptoms.

371
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:26,580
But you can fix this, right?

372
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:29,100
We're gonna have to perform a colostomy

373
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:32,010
where we attach an ostomy pouching system to your abdomen

374
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:33,540
to collect waste from your body.

375
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,400
For how long?

376
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:36,640
Well, with the level of damage

377
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,940
we're seeing throughout the colon, indefinitely.

378
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,080
I'm so sorry, Howard.

379
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:52,680
I don't understand

380
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,540
why you'd suggest the bilateral orchiectomy

381
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,110
when you don't even believe Quinn's a girl.

382
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:58,610
I was answering Dr. Lim's question.

383
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:00,920
She said there were no other options,

384
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,240
but I found one.

385
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,330
And now we're here.

386
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:05,240
Yes.

387
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,570
You're actually enjoying this scut work, aren't you?

388
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:10,580
Yes. We are being helpful.

389
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,720
We're not doing this to be helpful, Murphy.

390
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,640
We're doing this because you pissed off Lim,

391
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,090
and I'm collateral damage.

392
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,790
We're still being helpful.

393
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:26,710
Doesn't matter.

394
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:29,100
Doesn't matter, competition's over.

395
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:30,570
Is it?

396
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,930
We're in here and not with the patient.

397
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:34,950
No face time plus you calling her a "He"

398
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:36,680
equals crappy survey scores.

399
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,540
It's okay. It's a game.

400
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,700
- It's not important. - It is to me.

401
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,050
I'm a pariah.

402
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:49,320
These scores are part of our resident evaluation.

403
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,630
Our jobs depend on them.

404
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:53,100
Mine does, at least.

405
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:02,590
Then we should do this scut work very well.

406
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,350
Finola called.

407
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:17,060
She found an irregularity with one of the tests

408
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,790
but wants to re-run it to be sure.

409
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:23,160
Okay, so we wait until she re-runs it.

410
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,610
Marcus, we're both doctors.

411
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:28,300
The results aren't gonna change.

412
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:33,230
I waited too long.

413
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:36,440
It's all my fault.

414
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:42,090
This is the part where you say,

415
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:43,420
"No, babe, it isn't."

416
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:46,730
You had goals, other priorities.

417
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:49,920
You said you supported my career choices,

418
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,030
just like I supported yours.

419
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:53,090
I do support you. Always.

420
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,260
And I am so proud of you.

421
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,270
But it came at a cost

422
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:59,000
that we both knew was possible.

423
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:02,110
- We should have started trying sooner. - When?

424
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,450
When you were 3,000 miles away teaching at Dartmouth?

425
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:06,760
Or, what, when you were chasing down head of surgery?

426
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:08,810
- We would have figured it out. - "Figuring it out"

427
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:10,730
would have meant me and a nanny raising a baby.

428
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:11,230
I didn't want that.

429
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:12,750
I tried to bring it up four years ago,

430
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,170
but you wanted to get your practice up and running.

431
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:16,050
A baby didn't fit in that picture, either.

432
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:17,500
It is not the same.

433
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,990
How many pregnant women get hired for anything?

434
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,610
Or when they find out a woman's got a child at home,

435
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:23,900
suddenly it's all "Who's gonna take care of the baby? "

436
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,800
No one asks men that question.

437
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,600
Yeah, well, none of it matters now.

438
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,110
Right? Because it's probably too late.

439
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:30,990
And I knew it.

440
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:32,820
I knew this was gonna happen.

441
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:36,370
You've been stewing over this.

442
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,370
Resenting me. For how long?

443
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:41,540
I don't resent you, Is.

444
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:44,580
But, you know, if you want me to sit here

445
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:47,230
and tell you that it's not your fault,

446
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:50,090
I -- I can't do that, I'm sorry.

447
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:10,200
You like?

448
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,760
That door was locked.

449
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,600
Oh, I know.

450
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,850
The cable guy had a cancellation,

451
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:18,070
so he hooked me up, got us a two-for-one.

452
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:20,530
Little thanks for being so chill earlier.

453
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:22,840
Gracias, amigo.

454
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:31,190
So, what kind of doctor are you?

455
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:35,140
I'm a surgeon.

456
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,270
A surgeon?

457
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,590
Your stuff doesn't say surgeon, does it?

458
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:42,090
It's like, uh, Selena and Justin.

459
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,180
It doesn't really go together.

460
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,620
Furniture's from, like, a dozen different places.

461
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,730
Fourteen.

462
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:50,830
Fourteen.

463
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:54,160
The people in Casper knew I didn't have any money,

464
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,430
so they gave me things to make a home.

465
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:59,220
The bookshelf is from Jennifer,

466
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,920
the town librarian.

467
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:04,900
My table and chairs are from Mr. Grady's diner.

468
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:06,380
The lamp is from Sheryl

469
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,730
who teaches Sunday school at Highland Church.

470
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:10,800
Dr. Glassman, he got me my bed.

471
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,740
Well, you don't have to tell me the whole list, but...

472
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,320
Okay. Yes.

473
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:18,820
Everything I have works.

474
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,900
There is no need to change it.

475
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:21,910
Respect.

476
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,360
I'm Dr. Glassman.

477
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,000
I'm the president of the hospital.

478
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,220
Is everything okay?

479
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,170
Sit down.

480
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:53,520
There has been no change in Quinn's condition.

481
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:58,050
However, her grandmother has made a claim of child abuse

482
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,520
against you and your husband.

483
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:05,430
She's claiming that putting Quinn on puberty blockers --

484
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:07,280
and these are her words,

485
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:11,080
"Making her think that being trans is okay" --

486
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:14,930
is a form of emotional and physical abuse.

487
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:19,160
Now, just to be clear,

488
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,990
we don't believe any of these allegations

489
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:22,260
have any merit whatsoever.

490
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,670
I know my mom, okay?

491
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:25,300
She's not gonna drop this.

492
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,600
She'll go to court.

493
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,160
Could she get custody?

494
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:31,900
Well, she could try, but, uh, Dr. Lim would testify.

495
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:35,340
They could put her in a foster home.

496
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,220
Ty, she won't make it.

497
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:40,230
If we let Quinn do the surgery she wants now,

498
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:41,460
it'll all be over.

499
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:44,220
There will be no reason for Ruth to fight us.

500
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:51,770
Do what Quinn wants.

501
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,910
Do the bilateral surgery.

502
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:03,890
There is an issue.

503
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:09,130
Your tests confirmed abnormalities in the semen parameters.

504
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,720
I beg your pardon?

505
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:14,660
The semen analysis.

506
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:18,050
It showed that you have a low sperm count and low motility.

507
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:19,990
It's my fault?

508
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:20,510
No.

509
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:23,370
We -- we do not speak in terms of fault.

510
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:27,930
15% of all couples struggle with infertility,

511
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:31,250
and of those, 50% have a male factor component.

512
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,060
It's not great news, but it's not a dead end.

513
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,270
So what's the next step?

514
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:39,510
I'm gonna refer you to Dr. Arjun Dhillon.

515
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:40,740
He's an excellent urologist,

516
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:43,030
and he'll give Marcus a -- a full physical,

517
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:45,830
do some blood work, and an ultrasound.

518
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:46,690
That can't be right.

519
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:47,650
- Marcus. - It can't be right.

520
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:49,500
Marcus. We got this.

521
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:50,730
Okay?

522
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,370
We're gonna get through this together.

523
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:03,550
Why didn't you tell me Howard's labs came back?

524
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:05,380
I should have been there when you broke the bad news to him.

525
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,970
So Melendez could see your touching bedside manner.

526
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:09,800
It doesn't matter anyway.

527
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,270
Oh, it doesn't? How the hell not?

528
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:14,760
The poor guy's getting a colostomy.

529
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,070
There's no way we're winning this competition.

530
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:19,810
You really have no sympathy

531
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:21,130
for what Howard's going through?

532
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:22,920
It's a major bummer, no doubt.

533
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,800
But we don't have time to get emotionally invested

534
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,510
in every patient that we treat.

535
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:28,780
Our job is to go in, do the surgery,

536
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:29,820
and get out.

537
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:33,090
Afterwards -- his poop, someone else's poop --

538
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,810
it's not our problem.

539
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:37,140
Hey, well, wait.

540
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,920
What if we could get Howard a fecal microbiota transplant?

541
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,180
FMT for a surgical case?

542
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:46,580
Theoretically, we transfer healthy feces to him,

543
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:48,100
it restores good flora to the body,

544
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:49,340
kills off the CDI,

545
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:51,330
and he avoids surgery all together.

546
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:54,650
We could actually win this thing.

547
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:58,590
I'm gonna pull all the research before pitching it to Melendez.

548
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:03,350
So, this meeting is called

549
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:06,430
a Challenging Patient Consultation Process.

550
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:07,230
The name sucks,

551
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:10,070
but there are things about it I do like.

552
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:14,230
All you got to do is talk and listen

553
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:16,310
and try to understand each other.

554
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:17,580
What's to understand?

555
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,550
Ruth accused us of being child abusers.

556
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:20,920
And what's to discuss?

557
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,230
We are Quinn's parents.

558
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:24,060
We get to make her medical decisions.

559
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,780
What if Quinnie's better off as a boy?

560
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:29,250
You have no idea - what Quinn has been through.

561
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:31,870
Every kid - goes through rough patches.

562
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:33,660
Every kid is confused.

563
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:36,810
Quinn has always told us exactly who she was, ever since she was 3.

564
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:38,460
So you let Quinn play with dolls.

565
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:39,570
Big deal.

566
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:41,570
You don't make life-altering decisions

567
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:44,300
because a child wants to be a princess.

568
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:51,950
We used to let Quinn do whatever she wanted at home.

569
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,040
But when she went out in public,

570
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,910
we made her present as a boy.

571
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:59,960
It felt false to her.

572
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:01,740
She hated it.

573
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,550
She hated herself.

574
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:06,890
She became reclusive, depressed.

575
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:10,050
And then a year ago, Quinn tried to kill herself.

576
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:17,600
Sorry I'm late.

577
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,520
Howard might not need the colostomy

578
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,510
if we give him - a fecal microbiota transplant.

579
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,370
Hasn't the FDA gone back and forth on that?

580
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:39,800
We could be introducing new bacteria into his system

581
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,510
that could kill him.

582
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:41,980
The likelihood of that is low.

583
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:42,740
But not zero.

584
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,420
But if we do the colostomy,

585
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:45,840
we may not really be helping him.

586
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:48,870
15% to 30% of patients get recurrent CDI

587
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:49,870
after the initial bout.

588
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:51,080
That's a good point.

589
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,690
I believe 65% of that time,

590
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:54,300
recurrent CDI becomes chronic,

591
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,800
which can lead to repeated hospitalizations and death.

592
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:01,130
Are my numbers right, Claire?

593
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,220
Yes.

594
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,630
But recent studies

595
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:08,740
show better than - a 95% success rate with FMTs.

596
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:10,580
Howard is a good candidate.

597
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:13,160
We should try it before he develops a toxic megacolon.

598
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,360
Don't we owe it to him, to his twins,

599
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,480
to at least try an experimental treatment

600
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,080
before doing an invasive surgery

601
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,730
which will alter his life forever?

602
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:22,350
You're right.

603
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,820
Prep him for the procedure.

604
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:27,110
I appreciate your passionate advocacy for your patient.

605
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,500
Good work, both of you.

606
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,720
Now you're a team player.

607
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,170
When it benefits me, yes.

608
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:37,960
Speaking of which, while you were doing your research,

609
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,570
I found Howard a match at the stool bank.

610
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:41,220
Sample arrives in a couple of hours.

611
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:41,720
Great.

612
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,630
I let them know you'd be the designated doctor

613
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:45,090
to handle the medical chain of custody

614
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:46,520
when the sample arrives.

615
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,020
So...?

616
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,860
So you're the only person who can handle the sample.

617
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:53,490
You'll have to dilute it, blend it, strain it all on your own.

618
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:55,950
To safeguard against cross-contamination, of course.

619
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,570
Of course.

620
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:09,290
Your temperature and BP are normal.

621
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:11,090
Normal. Whatever that means.

622
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:14,130
Typical. Usual.

623
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:16,080
Expected.

624
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:18,530
Yeah, I don't feel like any of those things.

625
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:21,870
What does it feel like to be a girl?

626
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,830
Are you angry?

627
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,830
Was that an inflammatory question?

628
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:31,090
I'd rather people ask questions

629
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:32,930
instead of pointing and staring.

630
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:36,610
When I used to look like a boy,

631
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,410
I felt...different.

632
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:42,490
The kids at school didn't understand me,

633
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:43,820
so they picked on me.

634
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,940
I spent a lot of time alone.

635
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,330
When my parents let me be me,

636
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,100
I felt...

637
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:55,010
like I didn't - have to pretend anymore.

638
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:59,420
I felt free, like when you're in a pool

639
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:01,200
and you just let go and float.

640
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:07,840
I'm not a very good swimmer.

641
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:20,080
I don't know what it feels like

642
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:22,330
to be anyone but me.

643
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,090
Me, too.

644
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:33,210
Is the bilateral more risky than the unilateral surgery?

645
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:34,960
The big issue with the bilateral

646
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,660
is Quinn will never be able to have biological children.

647
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:39,930
If Quinn's parents think that Quinn's mature enough

648
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:41,270
and strong enough in her beliefs,

649
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,360
then they should do it now.

650
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:45,390
It's an elective surgery on a child.

651
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:47,010
There is no medical necessity.

652
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:49,060
Except with - a previous suicide attempt,

653
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,040
she's still at risk.

654
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,600
Her situation is different now.

655
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,520
She's socially transitioned and living as a girl.

656
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:56,750
But there just isn't enough good data

657
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:58,040
on trans kids and their outcomes.

658
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,800
On the other hand, there's very good reason

659
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,490
to preserve future fertility.

660
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:04,010
Dr. Lim and Dr. Andrews

661
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,840
are both very excellent surgeons,

662
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,430
and they very clearly have some passionate points of view,

663
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:09,700
but their views are their own.

664
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:13,340
You all need to decide what's best for Quinn.

665
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:16,100
Whatever we decide,

666
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,030
Quinn is still gonna be a girl.

667
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,460
I don't know if I'll ever be able to accept that.

668
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:27,840
I know that makes me sound horrible.

669
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:31,870
I know what it's like to not put your family first,

670
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,200
and it cost me.

671
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,140
It cost me a great deal.

672
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:40,790
And if I had to do it all over again,

673
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:41,920
I'd ask myself --

674
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,560
is it really worth sacrificing a life

675
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:50,920
with someone I love over an idea that may never be?

676
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:57,840
Why don't we give them the room?

677
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:08,270
I got the page. What's going on.

678
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:10,350
She started screaming in pain and vomiting.

679
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:11,240
Temp's 104.

680
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:14,300
Increased groin pain could be attributed to epididymitis,

681
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,960
kidney stones, inguinal hernia...

682
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:16,980
The extra weight of the tumor

683
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:19,050
could be causing the testicle to twist on itself.

684
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:21,590
There'd be no blood flow.

685
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:29,340
She has a testicular torsion.

686
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:30,440
She needs surgery now.

687
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,020
Excuse me. Have you made a decision?

688
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,900
Not yet. - I mean, there's a lot to --

689
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,250
We need one now.

690
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:45,170
Quinn has testicular torsion.

691
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,920
The spermatic cord is twisted

692
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,130
and cutting off blood supply.

693
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:49,100
We need to operate.

694
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:55,640
If you want Quinn to live the way she wants,

695
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:58,070
don't limit her future now.

696
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,800
You heard her when my mom said

697
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,380
she might want kids some day.

698
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:05,060
She can't even fathom the thought

699
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:07,690
because she's just a child.

700
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:15,440
Just do what's medically necessary.

701
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:26,910
Doesn't appear to be any palpable lymphadenopathy.

702
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:29,770
It's likely a stromal tumor,

703
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:31,520
but get that to pathology right away.

704
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,340
Yes, sir.

705
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:39,890
Quinn has tachycardia and hypotension.

706
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,050
I'm not seeing any bleeding.

707
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:43,870
EKG's normal. It's not coronary.

708
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,150
CO2 and O2 are normal, so it's not a P.E.

709
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:47,810
It must be a reaction to the anesthesia.

710
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:50,380
I'm already pushing fluids and vasoconstrictors.

711
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:01,100
Six syringes in, and no sign of leakage.

712
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,510
Okay, we're wrapped up here.

713
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:04,520
Let's get Howard into recovery.

714
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:06,100
- Well done. - Thanks.

715
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,010
I was thinking of writing up the procedure,

716
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:10,890
possibly submit it for publication.

717
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,800
I'd be happy to assist,

718
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,560
seeing as I've done it before.

719
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:16,440
Thanks, but I think I can --

720
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,730
I read your paper in AMSURG, Dr. Reznick.

721
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:20,210
You continue to impress.

722
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:23,090
Coming from you, I take that as a huge compliment.

723
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:26,090
When you get a chance, Dr. Browne,

724
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,550
you should read it.

725
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:28,750
Will do.

726
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,500
I've given vasopressors

727
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,600
and reduced her meds as much as I can.

728
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:41,900
She's losing volume somewhere.

729
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:44,380
It was dry when we ligated the spermatic cord.

730
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,260
I'm still not seeing the bleed.

731
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:48,450
Could be vagal stimulation from the severed nerve.

732
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:49,670
But she's not responding to epi.

733
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:52,060
- Sepsis? - It's too early for an infection.

734
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:56,110
Her MAP is 20. She's barely profusing.

735
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,430
Okay, excuse me, guys.

736
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,270
- You're breaking scrub. - I'm so sorry.

737
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:04,340
Grey-Turner sign.

738
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:06,700
Could be a retroperitoneal hemorrhage.

739
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:20,340
Jared could be right.

740
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:23,840
It is possible that there's internal bleeding.

741
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:27,650
The testicular artery can retract up into the pelvis.

742
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:29,720
It's rare, but it can happen.

743
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:32,190
Rare is an understatement. Dr. Andrews?

744
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:36,410
I don't think we have any other choice.

745
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:38,190
We need to do an ex-lap. 10 blade.

746
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,330
Murphy, retract.

747
00:34:57,370 --> 00:34:58,900
Internal bleeding.

748
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,380
Jared was right.

749
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,660
Nice call, Dr. Kalu.

750
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:04,580
Thank you, sir.

751
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:06,510
Kalu, suction.

752
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:08,020
We need a clear view of the field.

753
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:17,460
Fever's down, and the flora in your system seems to be returning to normal.

754
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:21,310
- We expect a full recovery. - Thank you. For everything.

755
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,420
Do you know when I can have visitors?

756
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:25,280
I thought you might ask that question.

757
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,480
There are a couple of eager preschoolers who'd like to say hi.

758
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:32,260
- Daddy! - Keira! Sammy!

759
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:36,620
I think you guys have grown!

760
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:40,230
These are the doctors that saved Daddy.

761
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,740
Dr. Reznick and this is, uh...

762
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:45,670
I'm sorry, I forgot your name.

763
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,490
Dr. Browne.

764
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:49,710
- Thank you. - Thank you.

765
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,430
You're welcome.

766
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:56,660
Okay.

767
00:35:59,140 --> 00:35:59,880
Who's this guy?

768
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,440
- Bear Bear. - Bear Bear?

769
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,460
Did you do it?

770
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,090
Did you remove both?

771
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:15,110
No.

772
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:16,690
Just the cancerous one.

773
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:18,550
What? Why not?

774
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:20,780
That's on me.

775
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:23,470
I couldn't, in good conscience, remove a healthy organ.

776
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,590
Quinnie.

777
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:31,270
This was our decision.

778
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:33,250
No! You said you were on my side!

779
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:35,920
Hey, we are. Always.

780
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,970
We haven't had enough time to talk,

781
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:40,700
not with each other, with your therapist,

782
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:41,940
with your doctors.

783
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,840
So I'm gonna turn into a boy.

784
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,480
Well, not right away.

785
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:47,310
Your endocrinologist will talk to you

786
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:50,350
about the right timeline for starting feminizing hormones.

787
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:54,140
You know...

788
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:58,420
the thought of having your own kids someday

789
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:59,720
is a big decision,

790
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:03,150
but you never know what you will or will not want once you get older.

791
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:06,750
Cis people are always so worked up about having bio kids.

792
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:08,120
If I really want a kid that bad,

793
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,040
I can just adopt.

794
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,580
You know, I'll be back when I'm 18

795
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,700
for my gender confirmation surgery.

796
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:20,590
And when you do, I'll be here to help you.

797
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:30,220
Patient satisfaction survey scores are in,

798
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:31,980
and it was very close.

799
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,770
Not really. She's being kind.

800
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:37,610
Congratulations go to Dr. Reznick and Dr. Browne.

801
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:39,460
- Yes. - Thank you.

802
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:42,500
Congratulations.

803
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,570
Thank you, Shaun.

804
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:45,350
Claire and I make a nice team.

805
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,330
You should be psyched.

806
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,540
Yeah. I should be.

807
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:57,720
To the victor belong the spoils.

808
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,110
Pay up.

809
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:02,080
Humility was never your strong suit.

810
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,890
Thank you, Mortimer.

811
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,850
Don't spend it all in one place.

812
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,350
Spend it?

813
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:10,940
I'm gonna frame it.

814
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,630
What made you think of a retroperitoneal hemorrhage?

815
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:16,570
Homework.

816
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:17,470
You were right.

817
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:19,500
Prepping for an SDA was important.

818
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:21,140
We make a good team.

819
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:27,010
Quinn doesn't like pink.

820
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:29,880
I think she will like these.

821
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,180
I hope so.

822
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:37,650
She's more of a purple girl.

823
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:47,590
Did you read Morgan's AMSURG article yet?

824
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,100
It is on the top of my to-do list.

825
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,350
I didn't tell you to read it to rub it in.

826
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:58,040
I told you to read it so you knew what you'd be up against.

827
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,960
You think I need to be more cutthroat?

828
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:03,000
No. That's Morgan's M.O. You're different.

829
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:05,430
You're smart, you're special.

830
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,920
Rise up, play the game on your own terms.

831
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:11,110
Don't wait for it.

832
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:18,000
{\an1}BGM: Rivers And Roads by The Head And The Heart

833
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:16,620
{\an9}* A year from now we'll all be gone *

834
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:20,900
{\an9}* All our friends will move away *

835
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:27,130
{\an9}* And they're goin' to better places *

836
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:31,980
{\an9}* But our friends will be gone away *

837
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:38,980
{\an9}* Nothin' is as it has been *

838
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,660
I heard you saved Quinn's life.

839
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:44,340
Jared and I did.

840
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:46,020
I like her.

841
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:47,220
"Her."

842
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,450
{\an9}* And I guess it's just as well *

843
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:51,850
So you get that she is a "She."

844
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,660
I have lots of questions.

845
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,680
Yeah, well, questions are good.

846
00:39:58,410 --> 00:40:00,900
Leads to awareness and understanding.

847
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:04,090
And, who knows, maybe even acceptance.

848
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,910
Being a kid is tough enough,

849
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:09,150
But being a trans kid? Oh, man, that's --

850
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:11,050
that's off the chart.

851
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:15,550
I can't imagine how it must feel

852
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:18,970
to be so different on the outside

853
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:20,480
than you are on the inside.

854
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:29,080
Hey, Shaun.

855
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,700
I can give you a lift.

856
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:33,320
We could grab a bite.

857
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,360
You said you can't be my friend.

858
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:40,870
So, no, thank you.

859
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,200
{\an9}* Been talking 'bout *

860
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,980
{\an9}* The way things change *

861
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:47,430
Okay.

862
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:55,560
{\an9}* If you don't know what to make of this *

863
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:57,150
Hey, amigo. What's up?

864
00:40:56,360 --> 00:41:00,520
{\an9}* Then we will not relate *

865
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,330
I need your help.

866
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:04,990
{\an9}* Rivers and roads *

867
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:07,710
{\an9}* Rivers and roads *

868
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:12,320
{\an9}* Rivers till I reach you *

869
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,690
{\an9}* Rivers and roads *

870
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:18,200
{\an9}* Oh, rivers and roads *

871
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:22,620
{\an9}* Oh, rivers till I reach you *

872
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:26,770
{\an9}* Rivers and roads *

873
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:29,320
{\an9}* Rivers and roads *

874
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:33,050
{\an9}* Rivers till I reach you *

875
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,220
{\an9}* Rivers and roads *

876
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:39,690
{\an9}* Rivers and roads *

877
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:43,690
{\an9}* Rivers till I reach you *

878
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,430
You're not gonna do any laps or nothing?

879
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:48,580
No.

880
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,890
Then what are you doing?

881
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,080
Understanding.

882
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:04,890
{\an9}* Rivers and roads *

883
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:07,630
{\an9}* Rivers and roads *

884
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:12,250
{\an9}* Rivers till I reach you *
