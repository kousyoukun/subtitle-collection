1
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,200
早上好  医生
Morning, doc!

2
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,190
早上好  肯尼
Good morning, Kenny.

3
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:24,520
兄弟  你的电缆断了
Brosef, your cable's out.

4
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:26,960
我没用电缆
I don't have cable.

5
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,930
我用的数字天线
I have a digital antenna.

6
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:29,460
为什么
Why?

7
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:35,520
数字天线的画面和音效都更胜一筹
Digital antennae receive superior picture and sound quality,

8
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:37,290
电视台都不要钱
and the channels are free.

9
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:38,870
对  但那样只能收到十个台
Yeah, but you get, like, 10 channels that way.

10
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:40,580
我只看三个台
I only watch three.

11
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:42,560
能让我从你的电视上搭根线吗
You mind if I run a line to your tube?

12
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:45,500
有线电视的人下周才给我开通信号
Cable guy can't fit me in till next week.

13
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,020
能看十个台总比没台好
Come on, 10 channels are better than none.

14
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,410
确实
Yes, they are.

15
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:52,280
好了
All right.

16
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,940
谢了  朋友
Gracias, amigo.

17
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,060
不客气
No hay na que agradecer.

18
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:56,740
什么
What?

19
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:03,690
科利医生走后  雷兹尼克医生就没人带了
Dr. Reznick was orphaned once Dr. Coyle was transferred,

20
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,100
她会加入我们的团队
so she'll be joining our team.

21
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,730
你好  我是克莱尔
Hi. I'm Claire.

22
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:07,770
很高兴认识你
Nice to meet you.

23
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,300
你就是有自闭症的那位
Are you the autistic one?

24
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:12,240
不
No.

25
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:13,940
是我
That's me.

26
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,700
肖恩·莫菲医生
Dr. Shaun Murphy.

27
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,820
我们手上有两个很简单的病例
We've got two pretty straightforward cases,

28
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,860
积极的团队就该公平竞争
nice level playing field for an eager group.

29
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:23,830
没兴趣
Not interested.

30
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:26,060
竞争能促进团队合作
Competition can foster teamwork,

31
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,590
而团队合作有助于
which can lead to a greater understanding

32
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:30,650
更好地摸清和评估住院医师的优缺点
and appreciation of residents' strengths and weaknesses

33
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:32,250
提高病患治疗水平
and improve patient care.

34
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,130
我们在实习时  格拉斯曼用过同样的招数
You're playing the same game Glassman had us do when we were interns.

35
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:36,060
没兴趣
Not interested.

36
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,970
获胜的队伍优先协助
Winning team gets first dibs

37
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:40,130
下周所有的手术
on assisting on all surgeries next week.

38
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:40,950
-同意  -同意
- In. - In.

39
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:41,750
拒绝
Out.

40
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,880
我选天才小子
I pick the boy genius.

41
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:53,470
是你
That's you.

Hi, Quinn.

66
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,800
听说你肚子疼
We hear you've had some stomach pain.

67
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,980
我们可以检查一下吗
Do you mind if we take a look?

68
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,400
没那么疼
It doesn't hurt that bad.

小家伙一直说没事
Poor thing says everything is okay,

71
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,910
奎妮今天说不想去游泳
but when Quinnie didn't want to go swimming today,

72
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:38,180
我就知道肯定出问题了
I knew that something must be wrong.

73
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,170
我们会尽量轻一点
We'll be as gentle with her as possible.

74
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:45,200
奎因的父母出远门了
Quinn's parents are out of town,

75
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,130
所以临时叫我来照看
so I'm -- I flew in to babysit.

76
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:53,890
好
Okay.

77
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,000
我看看
Let's see.

78
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:00,770
-那是  -阴茎
- That's a... - Penis.

79
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,060
她不是女孩
She's not a girl.

80
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,040
他是个男孩
He's a boy.

It's just a phase.

84
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,120
别那么说
Stop saying that.

85
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,710
我不是男孩  我是女孩
I'm not a boy. I'm a girl.

86
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,630
-你是跨性别者  -对
- You're transgender? - Yes.

87
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,230
不
No.

88
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,670
奎因有跟我和杰瑞德一样的XY染色体
Quinn has XY chromosomes like Jared and me,

89
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:27,200
不是你的XX染色体
not XX like you.

90
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,040
科学上来说他是男性
Science says he's male.

91
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,480
不  奎因有性別不安症
No, Quinn has gender dysphoria.

92
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,220
她认知的性别跟实际性别不符
Her assigned gender is not the one she identifies with.

93
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,830
是不匹配  莫菲医生
She's mismatched, Dr. Murphy.

94
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:36,940
但生物学上...
But biologically --

95
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,370
撇开生物学
Other than biologically,

96
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:40,380
你怎么知道自己应该是男孩
how do you know - you're supposed to be a boy?

97
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,670
你的问题说不通
Your question doesn't make sense.

98
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:46,440
我不是应该是什么
I'm not supposed to be anything.

99
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,630
我就是男孩
I am a boy.

100
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,510
生物学规定的
Biologically, that's it.

101
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,900
好  麦氏点有深压痛
Okay, deep tenderness at McBurney's point.

102
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,480
可能是急性阑尾炎
Could be acute appendicitis.

103
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,900
莫菲  做影像学检查确认
Murphy, get imaging to confirm.

104
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:10,190
肖先生  病历显示你在上课时晕倒了
Mr. Shaw, your chart says that you passed out in class.

105
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,930
-你教什么  -历史
- What do you teach? - History.

106
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:14,240
我没吃早饭  所以有点晕
I got a little dizzy because I skipped breakfast.

107
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,280
没事
I-it's nothing.

108
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,570
学校坚持要叫救护车
The school insisted on calling an ambulance.

109
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,270
最近几个月有吃什么药吗
Taken any medications in the last few months?

110
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:22,940
六周前背突然很痛
Uh, I took some Vicodin

111
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,410
我就吃了点维柯丁[止痛药]
after I threw out my back six weeks ago,

112
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,010
之后又得了肠胃感冒  就吃了氧氟沙星
and then I had a stomach flu, so I took Ofloxacin.

113
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:31,170
但感冒没全治好
But the flu part didn't totally go away,

114
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:34,530
又吃了阿奇霉素和强的松
so I took Azithromycin and Prednisone

115
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:36,300
因为腺体肿了
because my glands were swollen.

116
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,140
但我的喉咙还很痛  所以吃了环丙沙星
But I still had a sore throat, so I took some Cipro.

117
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:43,370
哪个医生给你开的这些药
What doctor prescribed you all that?

118
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:46,870
都是我药柜里剩下的
Uh, they were leftovers I had in my medicine cabinet.

119
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:49,750
好  请躺下
All right, lay back for me.

120
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,630
我是带着双胞胎的单身父亲
Look, I'm a single dad with twins

121
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:58,760
他们会把在学校接触到的可怕细菌带回家里
who bring home every disgusting germ they touch at preschool.

122
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:00,910
我不上班就没收入
I can't afford to miss work.

123
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,270
你发烧了  还输过两次液
You've got a fever and you've gone through two IVs

124
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:07,320
所以我判断你严重脱水了
which tells me that you're severely dehydrated.

125
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,310
我摸你的胃部时  你会有绞痛感
You can't stand me touching your stomach without wincing in pain.

126
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,290
雷兹尼克医生  给肖先生做超声波
Dr. Reznick, let's get Mr. Shaw here an ultrasound.

127
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,210
-我们试了一段时间  -五个月
- We've been trying for while. - Five months.

128
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:19,530
我的最佳排卵期是二十年前
I realize my prime egg days were two decades ago,

129
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:20,700
但我一直很注意
but I've been vigilant.

130
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,140
试过排卵试纸  促黄体生成素和促卵泡激素测试
Ovulation kits, LH and FSH testing,

131
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,060
基础体温
basal body temp.

132
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,480
也检查过雌二醇和抗穆勒氏荷尔蒙水平
I've checked my estradiol and AMH levels.

133
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,540
传统方法没用
The old-fashioned way wasn't working.

134
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:31,390
好  有很多种可能
Okay, well, there are a lot of possibilities to consider.

135
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:34,700
很多是良性的  很多容易治疗
Many benign, many easily corrected.

136
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,850
我会给你俩采个样
So I will take some samples from you both,

137
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:38,380
做测试  到时再说
run some tests, we go from there.

138
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,360
时间紧迫
There's a clock.

139
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,820
我们想知道如果做人工授精或试管受精
We need to know - if we start with IUI or IVF...

140
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,480
你们俩不用担心
Both of you -- you need to stop worrying.

141
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:47,640
伊莎贝尔  你不是第一个来这问这些的
Isabel, you are not the first 40-something woman

142
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,500
四十几岁的女人
to come here and ask these questions.

143
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:51,010
我也如此
Myself included.

144
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:54,350
你们来找我  是因为相信我吧
You came to me - because you trust me, yes?

145
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,980
对  按照我的程序来
Right. So let me do what I do,

146
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,020
你们专注彼此就行
and you two focus on each other.

147
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:03,580
我们有彼此  宝贝
We're a team, babe.

148
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,120
共同面对  好吗
In this together, all right?

149
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:06,970
好
Okay.

150
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,790
霍华德  你的阑尾恐怕已经破裂了
I'm afraid, Howard, your appendix has already ruptured.

151
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:22,950
立刻安排手术室  呼叫梅伦德斯
Book an OR stat and page Melendez.

152
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:25,290
等等  我得想想谁来照顾我的孩子
Wait. I need to figure out who's gonna take care of my kids,

153
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:27,470
还要通知学校找人给我代课
call the school so they can get subs for my classes.

154
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,810
肖先生  如果现在不做手术
Mr. Shaw, if we don't get you into surgery now,

155
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:32,100
感染会扩散  你会感染性休克
your infection could spread and you could become septic.

156
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,270
布朗医生会打电话通知到相关人员
Dr. Browne will make all the necessary phone calls

157
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,750
我给你准备手术
while I prep you for surgery.

158
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,320
对吧  布朗医生
Isn't that so, Dr. Browne?

159
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,090
我们会照顾好你的  肖先生
You're in good hands, Mr. Shaw.

160
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:42,270
交给我们吧
We've got you covered.

161
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,160
走
Let's go.

162
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:52,270
你好
Hello.

163
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:54,150
你穿裙子吗
Do you wear dresses?

164
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:56,310
莫菲  闭嘴
Murphy, don't.

165
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:59,440
奎因是自认为是女孩的男孩
Quinn is a boy who thinks he's a girl.

166
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,370
我想知道他那样认为的原因
I want to know why he thinks that.

167
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:04,170
我有时穿裙子  有时穿紧身裤
Sometimes I wear dresses, but sometimes I wear leggings.

168
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:07,390
你喜欢粉色吗
Do you like the color pink?

169
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,520
我更喜欢紫色
I'm more of a purple girl.

170
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,500
-你玩娃娃吗  -从五岁起  我就超迷美人鱼
- Do you play with dolls? - Since I was 5, but I'm super into mermaids.

171
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,190
你上舞蹈...
Do you take dance --

172
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:16,380
用于练习推理和创造力的问话游戏

173
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:16,380
莫菲  到「二十问」了
Murphy, 20 questions are up.

174
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,910
我才问了四个
I only asked four.

175
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:18,970
-你喷香水吗  -无关紧要
- Do you wear perfume? - It doesn't matter.

176
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:19,670
CT准备好了  走吧
The CT's ready. Let's go.

177
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:22,040
-你总会涂指甲吗  -走吧
- Do you always paint your nails? - Let's go.

178
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,290
穿孔的阑尾取出来了
Perforated appendix is out.

179
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,260
清洗还是不清洗
Lavage or no lavage.

180
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,180
布朗医生
Dr. Browne.

181
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,350
伤口缝合前清洗
Lavage before closing the wound

182
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,420
会降低残余的积液
decreases residual fluid accumulation

183
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:44,430
-减少残余污染  -克莱尔说得对
- and minimizes residual contamination. - Claire's right.

184
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,080
但最近研究指出穿孔阑尾炎手术进行了冲洗
Although, a recent study documented a higher abscess rate

185
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,890
脓肿的几率会更高
when irrigation was used for perforated appendicitis.

186
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,290
有人做功课了
Well, someone did their homework.

187
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,840
自从《美国外科学》发表了我的论文后
I'm partial to AMSURG

188
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,040
我就很爱看了
since they published me.

189
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:55,770
以医学生的身份
As a medical student?

190
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:58,140
是关于经导管主动脉瓣置换手术
It was about the cost and stabilization of disease

191
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,920
主动脉瓣置换手术
in patients undergoing transcatheter

192
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,670
费用和稳定病情的论文
and surgical aortic valve replacement.

193
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:03,930
你想专门从事心胸外科吗
Are you thinking of specializing in cardio-thoracic?

194
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:05,170
女生总可以幻想一下吧
A girl can dream.

195
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:08,000
进行缝合吧
Staple up and close up.

196
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,310
其实
It's, uh --

197
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:14,190
你能加入我很开心  摩根
it's good to have you on board, Morgan.

198
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,930
能有另一位外科女医生真好
It's great to have another female surgeon.

199
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:20,960
对不起
I'm sorry,

200
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,100
我们做不成朋友
you and I are not gonna be friends,

201
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,950
一起出去玩  一起过夜
hanging out, having sleepovers,

202
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,450
互相编辫子
braiding each other's hair.

203
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:29,580
我其实并没有这个意思
That's not exactly - where I was going with it.

204
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:30,570
等实习期结束
When residency's over,

205
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:32,660
医院可能只会在我们中留下两人
the hospital's likely only keeping two of us.

206
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:35,280
肖恩有格拉斯曼的喜爱  他肯定进
Shaun is Glassman's pet project, so he's in.

207
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,660
杰瑞德不受欢迎  他肯定出局
Jared is persona non grata, so he's out.

208
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,940
这意味每次你胜利了我就会输
Which means every time you win, I lose.

209
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:41,090
反之亦然
And vice versa.

210
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,590
感谢提醒
Thanks for the heads up.

211
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:01,560
你认为他是复杂还是困惑呢
Do you think he's complicated or confused?

212
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,890
兄弟  别再称呼她为「他」
Dude, you've got to quit calling her a "He."

213
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:06,270
如果你不尊敬我们的病人
We're never going to win this competition

214
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,740
我们永远没法成功
with you disrespecting our patient.

215
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,080
-在怀俄明州没有变性人吗  -好吧
- Don't they have transgender people in Wyoming? - Okay.

216
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,430
治疗变性人
Transgender patient care

217
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:15,740
不在我上的医学院授课范围内
was not part of my - medical school curriculum.

218
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,130
你学过吗
Was it part of yours?

219
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,120
没有
No.

220
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,530
奎因没有阑尾炎
Quinn doesn't have appendicitis.

221
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,500
他有睾丸癌
He has testicular cancer.

222
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,500
她
She.

223
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:42,250
我们在奎因左侧睾丸上发现一个肿瘤
We found a mass on Quinn's left testicle.

224
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,720
她得了癌症  但是
She has cancer, but --

225
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,220
-我要死了吗  -不会
- Am I gonna die? - No, no.

226
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,620
预后情况很好
Prognosis is very good.

227
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,890
我们在它扩散前发现了它
We've caught it before it spread,

228
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:49,950
我们通过手术移除肿瘤
and we'll do surgery on the mass to remove it.

229
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:53,260
CT也显示出他骨质缺乏
The CT also showed he has osteopenia.

230
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,090
莫菲  不许再说「他」
Murphy, stop with the "He."

231
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,230
奎妮  是你妈妈
Quinnie, it's your mom.

232
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,330
我得去...
I -- I have to --

233
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,290
当然
Of course.

234
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:05,350
骨质缺乏
Osteopenia.

235
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:07,540
-指骨密度低是吗  -是的
- That's low bone density, right? - Yeah.

236
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:08,840
你怎么会知道
How'd you know that?

237
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,290
你知道我为什么会得癌症吗
Do you know how I got cancer?

238
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,770
有几个可能原因  但是我...
There are several - possible causes, but I --

239
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:15,600
-微石症腮腺炎尿道下裂  -莫菲
- Microlithiasis, mumps, hypospadias -- - Murphy.

240
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,840
上皮生殖细胞肿瘤
Intraepithelial germ cell neoplasia,

241
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,240
腹股沟疝  艾滋病
inguinal hernia, HIV --

242
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,350
莫菲  够了
Murphy. Enough.

243
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,950
你的父母马上就来了
Your parents are on their way here.

244
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,900
他们刚告诉我
Um, they just told me --

245
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:28,700
奎因你在服用发育阻断剂吗
Quinn, are you on puberty blockers?

246
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:33,140
这是骨质缺乏的可能原因
That's the likely cause of the osteopenia.

247
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,590
你在服用亮丙瑞林或组胺瑞林吗
Are you taking leuprorelin or histrelin?

248
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:37,910
我服用亮丙瑞林九个月了
I've been leuprorelin for nine months.

249
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,690
你怎么不早说
Why didn't you say anything earlier?

250
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:42,980
因为我父母不想让我奶奶知道
Because my parents didn't want my grandma to know.

251
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:49,380
看起来他有个脓肿
Looks like he has an abscess.

252
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,580
你被感染了
You have an infection.

253
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,620
我们会弄掉它  给你服用抗生素
We'll drain it, put you on antibiotics.

254
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,530
不用担心
It's nothing to worry about.

255
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:54,970
只是你得在医院
It just means - you might be in the hospital

256
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:55,960
多待几个晚上
a couple of extra nights.

257
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,830
我不能多待几个晚上
I -- I can't spend a couple of extra nights.

258
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,110
我得出去
I need to get out of here.

259
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:01,400
你是担心自己的孩子吗
Are you worried about your kids?

260
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,620
他们和我姐姐在一起  很安全
Well, they're with my sister, they're safe,

261
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,600
但他们从没离开过我一晚
but they've never spent a night without me

262
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,750
自从他们出生后
since they were born.

263
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,360
那把这次当作是赐福吧
Well, then consider this a blessing.

264
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,900
没有孩子  给自己放个假
A free vacation from your kids.

265
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,280
他们是我的生命
They're my life.

266
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:18,850
我妻子去年死于卵巢癌
My wife died of ovarian cancer last year.

267
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,020
我
I...

268
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,100
我讨厌医院
I hate hospitals.

269
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:26,880
真对不起
I'm so sorry.

270
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:29,620
不然我找个电脑过来
Why don't I find a laptop

271
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,210
你可以和孩子们视频
so you can Skype with them?

272
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:35,050
我再从小儿科弄几个玩具熊来
And I'll rustle up a couple of toy bears from Peds

273
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:36,200
给你带回家
for you to take home.

274
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,480
谢谢你
Thank you.

275
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,030
我得提醒你
I want to reassure you

276
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:43,370
发育阻断剂
that the puberty blockers

277
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,890
不会导致你的癌症
are in no way responsible for causing cancer.

278
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,750
亮丙瑞林确实导致了你的骨质缺乏
The leuprorelin did cause your osteopenia.

279
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,080
意思是我不能再服用发育阻断剂了吗
Does this mean I have to stop taking puberty blockers?

280
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,960
是的
Yes.

281
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,340
我们会给你膳食补充剂
We'll get you on dietary supplements

282
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,690
帮助增强你的骨质
to help regain your bone strength,

283
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:56,240
但是发育阻断剂在伤害你
but the puberty blockers are hurting you.

284
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,480
没有它们你会好起来的
You'll be fine without them.

285
00:11:58,590 --> 00:11:59,390
会好的
Fine?

286
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:02,360
我不想要喉结
I -- I don't want an Adam's apple

287
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,850
低沉的嗓音和全身长毛
or a deep voice - or hair all over my body.

288
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,210
你们不能让这些再发生  对吧
You can't reverse that, can you?

289
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,470
恐怕不行
No, I'm afraid not.

290
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,240
女孩子也会有体毛
Girls have body hair, too.

291
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:31,460
玩具熊  和孩子视频
Toy bears, Skype with kids --

292
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,940
你很上道
you've got game.

293
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:34,850
「上道」
"Game"?

294
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,870
我相信我的所作所为
I believe the name for what I did

295
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,800
叫作「基本品格」
is "Basic human decency."

296
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,340
每个人都有目的
Everyone has an agenda.

297
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,440
有时是有意的  有时不是
Sometimes it's conscious, sometimes it's not,

298
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,750
但它一直存在
but it's always there.

299
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,010
而「仁慈之母」是你的常态
And you've got this whole "Queen of kindness" thing down pat.

300
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:50,090
这么年轻就如此愤世嫉俗
Awfully cynical for someone so young.

301
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:51,090
并不是愤世嫉俗
Mm, not cynical.

302
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:52,800
这只是世界运作的现实
Just the reality of how the world works.

303
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:55,450
是霍华德
It's Howard.

304
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:59,060
他突发高烧  40℃
He spiked a fever, temp's 105.

305
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,520
血压急速下降  80/40
BP's tanking, 80 over 40.

306
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,760
床单脏了
He's soiled his sheets.

307
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,000
伤口很干净  感染现在应该结束了
Site's clean. Infection should be clearing by now.

308
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,450
-怎么回事  -我不知道
- What's going on? - I don't know.

309
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:06,290
呼叫梅伦德斯
Page Melendez.

310
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:08,000
给我五百毫克的扑热息痛
Give me 500 milligrams acetaminophen,

311
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,090
两克美罗培南静脉注射
2 grams of meropenem IV infusion empirically.

312
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:12,810
做血液化验和全血细胞计数马上送去培养
Run a chem panel, CBC, and get cultures ASAP.

313
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,890
撑住  霍华德
Hang in there, Howard.

314
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:16,200
我们会弄明白的
We're gonna figure this out.

315
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,000
奎因·达比的化验出结果了吗
Any word on Quinn Darby's labs?

316
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,120
今天太忙了  我无能为力
Big backup today. Nothing much I can do.

317
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,330
好了给你发短信
Text you when they're ready.

318
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,440
好的
Yeah.

319
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,220
你好  格斯
Hey, Gus.

320
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,270
我今天在自助餐厅看见了树莓
I saw raspberry and rose petal doughnuts

321
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:36,620
加玫瑰花瓣甜甜圈
in the cafeteria today.

322
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,940
给你买了最后一份
Got you the last one.

323
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,200
你还记得
You remembered.

324
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,360
谢谢
Thank you.

325
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,060
霍华德·肖的化验结果
Howard Shaw's labs.

326
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,960
-我为你加急了化验  -你最好了
- I put a rush on them for you. - You're the best.

327
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:49,150
你为什么给格斯一个甜甜圈
Why did you give Gus a doughnut?

328
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,780
出于好意
I was being nice.

329
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:54,900
我急需病人的化验结果
I needed my patient's labs expedited.

330
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,260
-格斯喜欢甜甜圈  -你这是贿赂
- Gus likes doughnuts. - It's called bribery.

331
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:59,140
我这是「基本品格」
I call it "Basic human decency."

332
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:01,980
再见
See you later.

333
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:08,830
霍华德感染了超级病菌
Howard has a superbug.

334
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,610
艰难梭状芽胞杆菌感染
A C. Diff infection?

335
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,250
抗拒任何药物
It's resistant to all medication.

336
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,820
奎因的术前化验结果正常
Quinn's pre-op labs are normal,

337
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,680
明天一早我们就能做手术
so we can do the surgery first thing in the morning.

338
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:24,270
手术为腹股沟睾丸根治切除术
The procedure is called a radical inguinal orchiectomy.

339
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:29,100
能根治是因为生癌的睾丸会被整个移除
It's radical in that the entire cancerous testicle is removed.

340
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,230
功能性不会改变
All functionality will remain the same.

341
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:34,170
奎因一到两个礼拜后就能恢复正常活动
Quinn should be able to resume her normal activities in one or two weeks.

342
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:36,150
听见了吧宝贝  是好消息
See? Baby, that's good news.

343
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,200
并不是
No, not really.

344
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,400
失去了发育阻断剂
Without the puberty blockers,

345
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,780
我会成为芭蕾里一个有胡子的怪物
I'll be the freak in ballet with a mustache.

346
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,610
没有其他选择了吗
Aren't there any other options?

347
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:43,830
我希望有
I wish there were --

348
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:46,250
如果我们做双侧睾丸根治切除术
If we do a bilateral orchiectomy,

349
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,880
奎因会达到女性的睾酮水平
Quinn will have the testosterone level of a girl.

350
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,050
我们不会移除双侧睾丸
We are not removing both testicles.

351
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:53,460
你是要阉了我的孙子吗
You want to castrate my grandson?

352
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,420
不
No.

353
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,700
对于莫菲医生的言语我很抱歉
I'm so sorry - for Dr. Murphy's outburst.

354
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:00,570
反正我都会做性别确认手术
I'm gonna have gender confirmation surgery

355
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:01,870
等我十八岁
when I'm 18 anyway.

356
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:03,300
为什么不现在做
Why not just do it now.

357
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,220
奎因还是个孩子
Quinn is a child

358
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:11,800
还在玩换装和假扮游戏
who still plays dress-up and make-believe.

359
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:14,930
也许有天他会想要自己的孩子
He may want to have children of his own some day.

360
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,630
我们给你们点私人空间
We'll give you some privacy.

361
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:18,530
谢谢
Thank you.

362
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,760
我不允许你们
I will not allow you --

363
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,940
不是你来决定的
It's not up to you.

364
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,870
你现在让我很怀疑选你是否明智  莫菲
You are making me doubt the wisdom of drafting you, Murphy.

365
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:33,100
如果你随便对病人说煽动性的言语
If you go around saying inflammatory things to people,

366
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,490
只会让他们烦恼
it will only upset them.

367
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:37,490
我怎么知道自己说了煽动性语
How will I know if I said something inflammatory

368
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:38,720
如果我不说出口
until I say it?

369
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,180
先拿卡卢试试
Test it on Kalu first.

370
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:45,230
你们可以为这个病案准备共享决策援助的时候试试
Which you can do while the two of you prep an SDA for this case.

371
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:46,570
共享决策援助
An SDA?

372
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,780
共享决策援助
A Shared Decision Aid

373
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,930
就是将这个艰难决策的正反面
is a paper presenting the pros and cons

374
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,800
-呈现... -我知道那是什么  莫菲
- of making a difficult -- I know what it is, Murphy.

375
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,120
但是为什么我要被惩罚
But why am I being punished?

376
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,730
这不是惩罚  这是必要的步骤
It's not a punishment, it's necessary.

377
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:56,500
能帮助奎因的家人
It'll help Quinn's family

378
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,270
明白在奎因的问题上他们所有可能的选择
understand all the options available to them for her care.

379
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:00,560
明白了吗
Understood?

380
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,350
明白了
Understood.

381
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:07,610
粪便培养和灵敏试验
The stool culture and sensitivity test

382
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:10,040
都表明你对所有抗生素都有耐药性
indicate that you're resistant to every antibiotic.

383
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,740
这只可能发生在你使用过
Which only happens when you've been exposed

384
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,700
所有抗生素的情况下
to every antibiotic.

385
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,450
我  是我自己造成的
I -- I did this to myself?

386
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,770
但是我以前服用这些药并没有问题
But I've used those medications before without a problem.

387
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,240
现在怎么出问题了
Why did this happen now?

388
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:24,800
你没有看医生
You weren't under a doctor's care,

389
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,920
所以你很有可能因为错误的症状
so you were likely taking the wrong medication

390
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:28,180
服用了错误的药物
for the wrong symptoms.

391
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,550
但是你们可以治好的  对吗
But you can fix this, right?

392
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:32,070
我们得做一个结肠造口术
We're gonna have to perform a colostomy

393
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:34,980
将造瘘袋系统连接到你的腹部
where we attach an ostomy pouching system to your abdomen

394
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,510
来收集你体内的排泄物
to collect waste from your body.

395
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:38,370
多久
For how long?

396
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,610
根据我们看到的
Well, with the level of damage

397
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:41,910
整个结肠的损伤情况  是无限期的
we're seeing throughout the colon, indefinitely.

398
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:46,050
我们很遗憾  霍华德
I'm so sorry, Howard.

399
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,650
我不明白
I don't understand

400
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:57,510
你为什么要建议做双侧睾丸切除术
why you'd suggest the bilateral orchiectomy

401
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:59,080
而你甚至都不相信奎因是个女孩
when you don't even believe Quinn's a girl.

402
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,580
我是在回答利姆医生的问题
I was answering Dr. Lim's question.

403
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,890
她说没有别的选择
She said there were no other options,

404
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,210
但是我找到了一个
but I found one.

405
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:07,300
现在我们在这
And now we're here.

406
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,210
是的
Yes.

407
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:11,540
你还挺享受干杂活的  是吗
You're actually enjoying this scut work, aren't you?

408
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,550
是的  我们有帮上忙
Yes. We are being helpful.

409
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:17,690
我们做这个不是在帮忙  莫菲
We're not doing this to be helpful, Murphy.

410
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:19,610
我们做这个是因为你惹利姆生气了
We're doing this because you pissed off Lim,

411
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:21,060
而我是附带伤害
and I'm collateral damage.

412
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:24,760
我们还是有帮上忙
We're still being helpful.

413
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,680
无所谓
Doesn't matter.

414
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,070
无所谓了  比赛结束了
Doesn't matter, competition's over.

415
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,540
是吗
Is it?

416
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:35,900
我们在这里而不是和病人在一起
We're in here and not with the patient.

417
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,920
没有交流的时间  你还称呼她为「他」
No face time plus you calling her a "He"

418
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,650
也就等同于调查得分很糟糕
equals crappy survey scores.

419
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:41,510
没关系的  只是场游戏
It's okay. It's a game.

420
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:43,670
-不重要的  -对我来说很重要
- It's not important. - It is to me.

421
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:49,020
我是个弃民
I'm a pariah.

422
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,290
这些得分是我们住院医评测的一部分
These scores are part of our resident evaluation.

423
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:53,600
我们的工作就指望着这些得分了
Our jobs depend on them.

424
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,070
至少我的是
Mine does, at least.

425
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,560
那我们应该把这杂活做得特别好
Then we should do this scut work very well.

426
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,320
菲诺拉打过电话了
Finola called.

427
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,030
她发现咱俩的测试中有一个人的有异常
She found an irregularity with one of the tests

428
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,760
但想再测一次确定一下
but wants to re-run it to be sure.

429
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:26,130
好  那我们就等她重测
Okay, so we wait until she re-runs it.

430
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:28,580
马库斯  我们都是医生
Marcus, we're both doctors.

431
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,270
结果不会变的
The results aren't gonna change.

432
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,200
我等了太久了
I waited too long.

433
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,410
都是我的错
It's all my fault.

434
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,060
现在应该是你说
This is the part where you say,

435
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,390
「不  宝贝  不是你的错」的时候了
"No, babe, it isn't."

436
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,700
你有你的目标  其他要优先的东西
You had goals, other priorities.

437
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,890
你说你支持我的职业选择的
You said you supported my career choices,

438
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:54,000
就像我支持你的一样
just like I supported yours.

439
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,060
我支持你  永远都支持
I do support you. Always.

440
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:58,230
我很为你骄傲
And I am so proud of you.

441
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:00,240
但这是我们都知道
But it came at a cost

442
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,970
可能会产生的代价
that we both knew was possible.

443
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:05,080
-我们应该早点尝试的  -什么时候
- We should have started trying sooner. - When?

444
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:07,420
当你在三千英里远的达特茅斯教书的时候
When you were 3,000 miles away teaching at Dartmouth?

445
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,730
还是什么  你在争取当上外科主任的时候
Or, what, when you were chasing down head of surgery?

446
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,780
-我们本可以搞定的  -「搞定」
- We would have figured it out. - "Figuring it out"

447
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,700
意味着我和保姆一起养孩子
would have meant me and a nanny raising a baby.

448
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,200
我不想那样
I didn't want that.

449
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,720
我四年前就想说了
I tried to bring it up four years ago,

450
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,140
但你想要提升自己
but you wanted to get your practice up and running.

451
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:19,020
孩子也不在当时的计划内
A baby didn't fit in that picture, either.

452
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,470
那不一样
It is not the same.

453
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:22,960
有多少怀孕的女人会被雇佣
How many pregnant women get hired for anything?

454
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:24,580
又或者当他们发现一个女人家里有个孩子
Or when they find out a woman's got a child at home,

455
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,870
突然间就都是「谁来照顾孩子」
suddenly it's all "Who's gonna take care of the baby?"

456
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:28,770
没人会问男人这个问题
No one asks men that question.

457
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:30,570
是啊  现在都不重要了
Yeah, well, none of it matters now.

458
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,080
好吗  因为可能已经太晚了
Right? Because it's probably too late.

459
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:33,960
我早就知道
And I knew it.

460
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,790
我知道会发生这样的情况
I knew this was gonna happen.

461
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,340
你一直在想这件事
You've been stewing over this.

462
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:42,340
恨着我  多久了
Resenting me. For how long?

463
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,510
我不恨你  宝贝
I don't resent you, Is.

464
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:47,550
但是如果你想让我坐下来
But, you know, if you want me to sit here

465
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,200
告诉你那不是你的错
and tell you that it's not your fault,

466
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,060
我  我做不到  对不起
I -- I can't do that, I'm sorry.

467
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,170
你喜欢吗
You like?

468
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:15,730
门是锁着的
That door was locked.

469
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:16,570
我知道
Oh, I know.

470
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:18,820
装有线的家伙那里有个人取消了预定
The cable guy had a cancellation,

471
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:21,040
所以他给我连接了线路  买一赠一
so he hooked me up, got us a two-for-one.

472
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,500
作为之前的感谢
Little thanks for being so chill earlier.

473
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,810
谢谢  朋友
Gracias, amigo.

474
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,160
你是个什么医生
So, what kind of doctor are you?

475
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,110
外科医生
I'm a surgeon.

476
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,240
外科医生
A surgeon?

477
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:41,560
你的这些东西可看不出来你是个外科医生  是吗
Your stuff doesn't say surgeon, does it?

478
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,060
就像赛琳娜和贾斯汀
It's like, uh, Selena and Justin.

479
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:48,150
不是真的在一起
It doesn't really go together.

480
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,590
家俱像是从很多不同的地方弄来的
Furniture's from, like, a dozen different places.

481
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:51,700
14
Fourteen.

482
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:53,800
14
Fourteen.

483
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:57,130
卡斯珀的人知道我没钱
The people in Casper knew I didn't have any money,

484
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,400
所以他们给了我些东西来把家修整好
so they gave me things to make a home.

485
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:02,190
书架是珍妮弗给的
The bookshelf is from Jennifer,

486
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:03,890
她是市图书馆管理员
the town librarian.

487
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,870
我的桌子和椅子格雷迪先生的餐厅的
My table and chairs are from Mr. Grady's diner.

488
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,350
灯是雪儿的
The lamp is from Sheryl

489
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:11,700
她在高地教堂的主日学校教书
who teaches Sunday school at Highland Church.

490
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,770
格拉斯曼医生给我的床
Dr. Glassman, he got me my bed.

491
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:16,710
你不用把整个赠送表都告诉我  但...
Well, you don't have to tell me the whole list, but...

492
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:20,290
好吧  是的
Okay. Yes.

493
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,790
我拥有的一切都能用
Everything I have works.

494
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:23,870
没必要换了
There is no need to change it.

495
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:24,880
厉害
Respect.

496
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:47,330
我是格拉斯曼医生
I'm Dr. Glassman.

497
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:48,970
我是医院的院长
I'm the president of the hospital.

498
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:50,190
一切都还好吗
Is everything okay?

499
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,140
坐
Sit down.

500
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,490
奎因的状况没什么改变
There has been no change in Quinn's condition.

501
00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:01,020
然而  她外婆指控
However, her grandmother has made a claim of child abuse

502
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:03,490
你和你丈夫虐待儿童
against you and your husband.

503
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:08,400
她说让奎因服用青春期阻滞剂...
She's claiming that putting Quinn on puberty blockers --

504
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,250
这是她的原话
and these are her words,

505
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:14,050
「让她觉得做个跨性别者也可以」
"Making her think that being trans is okay" --

506
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:17,900
是对情感和身体的虐待
is a form of emotional and physical abuse.

507
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,130
说明一下
Now, just to be clear,

508
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:23,960
我们不认为这些指控
we don't believe any of these allegations

509
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,230
有什么价值
have any merit whatsoever.

510
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:26,640
我了解我妈  好吗
I know my mom, okay?

511
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,270
她不会放弃的
She's not gonna drop this.

512
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:29,570
她会去法院
She'll go to court.

513
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:31,130
她会得到抚养权吗
Could she get custody?

514
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:34,870
她可以试试  但是利姆医生会作证的
Well, she could try, but, uh, Dr. Lim would testify.

515
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:38,310
他们会把她放到寄养家庭的
They could put her in a foster home.

516
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,190
泰  她撑不过去的
Ty, she won't make it.

517
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:43,200
如果我们现在就让奎因做她想做的手术
If we let Quinn do the surgery she wants now,

518
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,430
就都结束了
it'll all be over.

519
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,190
鲁思就没理由告我们了
There will be no reason for Ruth to fight us.

520
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,740
做奎因想要的
Do what Quinn wants.

521
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:56,880
做那个双侧睾丸切除术
Do the bilateral surgery.

522
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,580
有个问题
There is an issue.

523
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,820
你的检验结果证实了你的精液参数异常
Your tests confirmed abnormalities in the semen parameters.

524
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:17,410
你说什么
I beg your pardon?

525
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,350
精液分析
The semen analysis.

526
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:21,740
结果显示你的精子数量和活力都很低
It showed that you have a low sperm count and low motility.

527
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,680
是我的错
It's my fault?

528
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,200
不
No.

529
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,060
我们  我们不用「错」这样的字眼
We -- we do not speak in terms of fault.

530
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,620
百分之十五的夫妇深受不孕烦恼
15% of all couples struggle with infertility,

531
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:34,940
在那之中  有一半是男方的原因
and of those, 50% have a male factor component.

532
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:38,750
不是好消息  但也不是没希望了
It's not great news, but it's not a dead end.

533
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,960
那下一步怎么办
So what's the next step?

534
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:43,200
我会为你们引见阿琼·迪隆医生
I'm gonna refer you to Dr. Arjun Dhillon.

535
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,430
他是杰出的泌尿专家
He's an excellent urologist,

536
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,720
他会给马库斯做个全面的检查
and he'll give Marcus a -- a full physical,

537
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,520
做血检  超声
do some blood work, and an ultrasound.

538
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,380
不可能啊
That can't be right.

539
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,340
-马库斯  -不可能啊
- Marcus. - It can't be right.

540
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:53,190
马库斯  我们可以解决的
Marcus. We got this.

541
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,420
好吗
Okay?

542
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:56,060
我们会一起挺过去的
We're gonna get through this together.

543
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,240
为什么不告诉我霍华德的化验结果出来了
Why didn't you tell me Howard's labs came back?

544
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,070
当你把坏消息告诉他的时候我本该在场的
I should have been there when you broke the bad news to him.

545
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:11,660
这样梅伦德斯就能看到你同情病人的样子
So Melendez could see your touching bedside manner.

546
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,490
不管怎样无所谓了
It doesn't matter anyway.

547
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:15,960
无所谓  怎么会无所谓
Oh, it doesn't? How the hell not?

548
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,450
那个可怜的家伙要做结肠造口术
The poor guy's getting a colostomy.

549
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:20,760
我们不可能赢这场比赛的
There's no way we're winning this competition.

550
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,500
你真的一点都不同情
You really have no sympathy

551
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,820
霍华德的遭遇吗
for what Howard's going through?

552
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,610
的确很惨
It's a major bummer, no doubt.

553
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:28,490
但是我们没时间对每个治疗的病患
But we don't have time to get emotionally invested

554
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:30,200
都投入那么多感情
in every patient that we treat.

555
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:32,470
我们的工作就是  进手术室  做手术
Our job is to go in, do the surgery,

556
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:33,510
然后出来
and get out.

557
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:36,780
在那之后  他的粪便或是其他什么人的粪便
Afterwards -- his poop, someone else's poop --

558
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:38,500
都不关我们的事
it's not our problem.

559
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:40,830
等等
Hey, well, wait.

560
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:44,610
如果我们给霍华德做一个粪便菌群移植呢
What if we could get Howard a fecal microbiota transplant?

561
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:47,870
将粪便菌群移植应用于外科病例
FMT for a surgical case?

562
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:50,270
理论上  我们把健康人的粪便移植给他
Theoretically, we transfer healthy feces to him,

563
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:51,790
这样可以让重建他机体的微生物群落
it restores good flora to the body,

564
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,030
清除艰难梭菌感染
kills off the CDI,

565
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:55,020
这样他就不用做任何手术了
and he avoids surgery all together.

566
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,340
这主意听上去可行
We could actually win this thing.

567
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:02,280
在请示梅伦德斯前我要把相关文献全都查一遍
I'm gonna pull all the research before pitching it to Melendez.

568
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,040
这次的会议名叫
So, this meeting is called

569
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:10,120
疑难患者会诊
a Challenging Patient Consultation Process.

570
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:10,920
这名字真烂
The name sucks,

571
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,760
但是这次会议的某些部分我还是挺喜欢的
but there are things about it I do like.

572
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:17,920
你们要做的就是交流  倾听
All you got to do is talk and listen

573
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:20,000
并且试着相互理解
and try to understand each other.

574
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,270
有什么好理解的
What's to understand?

575
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:23,240
鲁思指控我们虐待儿童
Ruth accused us of being child abusers.

576
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,610
有什么可讨论的
And what's to discuss?

577
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:25,920
我们是奎因的父母
We are Quinn's parents.

578
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,750
我们可以替她做医疗决定
We get to make her medical decisions.

579
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:29,470
如果奎妮更适合做男生呢
What if Quinnie's better off as a boy?

580
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:32,940
你根本就不知道奎因经历过什么
You have no idea - what Quinn has been through.

581
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,560
每个孩子都会经历困难
Every kid - goes through rough patches.

582
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,350
每个孩子都会感到迷茫
Every kid is confused.

583
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:40,500
奎因从三岁起  她就能清楚地告诉我们她是谁
Quinn has always told us exactly who she was, ever since she was 3.

584
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,150
所以你就让奎因玩洋娃娃
So you let Quinn play with dolls.

585
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:43,260
真了不起啊
Big deal.

586
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:45,260
你不愿做出改变人生的重大决定
You don't make life-altering decisions

587
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:47,990
就因为孩子想做小公主
because a child wants to be a princess.

588
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,640
我们让奎因在家随心所欲
We used to let Quinn do whatever she wanted at home.

589
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:57,730
但是当她在外面的时候
But when she went out in public,

590
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:00,600
我们让她表现出男孩子的行为举止
we made her present as a boy.

591
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,650
这样对她不公平
It felt false to her.

592
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:05,430
她不喜欢这样
She hated it.

593
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:07,240
她讨厌她自己
She hated herself.

594
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:10,580
她开始变得孤僻  抑郁
She became reclusive, depressed.

595
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:13,740
一年前  奎因甚至试图自杀
And then a year ago, Quinn tried to kill herself.

596
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,290
抱歉  我来晚了
Sorry I'm late.

597
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:34,210
如果我们为霍华德进行粪便菌群移植
Howard might not need the colostomy

598
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:37,200
或许他就不用做结肠造口术了
if we give him - a fecal microbiota transplant.

599
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:41,060
粪便菌群移植不是已经反复讨论过很多遍了吗
Hasn't the FDA gone back and forth on that?

600
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,490
我们可能会在他的体内引入新的细菌
We could be introducing new bacteria into his system

601
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:44,200
他可能因此死亡
that could kill him.

602
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,670
出现这种情况的可能性很低
The likelihood of that is low.

603
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:46,430
但不是没有
But not zero.

604
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:48,110
可如果我们给他做了结肠造口术
But if we do the colostomy,

605
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,530
这根本不是在帮他
we may not really be helping him.

606
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:52,560
15%到30%的病患在第一次艰难梭菌感染后
15% to 30% of patients get recurrent CDI

607
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,560
会出现反复艰难梭菌感染
after the initial bout.

608
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,770
这个观点很好
That's a good point.

609
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:56,380
我想其中有65%的
I believe 65% of that time,

610
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,990
反复艰难梭菌感染会发展为慢性感染
recurrent CDI becomes chronic,

611
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:00,490
并导致反复住院治疗甚至死亡
which can lead to repeated hospitalizations and death.

612
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,820
我说的数据对吗  克莱尔
Are my numbers right, Claire?

613
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:05,910
对
Yes.

614
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:08,320
而最新的研究表明
But recent studies

615
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:12,430
粪便菌群移植的成功率高达95%
show better than - a 95% success rate with FMTs.

616
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,270
霍华德是一个合适的人选
Howard is a good candidate.

617
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:16,850
我们应该在他发展为中毒性巨结肠前尽力一试
We should try it before he develops a toxic megacolon.

618
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:19,050
这不是我们亏欠他和他双胞胎的吗
Don't we owe it to him, to his twins,

619
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:21,170
至少在做侵入性手术前
to at least try an experimental treatment

620
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:22,770
尝试一下试验性治疗
before doing an invasive surgery

621
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:24,420
或许这可以改变他的一生
which will alter his life forever?

622
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,040
你们说得对
You're right.

623
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:27,510
为他做准备吧
Prep him for the procedure.

624
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,800
我很欣赏你们为病患着想的精神
I appreciate your passionate advocacy for your patient.

625
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,190
你们俩  干得好
Good work, both of you.

626
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:37,410
现在你倒是会团队合作了
Now you're a team player.

627
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:38,860
当然  这对我有利
When it benefits me, yes.

628
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:41,650
说到这  在你做研究的时候
Speaking of which, while you were doing your research,

629
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:43,260
我在粪便库里找到了和霍华德匹配的粪便
I found Howard a match at the stool bank.

630
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,910
样本几个小时后送到
Sample arrives in a couple of hours.

631
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:45,410
很好
Great.

632
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:47,320
等样品送到的时候
I let them know you'd be the designated doctor

633
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,780
我会告诉他们
to handle the medical chain of custody

634
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,210
你是处理医疗监护链的指定医生
when the sample arrives.

635
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:51,710
所以呢...
So...?

636
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:54,550
所以你是唯一能处理样品的人
So you're the only person who can handle the sample.

637
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:57,180
你得自己进行稀释  混合  过滤
You'll have to dilute it, blend it, strain it all on your own.

638
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,640
当然  这是为了防止交叉污染
To safeguard against cross-contamination, of course.

639
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:01,260
当然
Of course.

640
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:12,980
你的体温和血压正常
Your temperature and BP are normal.

641
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,780
正常  这意味着什么
Normal. Whatever that means.

642
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:17,820
典型  平常
Typical. Usual.

643
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,770
符合预期
Expected.

644
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,220
是吗  可是我觉得我跟这些词一点也沾不上边
Yeah, I don't feel like any of those things.

645
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,560
做女生是一种什么感觉
What does it feel like to be a girl?

646
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:31,520
你生气了
Are you angry?

647
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,520
这是个恼人的问题吗
Was that an inflammatory question?

648
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,780
比起被人们盯着指指点点
I'd rather people ask questions

649
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,620
我宁愿人们问问题
instead of pointing and staring.

650
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,300
以前我看上去是男孩的时候
When I used to look like a boy,

651
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:43,100
我感到...一切都变了
I felt...different.

652
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,180
学校的孩子们不理解我
The kids at school didn't understand me,

653
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,510
所以他们对我指指点点
so they picked on me.

654
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:49,630
大部分时间我都自己一个人
I spent a lot of time alone.

655
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:54,020
当我父母让我做自己的时候
When my parents let me be me,

656
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:55,790
我感觉...
I felt...

657
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:58,700
感觉我再也不用去假扮别人
like I didn't - have to pretend anymore.

658
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:03,110
我感到自由  就像你在一个游泳池里
I felt free, like when you're in a pool

659
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:04,890
你可以尽情自由地漂浮
and you just let go and float.

660
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:11,530
我不太会游泳
I'm not a very good swimmer.

661
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,770
我不知道假扮别人
I don't know what it feels like

662
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:26,020
是什么感觉
to be anyone but me.

663
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:29,780
我也是
Me, too.

664
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:36,900
双侧手术比单侧手术风险更大吗
Is the bilateral more risky than the unilateral surgery?

665
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,650
双侧手术最大的问题就是
The big issue with the bilateral

666
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:41,350
奎因以后再也不能生育了
is Quinn will never be able to have biological children.

667
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:43,620
如果奎因的父母觉得奎因的思想
If Quinn's parents think that Quinn's mature enough

668
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:44,960
已经足够成熟坚强
and strong enough in her beliefs,

669
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:46,050
那手术应该尽快进行
then they should do it now.

670
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:49,080
这是一个孩子的择期手术
It's an elective surgery on a child.

671
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,700
没有医学上的必要性
There is no medical necessity.

672
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,750
除了  之前的自杀意图
Except with - a previous suicide attempt,

673
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:53,730
她仍处在危险中
she's still at risk.

674
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:55,290
现在她的情况已经不同了
Her situation is different now.

675
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:58,210
在社会角度她已经完成过渡  作为女孩生活了
She's socially transitioned and living as a girl.

676
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:00,440
但现在仍然没有足够的
But there just isn't enough good data

677
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,730
跨性别儿童及其预后相关数据
on trans kids and their outcomes.

678
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:04,490
另一方面  我们有很好的理由相信
On the other hand, there's very good reason

679
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:06,180
保留未来的生育能力是有可能的
to preserve future fertility.

680
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,700
利姆医生和安德鲁斯医生
Dr. Lim and Dr. Andrews

681
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,530
都是非常优秀的外科医生
are both very excellent surgeons,

682
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:12,120
他们都有自己明确的观点
and they very clearly have some passionate points of view,

683
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,390
但那是他们的观点
but their views are their own.

684
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:17,030
你们需要决定怎么做对奎因最好
You all need to decide what's best for Quinn.

685
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,790
无论我们如何决定
Whatever we decide,

686
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:22,720
奎因都将是个女孩
Quinn is still gonna be a girl.

687
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,150
我不知道我能不能接受这一点
I don't know if I'll ever be able to accept that.

688
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,530
我知道我说这话听起来很可怕
I know that makes me sound horrible.

689
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:35,560
我知道不把家庭放在第一位是什么感觉
I know what it's like to not put your family first,

690
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:37,890
那让我付出了代价
and it cost me.

691
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:40,830
付出了十分惨痛的代价
It cost me a great deal.

692
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:44,480
如果一切重新来过
And if I had to do it all over again,

693
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,610
我会扪心自问
I'd ask myself --

694
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:48,250
为我爱的人而牺牲性命
is it really worth sacrificing a life

695
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:54,610
是否胜过为某个荒诞不经的理想而奋斗一生
with someone I love over an idea that may never be?

696
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,530
我们给他们些空间吧
Why don't we give them the room?

697
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,960
叫我来有什么事
I got the page. What's going on.

698
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,040
她刚刚疼得直叫唤  还有呕吐
She started screaming in pain and vomiting.

699
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:14,930
体温40℃
Temp's 104.

700
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:17,990
持续进展腹股沟区疼痛  可能是附睾炎
Increased groin pain could be attributed to epididymitis,

701
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:19,650
肾结石  腹股沟疝...
kidney stones, inguinal hernia...

702
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:20,670
肿瘤的自重
The extra weight of the tumor

703
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:22,740
可能引起睾丸发生自身扭转
could be causing the testicle to twist on itself.

704
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,280
睾丸没有血流通过
There'd be no blood flow.

705
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:33,030
她发生了睾丸扭转
She has a testicular torsion.

706
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,130
需要立即手术
She needs surgery now.

707
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,560
抱歉  你们做好决定了吗
Excuse me. Have you made a decision?

708
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,440
还没有  我是说  有很多东西需要
Not yet. - I mean, there's a lot to --

709
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,790
我们现在就要答案
We need one now.

710
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:49,710
奎因发生了睾丸扭转
Quinn has testicular torsion.

711
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,460
精索扭曲
The spermatic cord is twisted

712
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,670
切断了血流供应
and cutting off blood supply.

713
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:53,640
我们需要进行手术
We need to operate.

714
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,180
如果你希望奎因按照她的意愿生活
If you want Quinn to live the way she wants,

715
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:02,610
那么现在  不要限制她的未来
don't limit her future now.

716
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,340
你听到我妈妈说的了
You heard her when my mom said

717
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,920
她某天可能会想要孩子
she might want kids some day.

718
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:09,600
她还只是个孩子
She can't even fathom the thought

719
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,230
她不知道自己在想什么
because she's just a child.

720
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:19,980
就做医学上必须的治疗吧
Just do what's medically necessary.

721
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:31,450
似乎没有明显的淋巴结肿大
Doesn't appear to be any palpable lymphadenopathy.

722
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:34,310
很可能是间质瘤
It's likely a stromal tumor,

723
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:36,060
但还是送病理学检测
but get that to pathology right away.

724
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:36,880
好的
Yes, sir.

725
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:44,430
奎因有心动过速和低血压
Quinn has tachycardia and hypotension.

726
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,590
我没看到任何出血
I'm not seeing any bleeding.

727
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,410
心电图正常  不是冠状动脉的问题
EKG's normal. It's not coronary.

728
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,690
二氧化碳和氧含量正常  不是心包积液
CO2 and O2 are normal, so it's not a P.E.

729
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:52,350
那一定是对麻醉剂的不良反应
It must be a reaction to the anesthesia.

730
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:54,920
已经推注了液体和血管收缩剂
I'm already pushing fluids and vasoconstrictors.

731
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:05,640
已经推注了六管注射器  没有泄露迹象
Six syringes in, and no sign of leakage.

732
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,050
好了  我们这里搞定了
Okay, we're wrapped up here.

733
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:09,060
我们来让霍华德恢复吧
Let's get Howard into recovery.

734
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,640
-干得好  -谢谢
- Well done. - Thanks.

735
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:13,550
我在考虑把手术过程写出来
I was thinking of writing up the procedure,

736
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:15,430
也许可以提交出版
possibly submit it for publication.

737
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,340
我很愿意来帮忙
I'd be happy to assist,

738
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,100
看在我之前做过的份上
seeing as I've done it before.

739
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:20,980
谢谢  但我觉得我可以...
Thanks, but I think I can --

740
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:23,270
我看过你在《美国外科学》的论文  雷兹尼克医生
I read your paper in AMSURG, Dr. Reznick.

741
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:24,750
令人印象深刻
You continue to impress.

742
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:27,630
从你嘴里说出来这话  我真是受宠若惊
Coming from you, I take that as a huge compliment.

743
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:30,630
你有机会的话  布朗医生
When you get a chance, Dr. Browne,

744
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:32,090
真应该读一读
you should read it.

745
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,290
我会的
Will do.

746
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,040
我给了升压药
I've given vasopressors

747
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,140
并尽可能地减少了药物
and reduced her meds as much as I can.

748
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:46,440
她某处在失血
She's losing volume somewhere.

749
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,920
结扎精索时还未有此事
It was dry when we ligated the spermatic cord.

750
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:49,800
我还没找到出血点
I'm still not seeing the bleed.

751
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,990
可能是断裂神经的迷走神经性刺激
Could be vagal stimulation from the severed nerve.

752
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:54,210
但她对肾上腺素无反应
But she's not responding to epi.

753
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:56,600
-败血症吗  -还太早  不会发生感染
- Sepsis? - It's too early for an infection.

754
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,650
她的平均动脉压为20  几乎不够了
Her MAP is 20. She's barely profusing.

755
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,970
好吧  打断一下
Okay, excuse me, guys.

756
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,810
-你把手术服弄坏了  -抱歉
- You're breaking scrub. - I'm so sorry.

757
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:08,880
体征左腰部青紫斑
Grey-Turner sign.

758
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:11,240
可能是腹膜后出血
Could be a retroperitoneal hemorrhage.

759
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:24,880
也许杰瑞德说得对
Jared could be right.

760
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:28,380
有可能是内出血
It is possible that there's internal bleeding.

761
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:32,190
睾丸动脉可能会缩回骨盆
The testicular artery can retract up into the pelvis.

762
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:34,260
虽然很少见  但有这个可能
It's rare, but it can happen.

763
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,730
确实非常罕见  安德鲁斯医生
Rare is an understatement. Dr. Andrews?

764
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:40,950
我觉得我们别无选择
I don't think we have any other choice.

765
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:42,730
我们得做剖腹探查  十号刀
We need to do an ex-lap. 10 blade.

766
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,870
莫菲  拉紧
Murphy, retract.

767
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:03,440
内出血
Internal bleeding.

768
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,920
杰瑞德是对的
Jared was right.

769
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,200
干得漂亮  卡卢医生
Nice call, Dr. Kalu.

770
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,120
谢谢你  先生
Thank you, sir.

771
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:11,050
卡卢  抽吸
Kalu, suction.

772
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:12,560
我们需要清晰视野
We need a clear view of the field.

773
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:18,850
圣何塞圣文德医院

774
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:23,120
烧退了  你体内的菌群也恢复正常了
Fever's down, and the flora in your system seems to be returning to normal.

775
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:26,970
-我们期待你的全面恢复  -谢谢你们做的一切
- We expect a full recovery. - Thank you. For everything.

776
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,080
请问我什么时候可以有访客
Do you know when I can have visitors?

777
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:30,940
我想着你也该问了
I thought you might ask that question.

778
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:34,140
有几个小朋友很想和你打招呼
There are a couple of eager preschoolers who'd like to say hi.

779
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:37,920
-爸爸  -凯拉  萨米
- Daddy! - Keira! Sammy!

780
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,280
你们好像长大了
I think you guys have grown!

781
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,890
是这几位医生救了爸爸
These are the doctors that saved Daddy.

782
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,400
雷兹尼克医生和这位...
Dr. Reznick and this is, uh...

783
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:51,330
抱歉  我忘了你叫什么了
I'm sorry, I forgot your name.

784
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,150
布朗医生
Dr. Browne.

785
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:55,370
-谢谢  -谢谢
- Thank you. - Thank you.

786
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,090
不客气
You're welcome.

787
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,320
好了
Okay.

788
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,540
这是谁
Who's this guy?

789
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:07,100
-熊熊  -熊熊
- Bear Bear. - Bear Bear?

790
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,120
你做了吗
Did you do it?

791
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,750
把两个都移走了吗
Did you remove both?

792
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:20,770
没有
No.

793
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:22,350
只移走了癌变的那个
Just the cancerous one.

794
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,210
什么  为什么
What? Why not?

795
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:26,440
我决定的
That's on me.

796
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:29,130
凭良心讲  我没法切掉健康的器官
I couldn't, in good conscience, remove a healthy organ.

797
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,250
奎妮
Quinnie.

798
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:36,930
这是我们的决定
This was our decision.

799
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:38,910
不  你说了你会站在我这边
No! You said you were on my side!

800
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:41,580
我们当然站在你这边
Hey, we are. Always.

801
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:43,630
我们还没来得及好好聊聊
We haven't had enough time to talk,

802
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:46,360
我们互相之间  以及和你的心理医生
not with each other, with your therapist,

803
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,600
和你的医生
with your doctors.

804
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,500
这么说我要变成男孩了
So I'm gonna turn into a boy.

805
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,140
不会那么快
Well, not right away.

806
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:52,970
你的内分泌医师
Your endocrinologist will talk to you

807
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:56,010
会和你聊开始使用女性激素的时间线
about the right timeline for starting feminizing hormones.

808
00:36:58,970 --> 00:36:59,800
你知道...
You know...

809
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,080
想到你以后会有自己的孩子
the thought of having your own kids someday

810
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,380
是个重大决定
is a big decision,

811
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,810
但你长大后就搞不清楚自己到底是否想要孩子
but you never know what you will or will not want once you get older.

812
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:12,410
人们总是很看重自己生孩子这事
Cis people are always so worked up about having bio kids.

813
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:13,780
但如果我真的很想要孩子
If I really want a kid that bad,

814
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:15,700
我可以领养
I can just adopt.

815
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,240
我十八岁时会回来
You know, I'll be back when I'm 18

816
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,360
做我的性别确认手术
for my gender confirmation surgery.

817
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:26,250
你回来时  我会在这儿帮你
And when you do, I'll be here to help you.

818
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:35,880
病人的满意度调查来了
Patient satisfaction survey scores are in,

819
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,640
非常接近
and it was very close.

820
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,430
其实算不上  她太友善了
Not really. She's being kind.

821
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:43,270
恭喜雷兹尼克医生和布朗医生
Congratulations go to Dr. Reznick and Dr. Browne.

822
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:45,120
-太棒了  -谢谢
- Yes. - Thank you.

823
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:48,160
恭喜
Congratulations.

824
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,230
谢谢你  肖恩
Thank you, Shaun.

825
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:51,010
我跟克莱尔合作得很好
Claire and I make a nice team.

826
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,990
你应该很激动
You should be psyched.

827
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,200
是啊  我应该
Yeah. I should be.

828
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:03,380
战利品属于胜利者
To the victor belong the spoils.

829
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:04,770
全部付清
Pay up.

830
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,740
你总是做不到谦逊
Humility was never your strong suit.

简直无法想象

我想象不到那会是何感受

外表的不同
