3
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:12,780
我还想和你做朋友
I want to be your friend again.

4
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:15,980
为什么  肖恩  怎么了
W-why, Shaun? What happened?

5
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:18,270
人们需要朋友
People need friends.

6
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:19,220
这...
Well...

7
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:21,660
确实如此
Yeah, they do.

8
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:24,580
但你说你希望我
But you said you wanted me -

9
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,730
别再打扰你  记得吗
to stop interfering, remember?

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,620
你想要空间
You wanted space.

11
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,740
你想  自己犯错
You wanted - to make your own mistakes.

12
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:34,790
比起空间  我更需要朋友
I need a friend more than I need space.

13
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,750
你是位优秀的导师  很好的朋友
You were a good mentor and a good friend.

14
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,450
谢谢你  肖恩
Well, thank you, Shaun.

15
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:49,690
你无法想象这话对我有多重要
You don't know how much it means to me to hear you say that.

16
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,330
但我觉得
But I-I think...

17
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:58,280
我觉得你可能要找个新导师
I think you may need a new mentor.

18
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,160
我活不久了
I'm dying.

19
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:19,190
还剩十二到十八个月
12 to 18 months.

20
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,500
我希望你不要告诉其他人
I'd appreciate it - if you didn't tell anyone, okay?

21
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,830
就让我一人承受
I-I will in my own time.

22
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:26,000
好  你做过全面病情检查吗
Okay. Have you had a full work-up?

23
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:27,850
当然做了
Yes, of course.

24
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:30,220
有可能是从其他地方
It could be a secondary tumor

25
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:32,520
转移到你大脑的继发性肿瘤
metastasized to your brain from somewhere else.

26
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,880
只发现了这个肿瘤
It's the only tumor found.

27
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,870
可能是炎症或者感染症状
It could be an inflammatory or infectious process.

28
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,520
就是肿瘤  肖恩
It was a tumor, Shaun.

29
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,870
你该听听不同意见
You should get a second opinion.

30
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,970
肖恩  我当了三十年的神经外科医生
Shaun, I've been a neurosurgeon for 30 years.

31
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:45,250
我想这就是有力的「不同意见」
I think that qualifies as a second opinion.

32
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:48,870
你该问问其他人的意见
You should get a second opinion.

33
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,520
必须搞清楚是不是...
You have to know whether --

34
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,470
好好好  肖恩
All right, all right, all right, all right, Shaun.

35
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:52,860
我会去问问其他人的
I'll get a second opinion.

36
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,730
好吗
Okay?

37
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,170
好
Okay.

38
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:56,980
我能去工作了吗
Can I go to work now?

39
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,670
好  医生  诊断结果如何
Okay, Doctor, what's your diagnosis?

40
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:04,880
我醉了
I'm drunk.

41
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,950
不是你  是另一位医生
Not you. Other doctor.

42
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:11,000
鉴于扭曲的程度
Uh, well, given the degree of the rotation

43
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,220
以及骨折情况近乎复合伤
and the fact that the break is almost compound,

44
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,870
我想目前的情况是双踝骨折
I'd say we're dealing with a Bimalleolar

45
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,050
或者是三踝骨折
or Trimalleolar fracture.

46
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:17,760
很好  还有呢
Very good. What else?

47
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:22,240
颜色
Color?

48
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,180
血流堵住了
Blood flow is restricted.

49
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:26,270
他的脚保不住了
His foot's dying.

50
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:27,960
别啊
Oh, no.

51
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,440
现在得给他复位  按住他的腿
I'm gonna have to reset it now. Hold his leg.

52
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:33,190
-不不不  -没事的
- No.No, no, no. - No, it's okay.

53
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,140
很快就好
It's just gonna take a second.

54
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,420
你数到三
I need you to count to three.

55
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:36,550
一
One...

56
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:38,830
一  二
One, two --

57
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,130
卡登的腿没事吧
Is Caden's leg gonna be okay?

58
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:48,080
他的腿这样有多久了
How long has his leg been like this

59
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,500
到底发生了什么
and how exactly did it happen?

60
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:52,060
我找到他时他就这样了
Well, he's been like that since I found him.

61
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,430
可能磕马路牙子上了
He probably tripped over a curb or something

62
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:56,490
我就是在路边找到他的
because that's where he was.

63
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,630
你为什么觉得有必要跟我讲两遍
Any reason you felt the need to tell me twice

64
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:59,770
你找到他时的情形吗
that you found him like this?

65
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,970
朴医生  他得做手术
Dr. Park, boy's going to surgery.

66
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:02,970
你要一起来
You're going with.

67
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:04,990
别走开了
Don't go anywhere.

68
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:18,580
不该给我打麻醉吗
Shouldn't I be asleep for this?

69
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:21,790
你血液中的酒精含量会影响麻醉药
Your blood alcohol level complicates anesthesia

70
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:23,580
而且你可能有脑震荡
and we think you have a concussion,

71
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,820
所以得让你保持清醒
so we're gonna keep you responsive.

72
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,430
不过有给你做局部神经麻醉
We did give you a regional nerve block,

73
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,270
所以你应该没感觉
so you shouldn't feel anything.

74
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:33,840
很好
Cool.

75
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:37,000
把液晶聚合板在近端倾斜两度
Bend the LCP plate over two degrees on the proximal end.

76
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,270
金冠成形钳
Contouring pliers.

77
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:45,910
血压下降  心跳加速
BP is dropping, heart rate's rising.

78
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:48,390
给他插管  立刻静脉注射肾上腺素
Let's tube him. IV fluids and phenylephrine, stat.

79
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,470
得停止手术处理其他情况
We need to abort until we can get a handle on what else is going on.

80
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:54,310
做全身CT扫描  查血常规  做超声心动图
Give me a full body CT, full blood panels, and an echo.

81
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,610
我和杰瑞德或许能更快找出问题
I think Jared and I may be able to dig up an answer quicker.

82
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:58,040
好  快去
Great. Get on it.

83
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,870
有想法了吗
Come up with anything?

84
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:05,860
我也没有
Neither did I.

85
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:11,140
我在旧金山市立医院有个神经外科医生朋友
I had a friend, a neurosurgeon, at SF Muni.

86
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,880
她看了扫描图
She looked at the scans.

87
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:15,710
得出相同的诊断  肖恩
She came to the same diagnosis, Shaun.

88
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:18,570
我有不能动手术的胶质瘤
I have an inoperable glioma.

89
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:19,880
明白吗
Okay?

90
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,340
你该回去工作了  好吗
I think you should go back to work, yes?

91
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,070
我得去工作
I need to go to work.

92
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:48,490
理智点
Be reasonable.

93
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:49,560
你说什么
Beg your pardon?

94
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,210
明智点
Be reasonable.

95
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,970
我不知道你在说什么
I have no idea what you're talking about.

96
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:54,200
你会明白的
Oh, it'll be clear.

97
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,580
卡登到底怎么了
What the hell happened to Caden?

98
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,050
我不知道  他扭到脚踝了  我
I -- I don't know. He twisted his ankle. I --

99
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,310
你之前在撒谎
You lied to me before.

100
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:00,650
现在还在撒谎  你个娇生惯养的孬种
You're lying to me now, you spoiled little coward.

101
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,580
理智点
Be reasonable.

102
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,200
他的朋友受伤了
His friend's hurt.

103
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,820
他很害怕  你把他吓坏了
He's scared, and you're freaking him out.

104
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,890
他生气了  但他说得没错
He's angry, but he's not wrong.

105
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,620
卡登情况很糟  我们不知道原因
Caden's in bad shape, and we don't know why.

106
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,950
我们得知道发生了什么
We need to know what happened.

107
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:28,640
不不  别担心他
No, no, don't -- don't worry about him.

108
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,690
跟我说
Talk to me.

109
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,000
说实话
You tell me the truth.

110
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:35,170
不会有麻烦的  你只是在帮你的朋友
You won't get in trouble. You'll just...help a friend.

111
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:37,600
好吧
All right.

112
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:40,720
我们当时在宣誓入会
We were pledging.

113
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:43,540
要想入会就得通过
And there's -- there's this, uh, wheel of torture thing

114
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,370
「折磨之轮」的考验
you got to do for initiation.

115
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,480
-折磨  -都是些脑残行为
- Torture? - But it's mos-- - it's mostly stupid stuff, dude.

116
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,870
比如  喝一杯橄榄油
It's, like, like, drink a cup of olive oil

117
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:53,430
或者吃一勺肉桂粉
or eat a tablespoon of cinnamon.

118
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:54,770
卡登转到了什么
And what did Caden land on?

119
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:55,740
洗衣服
Laundry.

120
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:57,250
他得洗衣服
He had to do laundry?

121
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,630
不不  他得吃洗衣服用的东西
No, like, like, he had to, uh, eat th-those laundry things,

122
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,310
三十秒内看能吃多少
as many as he could in 30 seconds.

123
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:06,330
洗涤剂  吃洗涤剂
Detergent? Eat detergent?

124
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,640
他吃了多少
And how many did he have?

125
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,790
不知道  可能吃了六七...
I don't know. Like six, maybe seven, seven.

126
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,860
他吃了洗涤剂
He ate detergent.

127
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,980
可能会烧穿他的食道
Could've burned a hole through his esophagus

128
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,120
或者他的胃和肠子
or his stomach and intestines.

129
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:23,620
请堵住那个出血点
Catch that bleeder, please.

130
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,250
希望他别生孩子
Let's hope he doesn't breed.

131
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,730
怎么  他难道不是个蠢蛋吗
What? He isn't an idiot?

132
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,910
消化道都修补好了
We have healthy bowel attached to healthy bowel.

133
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:32,720
我们开始缝合吧
Let's close him up.

134
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,830
梅伦德斯医生
Dr. Melendez?

135
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:36,290
创伤科呼叫你去第二手术室
The trauma S.O.D. is asking for you in O.R. Number 2.

136
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,020
有一台紧急开胸手术
We got an emergency thoracotomy.

137
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:39,850
谁能告诉我余下的缝合步骤
Who can give me - the remaining steps for closing?

138
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,230
剪断锚定缝线  清理周边区域
Cut anchoring sutures, clear laps,

139
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:42,180
将消化道归位
and reposition the bowel.

140
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,950
从十二指肠切除处移除夹钳
Remove clamps from the duodenal resection site,

141
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,550
不要遮挡下方动脉
keeping clear of the underlying aorta,

142
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,560
缝合筋膜  用环端0号单丝线
close the fascia using a looped 0 monofilament,

143
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,790
缝合真皮层以及表皮
close the dermal layer, then reapproximate the skin.

144
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:54,990
并且需要确保筋膜缝合线
Also, you need to ensure no omentum is caught

145
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,790
不穿过网膜
in the fascial suture line.

146
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:58,580
缝合吧
Close him up.

147
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:00,710
莫菲  你来做
Murphy, you're lead.

148
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,590
清理周围
Clearing laps.

149
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:11,780
在你检查消化道的时候
I will hold the repaired segment in place

150
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:14,500
我来托着修补好的部分
while you run the bowel for me.

151
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,840
消化道无异常  可以归位了
Bowel is clear - and ready to be repositioned.

152
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,490
肖恩
Shaun?

153
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,700
肖恩  你没事吧
Shaun, is everything all right?

154
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:36,830
我丢了东西
I lost something.

155
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:37,950
在腹腔里吗
In the cavity?

156
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:39,190
不是
No.

157
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,230
但我知道它在哪儿
But I know where it is now.

158
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:54,540
肖恩
Shaun.

159
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:57,800
我之前把手术刀忘在这儿了
I left my scalpel here earlier today.

160
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,160
你应该去做扩散张量成像
You should get Diffusion Tensor Imaging.

161
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,300
DTI吗
A DTI?

162
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:08,810
要准确诊断肿瘤的性质是很难的
Masses are difficult to diagnose accurately.

163
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:15,410
你需要拍更多片子
You should get more imaging.

164
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,010
世人都会犯错
People make mistakes.

165
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:20,450
我不会去的  肖恩
That's not gonna happen, Shaun.

166
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,500
我的手术刀不在这里
My scalpel isn't here.

167
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,170
这回又怎么了
What happened this time?

168
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:39,440
他有内出血
He's got a bleed somewhere.

169
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:41,050
去做胶囊内镜检查整个消化道
I want a capsule endoscopy to check

170
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:43,000
是否有出血点或者渗漏
the entire length of the bowel for bleeding and leaks.

171
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,320
做一份完整的凝血及代谢功能报告
And get me a complete coagulation and metabolic profile.

172
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,190
收到
On it.

173
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:56,680
格拉斯曼医生要死了
Dr. Glassman is dying.

174
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,410
什么
What?

175
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:02,290
你在说什么  他看上去没事啊
What do you mean? He seemed fine.

176
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:06,060
他被诊断出有胶质瘤
They say he has a glioma.

177
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,390
就是脑瘤
That's a brain tumor.

178
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:12,760
他不去做DTI扫描进行确诊
And he won't do a DTI scan to confirm the diagnosis.

179
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,910
他有做二次诊断吗
Did he get a second opinion?

180
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:17,730
有的  但延误  未发现
He has, but delayed or missed

181
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,530
或者误诊的机率
or incorrect diagnosis

182
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:22,130
达到百分之十到二十
has an occurrence rate of 10% to 20%.

183
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:23,820
医生也会犯错
Doctors make mistakes.

184
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,370
肖恩  我不知道你想要我做什么
Shaun, I don't know what you want me to do.

185
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:28,270
我  我想请你先坐下
I-I want you to sit down.

186
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:31,470
当人们想告诉你一些重要的事时
That's what people say

187
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:35,300
他们就会这么说
when they want to tell you something important.

188
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,170
你说他要死了
The part about him dying,

189
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:41,400
这还不重要吗
that wasn't the important part?

190
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:51,300
他不听我的建议
He won't listen to me.

191
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:53,130
他脾气很倔
He is stubborn.

192
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:54,490
-的确很倔  -很倔
- That he is. - Stubborn.

193
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:55,890
他会听你的意见
He will listen to you.

194
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,870
你认识他时间更长
Okay, you have known him longer,

195
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:02,950
你是他的朋友  他信任你
you're his friend, he trusts you.

196
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,270
肖恩  我也不能逼他做任何事
Shaun, I can't make him do anything, either.

197
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,530
你  你是律师
You -- Y-You're an attorney.

198
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,420
我不擅长撒谎或者操纵人
I'm not skilled - at lying or manipulation.

199
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,550
那你想让我怎么办
So you want me to what?

200
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,630
你想让我操纵他吗
You want me to manipulate him?

201
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:21,860
你想让我利用他的关系及过去
You want me to use our relationship and our history -

202
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:25,170
来迫使他去做这件事吗
to trick him into doing this?

203
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:28,960
是的  求你了
Yes, please.

204
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,590
我知道你不会就让他这么去死的
I knew you wouldn't let him die.

205
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:43,980
患者出现弥散性血管内凝血
Our patient has Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation.

206
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,000
有人能告诉我为什么这很糟糕吗
Can anyone tell me why that is very bad?

207
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:48,090
血管内出现弥散性凝血
Blood clots form throughout the blood vessels

208
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:50,170
迅速消耗体内的凝血因子
and rapidly deplete the body's clotting factors,

209
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:51,810
从而导致全身性出血
thereby causing a systematic bleed.

210
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,430
现在我们进退两难
It's also a catch-22.

211
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,830
如果我们对付凝血
If we treat the clotting,

212
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,410
他可能最终会出血至死
he might end up with a terminal bleed.

213
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:58,570
如果我们治疗出血  他会因凝血而死
And if we treat the bleeding, he'll have a terminal clot.

214
00:11:58,570 --> 00:11:59,830
那我们该怎么办
So how do we treat it?

215
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:01,900
我们要找出原因  进行根治
We figure out the cause. Treat the cause.

216
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,430
还是清洁剂造成的伤害吗
More damage from the detergent?

217
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:04,680
边缘很清晰  不是的
Margins were clear. It's not that.

218
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,270
他的脚踝处可能受到挤压伤
He could have a crush injury from his ankle.

219
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:08,940
或者在术中或术后发生细菌感染
Or a bacterial infection he picked up before or during surgery.

220
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,580
有可能是因为服用药物
It might have been set off by drug use.

221
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,010
或者是我们的问题
Or we did this to him.

222
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,060
我说「我们」  其实是指肖恩
And by "We," I mean Shaun.

223
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:20,320
在手术室  他缝合的时候走神了
He spaced out in the O.R. when he was closing,

224
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,660
就和现在差不多
kind of like he is now.

225
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,840
-我在听着呢  -你在敷衍
- I'm listening. - Comforting.

226
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,910
他没有集中注意
He wasn't focused.

227
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,230
他可能当时夹伤了血管  这会造成...
He could've nicked a vessel, which could've caused --

228
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,730
我们说的可是肖恩
Okay, we're talking about Shaun.

229
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:31,780
他确实不怎么说话  但他很专注
Yeah, he's quiet, but he was focused.

230
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,950
他一直都很专注
He's always focused.

231
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,560
他的针脚就像是缝纫机缝出来的
His stitches look like they came out of a sewing machine.

232
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,910
好吧  并发症时有发生
All right. Complications happen.

233
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,820
我们接诊时他就状况很糟
The kid was in pretty bad shape when we got him.

234
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:44,050
医师失误出现的可能性非常低
Physician error is way down on the list of likely causes.

235
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:45,270
挤压伤最有可能
Crush trauma being top.

236
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:48,650
先给他上新鲜冷冻血浆和晶体液
Get him started on fresh frozen plasma and crystalloid fluids.

237
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:55,960
怎么
Yeah?

238
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:58,380
你现在有空吗
You got a second?

239
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:00,910
这是个开放性问题
Well, that's an open question.

240
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:02,550
你找我有什么事
What can I do for you?

241
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:06,410
我有个患者出现弥散性血管内凝血
I got a patient with DIC.

242
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:09,130
有一种可能是手术医师失误
One of the possible causes is surgeon error.

243
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,590
你的患者  你的失误吗
Your patient, your error?

244
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:11,630
是肖恩的
Shaun's.

245
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:15,740
他分心了  在手术中完全走神了
He got distracted - during surgery, spaced out.

246
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:17,420
他平时不这样
It's not like him.

247
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:19,880
他在手术室里从不错过任何细节
One place he never misses a beat is the O.R.

248
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:23,830
发生了什么事吗
Is there anything going on that I should know about?

249
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,790
他听到了一些坏消息
He got some bad news.

250
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:30,040
关于什么的
About what?

251
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:32,010
是私人问题
It's a personal matter.

252
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:36,940
肖恩因为私人问题而分心吗
Shaun was distracted by a personal issue?

253
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,020
怎么  莉亚回来了吗
What, did Lea come back?

254
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,050
她有新男友了吗
She have a new boyfriend?

255
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,330
他的电视被停了吗
His cable get cut off?

256
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,960
我得了无法手术的脑胶质瘤
I have an inoperable glioma.

257
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:51,730
还有一年半可以活
18 months.

258
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,600
亚伦  我很遗憾
Aaron, I am so sorry.

259
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:02,160
我也是
Me, too.

260
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,790
有什么我能做的吗
Is there anything I can do?

261
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,500
我希望有
I wish.

262
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:12,930
你早该告诉我的
You should've told me.

263
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,230
或者至少  你不应该告诉他
Or at least you shouldn't have told him.

264
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:37,280
他的凝血因子依旧没有工作
His coagulation factors are still off.

265
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:38,810
挤压伤不是问题
Crush trauma isn't the issue.

266
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:40,380
他的毒理学检查是阴性
And his tox screen came back clean.

267
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:42,230
-也不是因为嗑药  -我们并不能确定
- It's not drugs, either. - We don't know that.

268
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:43,840
他输了太多血
He's had so many transfusions,

269
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,410
他血管里的血和他来时的血不一样了
the blood in his veins isn't the same blood he came in with.

270
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:47,990
药物可能还在他的器官里造成...
The drugs could still be in his organs causing --

271
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,200
我知道你不想认为
I get that you don't want to think

272
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,500
这可能是由你朋友造成的  但我们必须...
that this could be caused by your friend, but we have to --

273
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,180
这孩子是从兄弟会捉弄活动上来的  喝得烂醉
The kid came directly from a frat hazing, hammered.

274
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,940
他没嗑药的几率有多大
What are the odds he wasn't on drugs?

275
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:56,920
我们应该开始注射咪唑安定
We should start IV midazolam

276
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,080
用碳酸氢钠中和...
and sodium bicarbonate to counteract --

277
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,770
那是服用了安非他命的治疗方法
That's the treatment for amphetamines.

278
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:00,640
如果你的判断是错的
If you're wrong,

279
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,340
可能会导致心律失常  危及生命
that could cause a fatal arrhythmia.

280
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,910
我会弄明白他嗑了什么药的
I'll find out what drugs he's on.

281
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,520
你就准备通过问来弄明白吗
You're going to find out by asking?

282
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,050
布莱克之前对我挺坦诚
Blake was honest with me before.

283
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:13,070
当你不是承认罪行的时候
It's a lot easier to be honest

284
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:14,600
坦诚会容易得多
when you're not confessing to a crime.

285
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,390
在这件事上我们没有太多选择
We don't have a lot of choice in the matter.

286
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:20,000
不是那样的
That's not true.

287
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:23,910
谢谢
Thanks for doing this.

288
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,040
没什么
Yeah, no worries.

289
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,440
我第一眼看到你的时候就注意到你被划伤了
Noticed it was cut when I first saw you.

290
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,940
觉得应该处理一下
Figured it should get cleaned up.

291
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,150
我能抽点血吗
Is it all right if I draw some blood?

292
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:35,920
只是想确保
Just want to make sure

293
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,730
你没有毒素和感染
you don't have any toxins or infections.

294
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:38,540
好
Sure.

295
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:42,370
所以
So,

296
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:46,910
护士说卡登有弥漫性血管内凝血
the nurse said that Caden has DIC.

297
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,200
你知道那是什么吗
Do you know what that is?

298
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,490
简单说就是他的身体
Well, in short, his body is clotting

299
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:53,990
同时在凝块和出血
and hemorrhaging at the same time.

300
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:56,130
如果我们找不到原因
If we can't figure out what's causing it,

301
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:57,050
他就会死
he'll die.

302
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,080
按住三秒
Just hold that there for me.

303
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:06,190
好了
All done.

304
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,490
布莱克  兄弟  你肯定嗑了什么
Blake, buddy, you're on something.

305
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:12,320
你的瞳孔扩张
Your pupils are dilated,

306
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,620
你在20℃的房间汗如雨下
and you're sweating in a 68-degree room.

307
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,990
现在我可以把这个交给警察
Now, I can hand this over to the cops

308
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,940
或者你可以告诉我卡登到底嗑了什么
or you can tell the truth about what Caden's on.

309
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:21,970
摇头丸
Molly.

310
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,600
如果你直接问我的话我会和你说实话的
I would've told you the truth if you'd asked.

311
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,440
抱歉
I'm sorry.

312
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,930
你有时间谈谈吗
You have time to talk?

313
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:38,190
肖恩告诉你了
Shaun told you.

314
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:39,590
是的
He did. Yeah.

315
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,440
我更希望是你亲口告诉我
I wish I would've heard it from you.

316
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,040
对不起
Yeah, I'm sorry.

317
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,440
-我们是朋友  -我明白
- We're friends. - I get it.

318
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:47,420
-我想在你身边陪你  -怎么  你在生我的气
- I want to be there for you. - What, are you mad at me?

319
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,340
是的
Yes.

320
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,330
我应该陪着你的
I'm supposed to be there for you.

321
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:53,320
干什么  要干什么  握住我的手吗
To do what? To do what exactly? Hold my hand?

322
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,970
是的  如果需要的话
Yes, if that's what's needed.

323
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:57,690
好  我只想静静  好吗
Okay, well, what I need is to be left alone, okay?

324
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:58,740
你告诉了肖恩
Well, you told Shaun,

325
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,780
那可真明智
so that was a brilliant strategy.

326
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,090
好了  好了  我明白
Okay, okay, I get it.

327
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:04,280
蠢  蠢  蠢  蠢  好了吧
Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, okay?

328
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,340
有时候当人们知道自己要死了时
Sometimes when people are told they are dying,

329
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:07,500
他们会做蠢事
they do stupid things!

330
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:10,730
有时候他们身边的人会做蠢事
Sometimes people around them do stupid things!

331
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,180
肖恩让你过来的
Shaun told you to come here

332
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:15,610
想劝我做更多影像  对吗
to try to convince me to get more imaging, right?!

333
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:18,610
亚伦  你不能放弃
Aaron, you can't stop fighting.

334
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:24,130
-曼蒂不会让你放... -别
- Maddie wouldn't have wanted you to stop -- - Don't,

335
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:26,110
别  别  你敢
don't, don't, don't you dare.

336
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:28,160
你敢
Don't you dare.

337
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:33,140
你要说什么
What are you gonna say, huh?

338
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,070
曼蒂是个斗士
That Maddie was a fighter?

339
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:39,760
她从不放弃
That she never quit?

340
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:49,470
我很遗憾
I'm sorry.

341
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,520
谢谢
Thank you.

342
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,740
你应该去做个弥散张量成像
And you should get the DTI.

343
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:04,850
不为你
Not for you.

344
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:09,490
你已经接受了你的诊断
You've accepted your diagnosis.

345
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:11,510
但肖恩没有
Shaun hasn't.

346
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:15,950
他需要接受
He needs to.

347
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,590
尼尔
Hey, Neil.

348
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,530
我听说你的一个案子出现了并发症
I heard there was a complication in one of your cases.

349
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,750
卡登·赫里
Caden Hauley?

350
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:29,970
是听说还是你在监控所有莫菲的案子
Heard or have you been monitoring all of Murphy's cases?

351
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:32,070
我监控我部门的所有案子
I monitor all my department's cases.

352
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,930
弥漫性血管内凝血的18岁患者
18-year-old with DIC.

353
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:35,300
知道是什么导致的吗
Any idea what set it off?

354
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,630
有并发症
Complications happen.

355
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:39,690
他来的时候就状况很糟
The kid was in pretty bad shape when he got to us.

356
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,310
我还想知道你为什么同时做了两台手术
I'm also wondering why you were in two surgeries at once.

357
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,950
你留下三个无人看管的新手住院医生
You left three first-years unattended?

358
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:49,240
你知道我们总是这么做的
You know we do this all the time.

359
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,280
如果不这样的话我们无法有效运转
We couldn't function efficiently if we didn't.

360
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,130
我希望卡登能渡过难关
I hope Caden pulls through.

361
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,670
你这么快就预约到了
You got a very quick appointment.

362
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,680
我有后门  肖恩
I have connections, Shaun.

363
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:13,450
你为什么听杰西卡的不听我的
Why did you listen to Jessica but not me?

364
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:15,590
杰西卡也很聪明
Well, Jessica's pretty smart, too.

365
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:18,240
是  但她和你说什么了
Yes, but what did she tell you?

366
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,680
我觉得现在不太适合谈这个
I don't think this is a good time.

367
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,940
什么时候合适
When is a good time?

368
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:25,660
我还有很多要向你学习的地方
I have a lot to learn from you,

369
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:28,630
如果你要死了  就只剩下不到两年的时间学习了
and if you're dying, less than two years to learn.

370
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,010
不好意思让你们久等了
Sorry to keep you waiting.

371
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:37,140
你的影像有点意外
There were some surprises on your images.

372
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,180
之前的诊断是不正确的
The previous diagnosis was incorrect.

373
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:43,500
在你的脑桥上有多形性成胶质细胞瘤
You have a Glioblastoma Multiforme located in your pons.

374
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:45,810
我想不用我来告诉你
I'm sure I don't need to tell you this,

375
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:49,480
但这是最具侵略性的脑癌
but it's the most aggressive form of brain cancer.

376
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:55,500
我们估计还有约三到四个月的时间
We estimate three, maybe four months.

377
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,460
等你准备好了
I can have my assistant get in touch with you

378
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:03,020
我会让我的助手联系你  给你介绍治疗师
to refer you to a therapist when you're ready.

379
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,500
他还是有低血压  血液稀薄
He still has low blood pressure and thin blood,

380
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,690
也就是说对摇头丸的治疗没有起效
which means the treatment for the MDMA didn't work.

381
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:17,260
所以摇头丸不是问题所在
So the Molly wasn't the problem?

382
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,210
肯定没有帮到他  但我们觉得他...
It certainly didn't help him, but now we think he --

383
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:22,260
最好的可能是卡登细菌感染了
Our best guess is Caden has a bacterial infection.

384
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:24,960
谢谢
Thanks.

385
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,990
弥漫性血管内凝血
DIC?

386
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,580
怎么了
What happened there?

387
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:34,840
我们还不确定
Uh, we're not sure yet.

388
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,510
他入院时就病得不轻
He was pretty sick when he came in.

389
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,980
有时候就是会出现并发症的
I guess sometimes complications just happen.

390
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,580
挺会讲话的
Interesting choice of words.

391
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,790
和梅伦德斯医生跟我说的居然如出一辙
Eerily similar - to what Dr. Melendez said to me.

392
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,780
是的  他在讨论鉴别诊断的时候说过
Yeah, he said it during a differential.

393
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,680
我大概是记住了他用的词
I guess the phrasing just stuck with me.

394
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,790
梅伦德斯不像那么放任你们的人
It's not like Melendez to be that laissez-faire.

395
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,000
他一般会想知道每一个细节
He usually likes to know exactly why things happen.

396
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,610
这是我敬佩他的地方之一
One of the traits I admire about him.

397
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:55,560
我们正在想办法搞清楚
Yeah, well, we're trying to figure it out.

398
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:58,030
但到目前为止  培养阴性
But so far, - the cultures are negative.

399
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:59,820
肖恩的关腹操作是教科书式的
Shaun's closing was textbook.

400
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,720
也不像用了什么毒品
Drug use doesn't seem to be a problem.

401
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:05,400
我没意识到是莫菲做的关腹
I didn't realize Murphy did the closing.

402
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,120
他干得漂亮
Good for him.

403
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,150
天啊
Oh, my God.

404
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:31,080
肖恩
Shaun.

405
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:35,230
是的  是的  有很多种不同的解释
Yes, yes, there are - many different explanations.

406
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:38,200
你要我去听听其他意见  我去听了其他意见
You asked me to get a second opinion. I got a second opinion.

407
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,710
你要我去做其他影像检查  我做了其他影像检查
You asked me to get more imaging. I got more imaging.

408
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:42,160
肖恩  你得接受
Shaun, you have to accept --

409
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,990
不  我不接受
No, I don't accept.

410
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:46,040
我不接受  我是对的
I don't accept. I was right.

411
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,220
不  你错了  我要死了  肖恩
No, you were not right. I'm dying, Shaun.

412
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,790
我说过了  医生会犯错
I said doctors make mistakes...

413
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:51,510
-对  他们是犯了错误  -他们犯了错误
- Yeah, they made a mistake. - and they made a mistake.

414
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:53,050
我剩下的时间比我们想得还少
I have less time than we even thought!

415
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:54,430
肖恩是对的  肖恩是对的
Shaun was right. Shaun was right.

416
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:56,410
影像不可靠
Imaging is unreliable.

417
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:57,590
你让我去做的那个影像
The imaging that you asked me to get.

418
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:00,970
影像检查会受到读片的影响
Imaging is subject to interpretation.

419
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:04,900
是的  研究表明专家依靠
Yes, studies have shown that experts rely on --

420
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:07,230
依靠根据经验判断的
on -- on subjective measures

421
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:10,070
-主观的方法  而不是客观的  -够了
- based on experience rather than object - No more.

422
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,490
-而不是客观的  -够了  够了
- Rather than objective - No more, no.

423
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:12,930
停  停  够了  够了
No. No, no. No more. No more.

424
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:15,120
-够了  -有很多一致的理论
- No more. - Many theories consistent with --

425
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,310
你可以做活检来确认
You can do a biopsy to confirm

426
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,740
因为肿瘤看上去都是一样的
because many tumors look alike.

427
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,230
有些是可以治疗的
Some are treatable.

428
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:22,950
-有些是可以治愈的  -求你停下来
- Some are curable. - Stop, will ya?!

429
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,200
有些是可以治愈的  是可以治愈的
Some are curable. They're curable.

430
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,880
住口  求你了  住口  住口  别说了
Stop, please, will ya?! Stop, stop, stop talking!

431
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,400
-住口  -好
- Stop! - Okay.

432
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,590
住口
Stop!

433
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:36,010
我没有伤害你
I am not hurting you.

434
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,580
天啊  停
Oh, my God, stop.

435
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,360
我是在帮你
I'm helping you.

436
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,320
不  不是  你不是在帮我
No, you're not. You're not helping.

437
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:44,490
我不需要理论
I don't need theories.

438
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,940
我不需要白板
I don't need white boards.

439
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,750
我不需要医生
I don't need doctors!

440
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,820
我不想去想那个肿瘤
I don't want to think about the tumor!

441
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:54,120
我不想去想我快死了
I don't want to think about dying!

442
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,490
你知道我要什么吗
You know what I want?

443
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:57,550
你知道我其实想要什么吗  我想  我想
You know what I actually want? I want to -- I want to --

444
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:59,570
我想  开车去很远的地方
I want to go - on a long drive somewhere.

445
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,170
我想  我想吃煎饼
I want to -- I want to eat pancakes.

446
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:02,510
我想看球
I want to watch football.

447
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:05,050
-现在不是赛季  -天啊
- It's not football season. - Oh, my God.

448
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,910
我知道  不是赛季
I know - it's not football season.

449
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:13,100
你的意思是想  想出去玩吗
Do you mean you want to have fun?

450
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:18,820
对
Yeah.

451
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,400
我想出去玩
I want to have fun.

452
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,480
你继续战斗吧
So you can keep fighting.

453
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,330
你要是想  就继续战斗吧
Keep fighting if you want.

454
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:33,810
无用  而且愚蠢
It's futile and it's stupid.

455
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,240
或者  你也可以跟我一起
Or you can come with me.

456
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:05,490
他缺氧多久了
How long has he been hypoxic?

457
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:07,000
五分钟前突然发作
It came on suddenly five minutes ago.

458
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:09,510
他现在用了100%高流量吸氧  数据也上不去
He's on 100% high-flow oxygen, and his numbers aren't budging.

459
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:11,340
他通气正常
He's ventilating fine.

460
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:14,000
他肯定是肺动脉栓塞了
He must have thrombosed his pulmonary artery.

461
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,840
我们得在他心脏停跳之前溶栓
We need to dissolve this clot before his heart stops.

462
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,270
-杰瑞德  准备颈静脉通路  -好
- Jared, prep for jugular access. - On it.

463
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:19,460
50毫克tPA  现在注射
50 milligrams tPA. Infusion now.

464
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:19,460
组织型纤溶酶原激活剂

465
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:21,110
快点  快点  快点
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

466
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:26,580
好玩吗
Is this fun?

467
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:33,240
情人节后的周六
The Saturday after Valentine's Day,

468
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:34,500
一年中她最喜欢的一天
her favorite day of the year,

469
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,280
比她生日还喜欢
even more than her birthday.

470
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:40,000
商会把这地方装饰好
The Chamber of Commerce would decorate this place

471
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:44,950
准备一场没啥意思的自助餐  雇个DJ
and put out a crappy buffet meal, hire a deejay,

472
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,360
我穿上燕尾服
and I'd put on a tux,

473
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:50,330
她穿上黄色的小裙子
and she'd put on a yellow Belle dress,

474
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,080
她...
and she'd...

475
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,690
帮我戴好领结
pin my bow tie on me,

476
00:24:56,690 --> 00:25:00,680
我帮她戴上小小的胸花
and I'd pin a little yellow corsage on her.

477
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:05,790
我们过来  吃饭  跳舞
And we'd come and we'd eat and we'd -- and we'd dance.

478
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:15,000

Oh, you think so, huh?

Well, I'll tell you what.

当然啦  我知道很多
which I know is quite a lot,

你把你爱我的加倍  再加十

我记得当时想  「我知道这个瞬间
And I remember thinking, "This is the moment...

497
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,950
是我闭上眼睛
that I know will be in my mind

498
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:05,360
快要死去时  会想着的那个瞬间」
when I -- when I -- when I close my eyes to die."

499
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:13,290
只是我当时想  那时她肯定坐在我身边
Only I thought - that she'd be sitting there, right next to me,

500
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:17,530
我会听到她再说一遍
and I'd hear her say it one more time.

501
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:27,000
我的玩具手术刀不见了
I lost my toy scalpel.

502
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,870
史蒂夫给我的那个
The one that Steve gave me.

503
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,700
嗯  我觉得也是那把
Yeah, I figured that was the one.

504
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:39,540
我找了一整天
I have been looking for a whole day.

505
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:42,710
我觉得可能它永远离我而去了
I think it may be gone forever.

506
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,630
你死之后可能我还会来这里
Maybe I'll come here when you're dead.

507
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,840
好啊
Okay.

508
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,340
你对你女儿的记忆  足够了吗
Are your memories - of your daughter enough for you?

509
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:06,560
一点都不够
Not even close.

510
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,410
你要不要我再听你说一会儿
Do you need me to listen to you anymore?

511
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:18,780
不用  肖恩  你该回去了
No, Shaun, you should go.

512
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,800
好吧
Okay.

513
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:30,900
还有培养结果没出来
Not all the cultures are back.

514
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:32,970
但既然抗生素对他无效
But since he's not responding to any antibiotics,

515
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:34,020
我们可以排除细菌感染了
we can rule out bacterial.

516
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:35,660
永远不会有完美的解释
It was never a great fit.

517
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:37,330
这最好是手术失误
It's a better fit than surgical error.

518
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:39,730
如果是细菌造成的而且对一切都有抗性
What if it is bacterial but resistant to all --

519
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:40,440
那他得死了
Then he's dead.

520
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:43,310
如果是阵发性睡眠性血红蛋白尿症呢
What about Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria?

521
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:46,030
几率几乎微乎其微
Pnh? The incidence - is literally one in a million.

522
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,980
莫菲弄错的几率能有多大
What's the odds of Murphy screwing up?

523
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:48,840
我信莫菲
I'd put them about that.

524
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,390
不  不是阵发性睡眠性血红蛋白尿症
No, it's not PNH.

525
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:52,010
卡登的流式细胞正常
Caden had normal flow cytometry.

526
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:55,410
蛇毒会引发消耗性凝血病
Exotic snake venom can trigger consumptive coagulopathies.

527
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:56,630
先兆子痫也可以
So can pre-eclampsia,

528
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:59,140
但他没有怀孕也不是条迷人的蛇
but he's not pregnant and he wasn't charming snakes.

529
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:04,330
莫菲有什么想法吗
Murphy, any thoughts here?

530
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,260
你两肋插刀的时候到了
It is kind of your ass on the line.

531
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:30,050
我知道为什么卡登有播散性血管内凝血
I know why Caden has DIC.

532
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:35,980
我挤压了两钳之间的动脉
I squeezed the artery between two clamps.

533
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:38,260
我恐怕弄裂了主动脉壁
I must have ruptured the aortic wall,

534
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:40,340
从而造成了假性动脉瘤
causing a pseudo-aneurysm.

535
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:42,150
是我的错
It was my mistake.

536
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,420
同时
And also...

537
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:50,550
我需要上洗手间
I have to make a bowel movement.

538
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,530
他在撒谎
He's lying.

539
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,630
他要吐了
He's gonna puke.

540
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,850
他要去找格拉斯曼
He's going to Glassman.

541
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:10,540
我告诉梅伦德斯医生我需要去吸收剂
I told Dr. Melendez I had to make a bowel movement.

542
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:13,030
我觉得他信了
I think he believed me.

543
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,670
为你自豪
Color me proud.

544
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:16,990
我有答案了
I have the answer.

545
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:20,100
肖恩我希望你在指你的病人
Shaun, I hope you're referring to your patient,

546
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:21,420
但鉴于你现在在这
but due to the fact that you're here,

547
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:22,650
假装在厕所里
pretending to be in the bathroom,

548
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:24,910
-我有些怀疑  -这是你的答案
- I kind of doubt that. - Yes, it's your answer.

549
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:25,970
我们已经
We already --

550
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:28,800
我们已经有我的答案了  肖恩
We already have my answer, Shaun.

551
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,760
我们不能对你进行活检
We can't do a biopsy on you

552
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,700
因为会有动脉阻碍
because of the arteries in the way,

553
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,300
就像卡登腹部的动脉
like the arteries in Caden's abdomen,

554
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,630
但我们不能移动你脑部的动脉  因为
but we can't move the arteries in your brain because --

555
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,990
我们为什么要去旋转木马
Why did we go to the carousel?

556
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,930
因为你不开心
Because you were sad.

557
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,670
我有什么不想做的
What didn't I want to do?

558
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,360
你不知道答案吗
Do you not know the answers to these questions?

559
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,760
我知道答案  肖恩
I do know the answers, Shaun.

560
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,660
我不认为你知道
I don't think you know the answers to these questions.

561
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:55,050
你没懂我  我要死了
You're not hearing me. I'm dying.

562
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:56,380
还有希望
There's still hope.

563
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,440
肖恩  看着我
Shaun, look at me.

564
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,180
看着我
Look at me, please.

565
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:08,310
我没有希望了
There is no hope for me.

566
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:10,020
希望
I mean, hope?

567
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:12,030
希望是什么
What -- What -- What -- What is hope?

568
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:14,260
你希望四十九号能成功防守
You hope the 49ers find a defense.

569
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,910
你希望4路公交按时到站
You hope the number 4 bus comes on time.

570
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:19,060
不代表他们就会奇迹般知道怎么对战
Doesn't mean they magically learn how to tackle.

571
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:22,210
不代表公交司机就能突然加速
Doesn't mean the bus driver suddenly drives faster.

572
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:27,320
希望与我无关
Hope is irrelevant for me.

573
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:29,950
希望令人痛苦
Hope is painful.

574
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:34,200
我不希望我在所剩的时日里
I don't want to spend what's left of my life

575
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,310
原地无谓打转
chasing my tail around in a circle.

576
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:40,180
你明白吗
You understand?

577
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:47,880
好的
Okay.

578
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:52,160
好的
Okay.

579
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:09,990
你的肿瘤在你头骨的底部
Your tumor is located at the base of your skull.

580
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:16,120
开颅活检可以让我们了解情况
An open cranial biopsy would tell us what's wrong.

581
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:18,500
但会有血管阻碍
But there are blood vessels in the way.

582
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:21,910
活检会导致动脉瘤或是出血
The biopsy would cause an aneurysm or a bleed.

583
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:26,540
但如果我们从你的鼻筛状板进入
But if we go through your nasal cribriform plate,

584
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:30,020
我们可以避开侧方的小脑幕
we can cross the tentorium on the contralateral side

585
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:32,370
避开所有血管
and avoid all those blood vessels.

586
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:38,880
我们可以通过你的鼻腔进行活检
We can do a biopsy through your nose.

587
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,800
你也不会死
You can't die, too.

588
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:58,000
我得去吐了
I have to throw up.

589
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,140
所以我们要怎么做  上报吗
So how do we do this? Do we file a report?

590
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,370
私下跟安德鲁斯交流下吗
Talk to Andrews personally?

591
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:09,810
你要上报肖恩吗
You want to report Shaun?

592
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,680
我不想  但我们必须如此
I don't want to. I think we have to.

593
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,840
不  你很想这样
No, you want to.

594
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,300
而我们也必须这样  如果我们目标
And we'd certainly have to if our sole agenda

595
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,500
是弄走肖恩
would be to take down Shaun

596
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,440
让你少一个竞争对手
and to give you one less person to compete against.

597
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,180
当然  我们还是得「必须」
And certainly, we'd absolutely "Have to"

598
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:24,340
掩盖一个可能的致命手术错误
cover up and bury a possible fatal medical error

599
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:26,610
如果我们的终极目的是保护一个朋友
if our sole agenda was to protect a friend?

600
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:29,900
医院规定肯定会站在那个婊子一侧
Protocol would seem to favor the bitch over the friend.

601
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,130
谢谢
Thanks?

602
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:34,830
我刚刚吐了
I threw up.

603
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,930
我们需要报告失误
We have a duty to report errors

604
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:40,460
这样他们才不会再发生
so they won't happen again.

605
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:42,610
这样才会拯救生命
The process saves lives.

606
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:45,130
我们到底在避免重复什么错误
And exactly what errors are we trying to avoid a repeat of?

607
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:47,850
你担心下次还会有自闭的外科医生
You worried about the next time an autistic surgeon operates

608
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,700
在发现自己的良师益友要死于脑癌后
on a drugged-up frat kid after finding out his mentor

609
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,220
再给一个嗑药的孩子做手术吗
is dying of brain cancer?

610
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:56,250
梅伦德斯医生告诉我们了  肖恩
Dr. Melendez told us, Shaun.

611
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:57,670
我们很抱歉
We're really sorry.

612
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,680
没关系
It's okay.

613
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,170
没关系
It's okay.

614
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:04,710
他会没事的
I think he's going to be okay.

615
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,620
医院规定之所以存在
The protocol exists

616
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:08,450
是为了让我们不会问这种问题
so that we don't ask questions like that.

617
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:10,210
听上去不是个好主意
That seems like a bad idea.

618
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,720
你相信你自己的评价
You trust your judgment.

619
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,180
你相信摩根的评价吗
Do you trust Morgan's judgment?

620
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:15,500
你相信这所医院里所有医生的评价吗
Do you trust the judgment of all the doctors in this building?

621
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:17,600
你可以评价  他们也可以
If you can make judgment calls, so can they.

622
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,140
这就是为什么我们需要规定
That's why we need these rules.

623
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:22,240
医院规定对这所医院里所有人都可以
No, the protocol is fine for everyone in this building,

624
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,540
除了肖恩
except for Shaun.

625
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:26,610
他们会训斥我们任何人但他们会解雇肖恩
They'd reprimand any one of us, but they will fire him.

626
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:28,160
好的
Okay.

627
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:30,980
我们上报吧
We report it.

628
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,010
我们做了调查
We get the investigation,

629
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,940
确保这种事情不会再发生
make sure nothing like this ever happens again.

630
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:36,920
但我们告诉他们是我做的
But we tell them I did it.

631
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,330
他们也会解雇你
They'd fire you, too.

632
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:43,180
这不是什么坏事
It's not a terrible idea.

633
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,520
杰瑞德怎么都会出局的
Jared's out the door either way.

634
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,320
我们可以重新用药物治疗吗
Can we get back to the medicine?

635
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,890
卡登还活着
Caden is still alive.

636
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,140
如果我们可以保持他活着
If we can keep it that way,

637
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,730
就不会有任何流言蜚语
there won't be any review.

638
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:52,410
没有人会问问题
Which means no one will be asking questions,

639
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:53,850
没有人需要给出答案
and no one will have to give answers.

640
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,090
所有都会消失
It all goes away.

641
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:57,350
卡登如果死了我们就说实话
If Caden dies, we tell the truth

642
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:59,620
我们一起面对结果
and we face the consequences together.

643
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:01,700
不
No.

644
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,150
不
No.

645
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:09,020
我以为我找到了我的玩具手术刀
I thought I'd found my toy scalpel.

646
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:14,170
我们需要你回到团队中来  莫菲
We need you to come back to the group, Murphy.

647
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:19,680
给假动脉瘤的成像给我
Get me imaging on that pseudo-aneurysm.

648
00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:33,330
怎么了
What's up?

649
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:35,450
你对莫菲医生的看法
Do you still feel - the same way about Dr. Murphy

650
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:36,490
是不是跟他刚来的时候还是一样的
as when he got here?

651
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:43,270
格拉斯曼医生给了我们一定的担保
Dr. Glassman gave us certain...assurances.

652
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,740
如果肖恩表现得不是非常出色
"If Shaun proves - anything less than excellent,

653
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:49,900
如果他没有展示出我认为他能达到的水平
if Shaun doesn't live up to everything I know he can do,

654
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,220
他会立刻被辞退
he will be immediately released,

655
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:53,100
而我也会辞去我作为
and I will resign my position

656
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:55,110
医院院长的职务
as president of the hospital."

657
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,750
而你也写下来了
And you wrote it down.

658
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:58,530
我确保了这句话会在会议备忘中
I made sure it was in the minutes.

659
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:01,480
肖恩超出了我的预期
Shaun has exceeded my expectations.

660
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:03,310
也超出了我的  然后呢
Mine, as well, and?

661
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:07,680
我对格拉斯曼医生的看法也没有变化
And my feelings about Dr. Glassman have not changed.

662
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:09,830
谢谢你
Thank you.

663
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:17,440
我们需要给他做手术
We need to cut him open.

664
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,950
我们一旦给他手术  他就会死
We cut him open and he dies.

665
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,630
在我们看到动脉之前他就会大出血死亡
He'll bleed out before we can even get the artery exposed.

666
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,590
如果我们不动手术  他会死
If we don't cut him open, he dies.

667
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,990
别动他
Don't cut him open.

668
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,990
莫菲  如果我们不
Murphy, if we don't --

669
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:33,430
我们应该从他的大腿里装一条
We should insert an endovascular graft

670
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,460
血管内移植血管
through his leg instead.

671
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,870
从内部解决问题
Fix it from the inside out.

672
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:40,050
我在腹主动脉大扩张做过
I've done that for large abdominal aorta dilations,

673
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:42,880
但这是一台漫长的假动脉瘤切除
but this is a lengthy dissecting pseudo-aneurysm.

674
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,000
这样会更安全
It's safer.

675
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,560
动脉壁已经受影响了
The aortic wall is already compromised.

676
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,900
可能会完全破裂
Could rupture completely.

677
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:49,840
凯登会在移植血管内的气囊放气的瞬间死亡
Caden could die as soon as we deflate the balloon inside the graft.

678
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,370
但什么都不做会要了他的命
But doing nothing will kill him.

679
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:52,560
也不尽然
Not definitely.

680
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:55,150
凯登也有机会能够
There's still a chance Caden will simply come out of this

681
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,570
不用动手术也能活下来
without any surgical intervention.

682
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:58,620
5%  或者10%的几率
5%, 10% maybe.

683
00:35:58,630 --> 00:35:59,430
不是毫无机会
Not nothing.

684
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:00,540
我们是在知道肖恩闯祸之后
And we're doubling down on Shaun

685
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,250
还要踩上一脚
after we know he caused this problem.

686
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:03,950
这在发病和死亡病例研讨会上能有什么效果
How's that gonna look at an M&M?

687
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,610
我相信肖恩的想法
I trust Shaun's idea.

688
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:09,950
他会犯别人不会犯的错误
He makes mistakes no one else would make,

689
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:13,730
但他有我们从来没想过的救治方法
but he also makes saves none of us would have ever thought of.

690
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:15,450
谢谢
Thank you.

691
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,480
不客气
You're welcome.

692
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,760
我还是觉得你不应该在这里工作
I still don't think you should be working here.

693
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,610
我觉得代价还是太高
I don't think the trade-off is worth it.

694
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,130
我给他准备手术
Well, let's prep him for surgery.

695
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:29,690
抽出导线  雷兹尼克
Pull the guide wire, Reznick.

696
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,560
推入移植血管
I'm passing in the graft.

697
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:41,970
你现在就在假动脉瘤的上方
You're right over the pseudo-aneurysm now.

698
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,520
给气囊充气  释放移植血管
Inflating the balloon to deploy the graft.

699
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,910
放气
Deflating.

700
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:08,260
我能做吗
Can I do it?

701
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,350
太易损了
It's delicate.

702
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:13,300
并没有
No, it's not.

703
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:18,410
要么成功要么失败
And it will either work or it won't work.

704
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,790
如果我的想法错了
If my idea is wrong,

705
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:25,520
他就会在我们完成下一步的时候立刻死亡
he'll die as soon - as we complete this next step.

706
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:29,950
你不应该背负着这种责任
You shouldn't have to live with that.

707
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,040
在这个手术室里发生的一切都是我的责任
Everything that happens in this room is my responsibility.

708
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:42,870
那我们一起来
We'll do it together.

709
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:55,850
放气
Deflating.

710
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:24,180
大家都不要回家
Nobody's going home.

711
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:30,140
我为这个团队以及我们今天所做的感到骄傲
I am proud of this team and what we accomplished today.

712
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,540
我请大家在哈利·霍普喝东西
Drinks are on me at Harry Hopes.

713
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:36,010
我们要庆祝吗
We're celebrating?

714
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,770
今天是场灾难  我们走运而已
Today was a disaster, and we got lucky.

715
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,170
你是对的
You're right.

716
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:44,810
但你走运的时候  你就应该庆祝
But when you get lucky, you celebrate.

717
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,220
走吧
Let's go.

718
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,730
在你的职业生涯的某一刻
At some point in your career,

719
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:04,340
病人会死在你手上的
you're going to kill someone.

720
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:08,370
我希望在事情发生的时候
And I hope for your sake there's a doctor out there

721
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:10,140
会有一名医生相信你
who still believes in you when you do.

722
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,650
一直都在这里
It was there all along.

723
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:31,420
我要去喝酒了  但是我想让你知道
I have to go drinking, but I wanted you to know --

724
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,950
是静脉注射的伤口吗
Is that from an IV?

725
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,280
你做了活检
You did the biopsy.

726
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,200
对
I did.

727
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:46,250
我有一个小型的神经胶质瘤
I have a low-grade glioma.

728
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:48,180
不是脑干胶质瘤吗
Not a GBM?

729
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:50,010
我告诉过你了
I told you --

730
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:51,960
癌症  肖恩  还是癌症
Cancer, Shaun. It's still cancer.

731
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:54,610
我得接受开颅手术
I have to undergo brain surgery,

732
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:57,450
因为不是我自己做  所以很可怕
which is really scary because I'm not the one performing it.

733
00:39:57,450 --> 00:40:00,080
每周五次  为期六周的放疗
Five days a week - for six weeks of radiation,

734
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,780
还有十周的化疗
10 more weeks of chemotherapy.

735
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,360
然后呢
And then?

736
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:08,990
然后
And then...

737
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,350
如果能有点运气
with a little luck...

738
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:15,140
我们下一赛季就能去看超级碗了
you and I can go to the Super Bowl next season.

739
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,010
你不会死的
You're going to live.

740
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,240
还有希望
There's hope.

741
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:39,360
去吧  去跟你的朋友们玩吧
Now go. Go have some fun with your friends.

742
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:43,620
好的  首先我要告诉安德鲁斯我犯的错误
Yes. First I have to tell Dr. Andrews about the mistake I made.

743
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:45,000
肖恩  不可以
Shaun, y-you can't.

744
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:49,740
方案很清楚  报告能救命
Protocol is clear, and reporting saves lives.

745
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:52,370
我听说凯登在恢复中
And I hear Caden is on the road to recovery,

746
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:54,490
所以你的错误并不会太大
so your mistake couldn't have been too bad.

747
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:55,890
不  我犯了错
No, I made a mistake.

748
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:57,450
肖恩  我明白
Shaun, I understand that.

749
00:40:57,450 --> 00:40:59,540
但是安德鲁斯医生会利用这件事情
But Dr. Andrews will use this.

750
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:00,970
你还记得格拉斯曼医生在你被雇佣时
And do you remember the commitment

751
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:03,200
做出的承诺吗
that Dr. Glassman made when you were hired?

752
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,670
我保证你会很出色的对吧  肖恩
I promised you'd be excellent, right, Shaun?

753
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:07,630
你的表现很好
And you have been excellent.

754
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:12,120
你不能给安德鲁斯医生这个借口
You can't give Dr. Andrews this excuse.

755
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:15,580
我没有很好
I was not excellent.

756
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:18,000
这一次  我表现不好
This time, I was bad.

757
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:23,100
但外科医生每一次都要表现出众
And surgeons have to be excellent every time.

758
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,340
对吧  肖恩
Right, Shaun?

759
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,170
你同意他这么做吗
You agree with him?

760
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:30,340
我不想让他为了保住我的工作而撒谎
I'm not gonna ask him to lie to save my job.

761
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:33,480
别这么做
Don't do this.

762
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:37,610
这是肖恩的决定
It's up to Shaun.

763
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:39,850
我相信你的判断
I trust your judgment.

764
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:48,350
我这么做不是要伤害你
I'm not doing this to hurt you.

765
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:49,830
我知道
I know.

766
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:52,180
我们是朋友
We are friends.

767
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:53,560
对
Yes, we are.

768
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,000
我爱你
I love you.

769
00:41:56,970 --> 00:41:58,670
我知道  我也爱你
I know. I love you, too.

770
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:03,350
我更爱你
I love you more.
