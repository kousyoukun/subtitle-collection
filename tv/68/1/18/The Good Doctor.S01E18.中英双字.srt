1
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,260
我还想和你做朋友
I want to be your friend again.

2
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:16,460
为什么  肖恩  怎么了
W-why, Shaun? What happened?

3
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:18,750
人们需要朋友
People need friends.

4
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:19,700
这...
Well...

5
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:22,140
确实如此
Yeah, they do.

6
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,060
但你说你希望我
But you said you wanted me -

7
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,210
别再打扰你  记得吗
to stop interfering, remember?

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,100
你想要空间
You wanted space.

9
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,220
你想  自己犯错
You wanted - to make your own mistakes.

10
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:35,270
比起空间  我更需要朋友
I need a friend more than I need space.

11
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:42,230
你是位优秀的导师  很好的朋友
You were a good mentor and a good friend.

12
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,930
谢谢你  肖恩
Well, thank you, Shaun.

13
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,170
你无法想象这话对我有多重要
You don't know how much it means to me to hear you say that.

14
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,710
但我觉得
But I-I think...

15
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,560
我觉得你可能要找个新导师
I think you may need a new mentor.

16
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,440
我活不久了
I'm dying.

00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:19,470
还剩十二到十八个月
12 to 18 months.

20
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,780
我希望你不要告诉其他人
I'd appreciate it - if you didn't tell anyone, okay?

21
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,110
就让我一人承受
I-I will in my own time.

22
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:26,280
好  你做过全面病情检查吗
Okay. Have you had a full work-up?

23
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:28,020
当然做了
Yes, of course.

24
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,390
有可能是从其他地方
It could be a secondary tumor

25
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,690
转移到你大脑的继发性肿瘤
metastasized to your brain from somewhere else.

26
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:34,050
只发现了这个肿瘤
It's the only tumor found.

27
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:37,040
可能是炎症或者感染症状
It could be an inflammatory or infectious process.

28
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,690
就是肿瘤  肖恩
It was a tumor, Shaun.

29
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:40,040
你该听听不同意见
You should get a second opinion.

30
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,140
肖恩  我当了三十年的神经外科医生
Shaun, I've been a neurosurgeon for 30 years.

31
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:45,420
我想这就是有力的「不同意见」
I think that qualifies as a second opinion.

32
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,040
你该问问其他人的意见
You should get a second opinion.

33
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:49,690
必须搞清楚是不是...
You have to know whether --

34
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:51,640
好好好  肖恩
All right, all right, all right, all right, Shaun.

35
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,030
我会去问问其他人的
I'll get a second opinion.

36
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:53,900
好吗
Okay?

37
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:55,340
好
Okay.

38
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,340
我能去工作了吗
Can I go to work now?

39
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:04,030
好  医生  诊断结果如何
Okay, Doctor, what's your diagnosis?

40
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:05,240
我醉了
I'm drunk.

41
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,310
不是你  是另一位医生
Not you. Other doctor.

42
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,360
鉴于扭曲的程度
Uh, well, given the degree of the rotation

43
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,580
以及骨折情况近乎复合伤
and the fact that the break is almost compound,

44
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,230
我想目前的情况是双踝骨折
I'd say we're dealing with a Bimalleolar

45
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,410
或者是三踝骨折
or Trimalleolar fracture.

46
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:18,120
很好  还有呢
Very good. What else?

47
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:22,600
颜色
Color?

48
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,540
血流堵住了
Blood flow is restricted.

49
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:26,630
他的脚保不住了
His foot's dying.

50
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,320
别啊
Oh, no.

51
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,800
现在得给他复位  按住他的腿
I'm gonna have to reset it now. Hold his leg.

52
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,550
-不不不  -没事的
- No.No, no, no. - No, it's okay.

53
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,280
很快就好
It's just gonna take a second.

54
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,780
你数到三
I need you to count to three.

55
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:36,910
一
One...

56
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:39,190
一  二
One, two --

57
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,490
卡登的腿没事吧
Is Caden's leg gonna be okay?

58
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:48,440
他的腿这样有多久了
How long has his leg been like this

59
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,860
到底发生了什么
and how exactly did it happen?

60
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:52,420
我找到他时他就这样了
Well, he's been like that since I found him.

61
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,790
可能磕马路牙子上了
He probably tripped over a curb or something

62
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:56,850
我就是在路边找到他的
because that's where he was.

63
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,990
你为什么觉得有必要跟我讲两遍
Any reason you felt the need to tell me twice

64
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:00,130
你找到他时的情形吗
that you found him like this?

65
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,330
朴医生  他得做手术
Dr. Park, boy's going to surgery.

66
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:03,330
你要一起来
You're going with.

67
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,350
别走开了
Don't go anywhere.

68
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:18,940
不该给我打麻醉吗
Shouldn't I be asleep for this?

69
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:22,150
你血液中的酒精含量会影响麻醉药
Your blood alcohol level complicates anesthesia

70
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,940
而且你可能有脑震荡
and we think you have a concussion,

71
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,180
所以得让你保持清醒
so we're gonna keep you responsive.

72
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,790
不过有给你做局部神经麻醉
We did give you a regional nerve block,

73
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,630
所以你应该没感觉
so you shouldn't feel anything.

74
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:34,200
很好
Cool.

75
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:37,360
把液晶聚合板在近端倾斜两度
Bend the LCP plate over two degrees on the proximal end.

76
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,630
金冠成形钳
Contouring pliers.

77
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:46,270
血压下降  心跳加速
BP is dropping, heart rate's rising.

78
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,750
给他插管  立刻静脉注射肾上腺素
Let's tube him. IV fluids and phenylephrine, stat.

79
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,830
得停止手术处理其他情况
We need to abort until we can get a handle on what else is going on.

80
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:54,670
做全身CT扫描  查血常规  做超声心动图
Give me a full body CT, full blood panels, and an echo.

81
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,970
我和杰瑞德或许能更快找出问题
I think Jared and I may be able to dig up an answer quicker.

82
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,400
好  快去
Great. Get on it.

83
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:03,100


84
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:03,100

有想法了吗
Come up with anything?

101
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,220
我也没有
Neither did I.

102
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:11,500
我在旧金山市立医院有个神经外科医生朋友
I had a friend, a neurosurgeon, at SF Muni.

103
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,240
她看了扫描图
She looked at the scans.

104
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,070
得出相同的诊断  肖恩
She came to the same diagnosis, Shaun.

105
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:18,930
我有不能动手术的胶质瘤
I have an inoperable glioma.

106
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,240
明白吗
Okay?

107
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:33,700
你该回去工作了  好吗
I think you should go back to work, yes?

108
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:40,430
我得去工作
I need to go to work.

109
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:48,850
理智点
Be reasonable.

110
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:49,920
你说什么
Beg your pardon?

111
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:51,570
明智点
Be reasonable.

112
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,330
我不知道你在说什么
I have no idea what you're talking about.

113
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:54,560
你会明白的
Oh, it'll be clear.

114
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,940
卡登到底怎么了
What the hell happened to Caden?

115
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,410
我不知道  他扭到脚踝了  我
I -- I don't know. He twisted his ankle. I --

116
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:58,670
你之前在撒谎
You lied to me before.

117
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:01,010
现在还在撒谎  你个娇生惯养的孬种
You're lying to me now, you spoiled little coward.

118
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,940
理智点
Be reasonable.

119
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,560
他的朋友受伤了
His friend's hurt.

120
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,180
他很害怕  你把他吓坏了
He's scared, and you're freaking him out.

121
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,250
他生气了  但他说得没错
He's angry, but he's not wrong.

122
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:21,980
卡登情况很糟  我们不知道原因
Caden's in bad shape, and we don't know why.

123
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,310
我们得知道发生了什么
We need to know what happened.

124
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:29,000
不不  别担心他
No, no, don't -- don't worry about him.

125
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,050
跟我说
Talk to me.

126
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,360
说实话
You tell me the truth.

127
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:35,530
不会有麻烦的  你只是在帮你的朋友
You won't get in trouble. You'll just...help a friend.

128
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:37,960
好吧
All right.

129
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,080
我们当时在宣誓入会
We were pledging.

130
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:43,900
要想入会就得通过
And there's -- there's this, uh, wheel of torture thing

131
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,730
「折磨之轮」的考验
you got to do for initiation.

132
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,840
-折磨  -都是些脑残行为
- Torture? - But it's mos-- - it's mostly stupid stuff, dude.

133
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,230
比如  喝一杯橄榄油
It's, like, like, drink a cup of olive oil

134
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:53,790
或者吃一勺肉桂粉
or eat a tablespoon of cinnamon.

135
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:55,130
卡登转到了什么
And what did Caden land on?

136
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:56,100
洗衣服
Laundry.

137
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:57,610
他得洗衣服
He had to do laundry?

138
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:01,990
不不  他得吃洗衣服用的东西
No, like, like, he had to, uh, eat th-those laundry things,

139
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,540
三十秒内看能吃多少
as many as he could in 30 seconds.

140
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,560
洗涤剂  吃洗涤剂
Detergent? Eat detergent?

141
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:07,870
他吃了多少
And how many did he have?

142
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,020
不知道  可能吃了六七...
I don't know. Like six, maybe seven, seven.

143
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,280
他吃了洗涤剂
He ate detergent.

144
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,400
可能会灼穿他的食道
Could've burned a hole through his esophagus

145
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,540
或者他的胃和肠子
or his stomach and intestines.

146
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,850
请堵住那个出血点
Catch that bleeder, please.

147
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:28,480
希望他别生孩子
Let's hope he doesn't breed.

148
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:31,960
怎么  他难道不是蠢蛋吗
What? He isn't an idiot?

149
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,860
消化道都修补好了
We have healthy bowel attached to healthy bowel.

150
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:34,840
我们开始缝合吧
Let's close him up.

151
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,950
梅伦德斯医生
Dr. Melendez?

152
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:38,410
创伤科呼叫你去第二手术室
The trauma S.O.D. is asking for you in O.R. Number 2.

153
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:40,140
有一台紧急开胸手术
We got an emergency thoracotomy.

154
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:41,970
谁能告诉我余下的缝合步骤
Who can give me - the remaining steps for closing?

155
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:44,300
剪断锚定缝线  清理周边  将消化道归位
Cut anchoring sutures, clear laps, and reposition the bowel.

156
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,070
从十二指肠切除处移除夹钳
Remove clamps from the duodenal resection site,

157
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,670
不要遮挡下方动脉
keeping clear of the underlying aorta,

158
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:49,680
缝合筋膜  用环端0号单丝线
close the fascia using a looped 0 monofilament,

159
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,910
缝合真皮层以及表皮
close the dermal layer, then reapproximate the skin.

160
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:57,110
并且需要确保筋膜缝合线
Also, you need to ensure no omentum is caught

161
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,910
不穿过网膜
in the fascial suture line.

162
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,770
缝合吧
Close him up.

163
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,900
莫菲  你来做
Murphy, you're lead.

164
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,780
清理周围
Clearing laps.

165
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,970
在你检查消化道的时候
I will hold the repaired segment in place

166
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:16,690
我来托着修补好的部分
while you run the bowel for me.

167
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:26,030
消化道无异常  可以归位了
Bowel is clear - and ready to be repositioned.

168
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:31,680
肖恩
Shaun?

169
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:34,890
肖恩  你没事吧
Shaun, is everything all right?

170
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,020
我丢了东西
I lost something.

171
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,140
在腹腔里吗
In the cavity?

172
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:41,380
不是
No.

173
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:43,420
但我知道它在哪儿
But I know where it is now.

174
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:56,730
肖恩
Shaun.

175
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,990
我之前把手术刀忘在这儿了
I left my scalpel here earlier today.

176
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:04,350
你应该去做扩散张量成像
You should get Diffusion Tensor Imaging.

177
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,490
DTI吗
A DTI?

178
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:11,000
要准确诊断肿瘤的性质是很难的
Masses are difficult to diagnose accurately.

179
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,600
你需要拍更多片子
You should get more imaging.

180
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,200
世人都会犯错
People make mistakes.

181
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,640
我不会去的  肖恩
That's not gonna happen, Shaun.

182
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,690
我的手术刀不在这里
My scalpel isn't here.

183
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:40,360
这回又怎么了
What happened this time?

184
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,630
他有内出血
He's got a bleed somewhere.

185
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,240
去做胶囊内镜检查整个消化道
I want a capsule endoscopy to check

186
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,190
是否有出血点或者渗漏
the entire length of the bowel for bleeding and leaks.

187
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:47,510
做一份完整的凝血及代谢功能报告
And get me a complete coagulation and metabolic profile.

188
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,380
收到
On it.

189
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,870
格拉斯曼医生要死了
Dr. Glassman is dying.

190
00:09:58,870 --> 00:09:59,600
什么
What?

191
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,480
你在说什么  他看上去没事啊
What do you mean? He seemed fine.

192
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,250
他被诊断出有胶质瘤
They say he has a glioma.

193
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:10,580
就是脑瘤
That's a brain tumor.

194
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:14,950
他不去做DTI扫描进行确诊
And he won't do a DTI scan to confirm the diagnosis.

195
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,100
他有做二次诊断吗
Did he get a second opinion?

196
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,920
有的  但延误  未发现
He has, but delayed or missed

197
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,720
或者误诊的机率
or incorrect diagnosis

198
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,320
达到百分之十到二十
has an occurrence rate of 10% to 20%.

199
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,010
医生也会犯错
Doctors make mistakes.

200
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:27,560
肖恩  我不知道你想要我做什么
Shaun, I don't know what you want me to do.

201
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,460
我  我想请你先坐下
I-I want you to sit down.

202
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,660
当人们想告诉你一些重要的事时
That's what people say

203
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,490
他们就会这么说
when they want to tell you something important.

204
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,360
你说他要死了
The part about him dying,

205
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,590
这还不重要吗
that wasn't the important part?

206
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,490
他不听我的建议
He won't listen to me.

207
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,320
他脾气很倔
He is stubborn.

208
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,680
-的确很倔  -很倔
- That he is. - Stubborn.

209
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,080
他会听你的意见
He will listen to you.

210
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:02,060
你认识他时间更长
Okay, you have known him longer,

211
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,140
你是他的朋友  他信任你
you're his friend, he trusts you.

212
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,460
肖恩  我也不能逼他做任何事
Shaun, I can't make him do anything, either.

213
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:08,720
你  你是律师
You -- Y-You're an attorney.

214
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:12,610
我不擅长撒谎或者操纵人
I'm not skilled - at lying or manipulation.

215
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:15,740
那你想让我怎么办
So you want me to what?

216
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:19,820
你想让我操纵他吗
You want me to manipulate him?

217
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,050
你想让我利用他的关系及过去
You want me to use our relationship and our history -

218
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:27,360
来迫使他去做这件事吗
to trick him into doing this?

219
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,150
是的  求你了
Yes, please.

220
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:39,780
我知道你不会就让他这么去死的
I knew you wouldn't let him die.

221
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,170
患者出现弥散性血管内凝血
Our patient has Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation.

222
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:48,190
有人能告诉我为什么这很糟糕吗
Can anyone tell me why that is very bad?

223
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,280
血管内出现弥散性凝血
Blood clots form throughout the blood vessels

224
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,360
迅速消耗体内的凝血因子
and rapidly deplete the body's clotting factors,

225
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,000
从而导致全身性出血
thereby causing a systematic bleed.

226
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,620
现在我们进退两难
It's also a catch-22.

227
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:57,020
如果我们对付凝血
If we treat the clotting,

228
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,600
他可能最终会出血至死
he might end up with a terminal bleed.

229
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,760
如果我们治疗出血  他会因凝血而死
And if we treat the bleeding, he'll have a terminal clot.

230
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,020
那我们该怎么办
So how do we treat it?

231
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,090
我们要找出原因  进行根治
We figure out the cause. Treat the cause.

232
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,620
还是洗涤剂造成的伤害吗
More damage from the detergent?

233
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:06,870
边缘很清晰  不是的
Margins were clear. It's not that.

234
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:08,460
他的脚踝处可能受到挤压伤
He could have a crush injury from his ankle.

235
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:11,130
或者在术中或术后发生细菌感染
Or a bacterial infection he picked up before or during surgery.

236
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,770
有可能是因为服用药物
It might have been set off by drug use.

237
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:14,200
或者是我们的问题
Or we did this to him.

238
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:19,250
我说「我们」  其实是指肖恩
And by "We," I mean Shaun.

239
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:22,700
在手术室  他缝合的时候走神了
He spaced out in the O.R. when he was closing,

240
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,040
就和现在差不多
kind of like he is now.

241
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,220
-我在听着呢  -你在敷衍
- I'm listening. - Comforting.

242
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,290
他没有集中注意
He wasn't focused.

243
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:28,610
他可能当时夹伤了血管  这会造成...
He could've nicked a vessel, which could've caused --

244
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:30,110
我们说的可是肖恩
Okay, we're talking about Shaun.

245
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:34,160
他确实不怎么说话  但他很专注
Yeah, he's quiet, but he was focused.

246
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,330
他一直都很专注
He's always focused.

247
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,940
他的针脚就像是缝纫机缝出来的
His stitches look like they came out of a sewing machine.

248
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:41,160
好吧  并发症时有发生
All right. Complications happen.

249
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,070
我们接诊时他就状况很糟
The kid was in pretty bad shape when we got him.

250
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:46,300
医师失误出现的可能性非常低
Physician error is way down on the list of likely causes.

251
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,520
挤压伤最有可能
Crush trauma being top.

252
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,900
先给他上新鲜冷冻血浆和晶体液
Get him started on fresh frozen plasma and crystalloid fluids.

253
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,210
怎么
Yeah?

254
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,630
你现在有空吗
You got a second?

255
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,160
这是个开放性问题
Well, that's an open question.

256
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,800
你找我有什么事
What can I do for you?

257
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,660
我有个患者出现弥散性血管内凝血
I got a patient with DIC.

258
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,380
有一种可能是手术医师失误
One of the possible causes is surgeon error.

259
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,840
你的患者  你的失误吗
Your patient, your error?

260
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,880
是肖恩的
Shaun's.

261
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:17,990
他分心了  在手术中完全走神了
He got distracted - during surgery, spaced out.

262
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:19,670
他平时不这样
It's not like him.

263
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,130
他在手术室里从不错过任何细节
One place he never misses a beat is the O.R.

264
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,080
发生了什么事吗
Is there anything going on that I should know about?

265
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,040
他听到了一些坏消息
He got some bad news.

266
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,290
关于什么的
About what?

267
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,260
是私人问题
It's a personal matter.

268
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,190
肖恩因为私人问题而分心吗
Shaun was distracted by a personal issue?

269
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,270
怎么  莉亚回来了吗
What, did Lea come back?

270
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,300
她有新男友了吗
She have a new boyfriend?

271
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,580
他的电视被停了吗
His cable get cut off?

272
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:51,210
我得了无法手术的脑胶质瘤
I have an inoperable glioma.

273
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:53,980
还有一年半可以活
18 months.

274
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:01,850
亚伦  我很遗憾
Aaron, I am so sorry.

275
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,410
我也是
Me, too.

276
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:08,040
有什么我能做的吗
Is there anything I can do?

277
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:10,750
我希望有
I wish.

278
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,180
你早该告诉我的
You should've told me.

279
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:20,480
或者至少  你不应该告诉他
Or at least you shouldn't have told him.

280
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,450
他的凝血因子依旧没有工作
His coagulation factors are still off.

281
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,980
挤压伤不是问题
Crush trauma isn't the issue.

282
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,550
他的毒理学检查是阴性
And his tox screen came back clean.

283
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,400
-也不是因为嗑药  -我们并不能确定
- It's not drugs, either. - We don't know that.

284
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,010
他输了太多血
He's had so many transfusions,

285
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:50,580
他血管里的血和来时的血不一样了
the blood in his veins isn't the same blood he came in with.

286
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,160
药物可能还在他的器官里造成...
The drugs could still be in his organs causing --

287
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,370
我知道你不想认为
I get that you don't want to think

288
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:54,670
这可能是由你朋友造成的  但我们必须...
that this could be caused by your friend, but we have to --

289
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:57,350
这孩子是从兄弟会整蛊活动上来的  喝得烂醉
The kid came directly from a frat hazing, hammered.

290
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:59,110
他没嗑药的几率有多大
What are the odds he wasn't on drugs?

291
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,090
我们应该开始注射咪唑安定
We should start IV midazolam

292
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:02,250
用碳酸氢钠中和...
and sodium bicarbonate to counteract --

293
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,940
那是服用了安非他命的治疗方法
That's the treatment for amphetamines.

294
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:04,810
如果你的判断是错的
If you're wrong,

295
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,510
可能会导致心律失常  危及生命
that could cause a fatal arrhythmia.

296
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:08,080
我会弄明白他嗑了什么药的
I'll find out what drugs he's on.

297
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:14,590
你就准备通过问来弄明白吗
You're going to find out by asking?

298
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,120
布莱克之前对我挺坦诚
Blake was honest with me before.

299
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,140
当你不是承认罪行的时候
It's a lot easier to be honest

300
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,670
坦诚会容易得多
when you're not confessing to a crime.

301
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:20,460
在这件事上我们没有太多选择
We don't have a lot of choice in the matter.

302
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,070
不是那样的
That's not true.

303
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,980
谢谢
Thanks for doing this.

304
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,110
没什么
Yeah, no worries.

305
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:33,510
我第一眼看到你的时候就注意到你被划伤了
Noticed it was cut when I first saw you.

306
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:35,010
觉得应该处理一下
Figured it should get cleaned up.

307
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:39,220
我能抽点血吗
Is it all right if I draw some blood?

308
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:39,990
只是想确保
Just want to make sure

309
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:41,800
你没有毒素和感染
you don't have any toxins or infections.

310
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,610
好
Sure.

311
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,440
所以
So,

312
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,980
护士说卡登有弥散性血管内凝血
the nurse said that Caden has DIC.

313
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,270
你知道那是什么吗
Do you know what that is?

314
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:56,560
简单说就是他的身体
Well, in short, his body is clotting

315
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,060
同时在凝块和出血
and hemorrhaging at the same time.

316
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,200
如果我们找不到原因
If we can't figure out what's causing it,

317
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,120
他就会死
he'll die.

318
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:08,150
按住三秒
Just hold that there for me.

319
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,260
好了
All done.

320
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:15,560
布莱克  兄弟  你肯定嗑了什么
Blake, buddy, you're on something.

321
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,390
你的瞳孔扩张
Your pupils are dilated,

322
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:18,690
你在20℃的房间汗如雨下
and you're sweating in a 68-degree room.

323
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:20,060
现在我可以把这个交给警察
Now, I can hand this over to the cops

324
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:23,010
或者你可以告诉我卡登到底嗑了什么
or you can tell the truth about what Caden's on.

325
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,040
摇头丸
Molly.

326
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,670
如果你直接问我的话我会和你说实话的
I would've told you the truth if you'd asked.

327
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:34,510
抱歉
I'm sorry.

328
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:38,000
你有时间谈谈吗
You have time to talk?

329
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,070
肖恩告诉你了
Shaun told you.

330
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:43,470
是的
He did. Yeah.

331
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,320
我更希望是你亲口告诉我
I wish I would've heard it from you.

332
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,920
对不起
Yeah, I'm sorry.

333
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,320
-我们是朋友  -我明白
- We're friends. - I get it.

334
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:51,300
-我想在你身边陪你  -怎么  你在生我的气
- I want to be there for you. - What, are you mad at me?

335
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,220
是的
Yes.

336
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,210
我应该陪着你的
I'm supposed to be there for you.

337
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:57,200
干什么  要干什么  握住我的手吗
To do what? To do what exactly? Hold my hand?

338
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,850
是的  如果需要的话
Yes, if that's what's needed.

339
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:01,570
好  我只想静静  好吗
Okay, well, what I need is to be left alone, okay?

340
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:02,620
你告诉了肖恩
Well, you told Shaun,

341
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:04,660
那可真明智
so that was a brilliant strategy.

342
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:05,970
好了  好了  我明白
Okay, okay, I get it.

343
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:08,160
蠢  蠢  蠢  蠢  好了吧
Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, okay?

344
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,220
有时候当人们知道自己要死了时
Sometimes when people are told they are dying,

345
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,380
他们会做蠢事
they do stupid things!

346
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:14,610
有时候他们身边的人会做蠢事
Sometimes people around them do stupid things!

347
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,060
肖恩让你过来的
Shaun told you to come here

348
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:19,490
想劝我做更多影像  对吗
to try to convince me to get more imaging, right?!

349
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:22,490
亚伦  你不能放弃
Aaron, you can't stop fighting.

350
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:28,010
-曼蒂不会让你放... -别
- Maddie wouldn't have wanted you to stop -- - Don't,

351
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:29,990
别  别  你敢
don't, don't, don't you dare.

352
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:32,040
你敢
Don't you dare.

353
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:37,020
你要说什么
What are you gonna say, huh?

354
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,950
曼蒂是个斗士
That Maddie was a fighter?

355
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:43,640
她从不放弃
That she never quit?

356
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:53,350
我很遗憾
I'm sorry.

357
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,400
谢谢
Thank you.

358
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:05,620
你应该去做个弥散张量成像
And you should get the DTI.

359
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:08,730
不为你
Not for you.

360
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:13,370
你已经接受了你的诊断
You've accepted your diagnosis.

361
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:15,390
但肖恩没有
Shaun hasn't.

362
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:19,830
他需要接受
He needs to.

363
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,470
尼尔
Hey, Neil.

364
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,410
我听说你的一个案子出现了并发症
I heard there was a complication in one of your cases.

365
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,630
卡登·赫里
Caden Hauley?

366
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:33,850
是听说还是你在监控所有莫菲的案子
Heard or have you been monitoring all of Murphy's cases?

367
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:35,950
我监控我部门的所有案子
I monitor all my department's cases.

368
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:37,810
弥散性血管内凝血的18岁患者
18-year-old with DIC.

369
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:39,180
知道是什么导致的吗
Any idea what set it off?

370
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,510
有并发症
Complications happen.

371
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:43,570
他来的时候就状况很糟
The kid was in pretty bad shape when he got to us.

372
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,190
我还想知道你为什么同时做了两台手术
I'm also wondering why you were in two surgeries at once.

373
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:49,830
你留下三个无人看管的新手住院医生
You left three first-years unattended?

374
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:53,120
你知道我们总是这么做的
You know we do this all the time.

375
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,160
如果不这样的话我们无法有效运转
We couldn't function efficiently if we didn't.

376
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,010
我希望卡登能渡过难关
I hope Caden pulls through.

377
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:09,550
你这么快就预约到了
You got a very quick appointment.

378
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,560
我有后门  肖恩
I have connections, Shaun.

379
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:17,330
你为什么听杰西卡的不听我的
Why did you listen to Jessica but not me?

380
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,470
杰西卡也很聪明
Well, Jessica's pretty smart, too.

381
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:22,120
是  但她和你说什么了
Yes, but what did she tell you?

382
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,560
我觉得现在不太适合谈这个
I don't think this is a good time.

383
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,820
什么时候合适
When is a good time?

384
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:29,540
我还有很多要向你学习的地方
I have a lot to learn from you,

385
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:32,510
如果你要死了  就只剩下不到两年的时间学习了
and if you're dying, less than two years to learn.

386
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,890
不好意思让你们久等了
Sorry to keep you waiting.

387
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:41,020
你的影像有点意外
There were some surprises on your images.

388
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,060
之前的诊断是不正确的
The previous diagnosis was incorrect.

389
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:47,380
在你的脑桥上有多形性成胶质细胞瘤
You have a Glioblastoma Multiforme located in your pons.

390
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:49,690
我想不用我来告诉你
I'm sure I don't need to tell you this,

391
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:53,360
但这是最具侵略性的脑癌
but it's the most aggressive form of brain cancer.

392
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:59,380
我们估计还有三到四个月的时间
We estimate three, maybe four months.

393
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,340
等你准备好了  我会让助手联系你
I can have my assistant get in touch with you

394
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,900
给你介绍治疗师
to refer you to a therapist when you're ready.

395
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,260
他还是有低血压  血液稀薄
He still has low blood pressure and thin blood,

396
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,450
也就是说对摇头丸的治疗没有起效
which means the treatment for the MDMA didn't work.

397
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:23,020
所以摇头丸不是问题所在
So the Molly wasn't the problem?

398
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,970
肯定没有帮到他  但我们觉得他...
It certainly didn't help him, but now we think he --

399
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:28,020
最好的可能是卡登细菌感染了
Our best guess is Caden has a bacterial infection.

400
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:30,720
谢谢
Thanks.

401
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,750
弥散性血管内凝血
DIC?

402
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,340
怎么了
What happened there?

403
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:40,600
我们还不确定
Uh, we're not sure yet.

404
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,270
他入院时就病得不轻
He was pretty sick when he came in.

405
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:44,740
有时候就是会出现并发症的
I guess sometimes complications just happen.

406
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,340
挺会讲话的
Interesting choice of words.

407
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,550
和梅伦德斯医生跟我说的居然如出一辙
Eerily similar - to what Dr. Melendez said to me.

408
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,540
是的  他在讨论鉴别诊断的时候说过
Yeah, he said it during a differential.

409
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,440
我大概是记住了他用的词
I guess the phrasing just stuck with me.

410
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,550
梅伦德斯不像那么放任你们的人
It's not like Melendez to be that laissez-faire.

411
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:57,760
他一般会想知道每一个细节
He usually likes to know exactly why things happen.

412
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,370
这是我敬佩他的地方之一
One of the traits I admire about him.

413
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:01,320
我们正在想办法搞清楚
Yeah, well, we're trying to figure it out.

414
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:03,790
但到目前为止  培养阴性
But so far, - the cultures are negative.

415
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:05,580
肖恩的关腹操作是教科书式的
Shaun's closing was textbook.

416
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,480
也不像用了什么毒品
Drug use doesn't seem to be a problem.

417
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:11,160
我没意识到是莫菲做的关腹
I didn't realize Murphy did the closing.

418
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,740
他干得漂亮
Good for him.

419
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,770
天啊
Oh, my God.

420
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:36,700
肖恩
Shaun.

421
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,850
是的  是的  有很多种不同的解释
Yes, yes, there are - many different explanations.

422
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:43,820
你要我去听听其他意见  我去听了其他意见
You asked me to get a second opinion. I got a second opinion.

423
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:46,330
你要我去做其他影像检查  我做了其他影像检查
You asked me to get more imaging. I got more imaging.

424
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:47,780
肖恩  你得接受
Shaun, you have to accept --

425
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,610
不  我不接受
No, I don't accept.

426
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:51,660
我不接受  我是对的
I don't accept. I was right.

427
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,840
不  你错了  我要死了  肖恩
No, you were not right. I'm dying, Shaun.

428
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,410
我说过了  医生会犯错
I said doctors make mistakes...

429
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:57,150
-对  他们是犯了错误  -他们犯了错误
- Yeah, they made a mistake. - and they made a mistake.

430
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:58,670
我剩下的时间比我们想得还少
I have less time than we even thought!

431
00:21:57,130 --> 00:22:00,050
肖恩是对的  肖恩是对的
Shaun was right. Shaun was right.

432
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:02,030
影像不可靠
Imaging is unreliable.

433
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,210
你让我去做的那个影像
The imaging that you asked me to get.

434
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:06,590
影像检查会受到读片的影响
Imaging is subject to interpretation.

435
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:10,520
是的  研究表明专家依靠
Yes, studies have shown that experts rely on --

436
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:12,850
依靠根据经验判断的
on -- on subjective measures

437
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:15,690
-主观的方法  而不是客观的  -够了
- based on experience rather than object - No more.

438
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:17,110
-而不是客观的  -够了  够了
- Rather than objective - No more, no.

439
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,550
停  停  够了  够了
No. No, no. No more. No more.

440
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:20,740
-够了  -有很多一致的理论
- No more. - Many theories consistent with --

441
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,930
你可以做活检来确认
You can do a biopsy to confirm

442
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:24,360
因为肿瘤看上去都是一样的
because many tumors look alike.

443
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,850
有些是可以治疗的
Some are treatable.

444
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:28,570
-有些是可以治愈的  -求你停下来
- Some are curable. - Stop, will ya?!

445
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:29,820
有些是可以治愈的  是可以治愈的
Some are curable. They're curable.

446
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:32,500
住口  求你了  住口  住口  别说了
Stop, please, will ya?! Stop, stop, stop talking!

447
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,020
-住口  -好
- Stop! - Okay.

448
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,210
住口
Stop!

449
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,630
我没有伤害你
I am not hurting you.

450
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,200
天啊  停
Oh, my God, stop.

451
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,980
我是在帮你
I'm helping you.

452
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,940
不  不是  你不是在帮我
No, you're not. You're not helping.

453
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:50,110
我不需要理论
I don't need theories.

454
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:52,560
我不需要白板
I don't need white boards.

455
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,370
我不需要医生
I don't need doctors!

456
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,440
我不想去想那个肿瘤
I don't want to think about the tumor!

457
00:22:57,450 --> 00:22:59,740
我不想去想我快死了
I don't want to think about dying!

458
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,110
你知道我要什么吗
You know what I want?

459
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:03,170
你知道我其实想要什么吗  我想  我想
You know what I actually want? I want to -- I want to --

460
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:05,190
我想  开车去很远的地方
I want to go - on a long drive somewhere.

461
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,790
我想  我想吃煎饼
I want to -- I want to eat pancakes.

462
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:08,130
我想看球
I want to watch football.

463
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:10,670
-现在不是赛季  -天啊
- It's not football season. - Oh, my God.

464
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:12,530
我知道  不是赛季
I know - it's not football season.

465
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,720
你的意思是想  想出去玩吗
Do you mean you want to have fun?

466
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,440
对
Yeah.

467
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,020
我想出去玩
I want to have fun.

468
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,100
你继续战斗吧
So you can keep fighting.

469
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,950
你要是想  就继续战斗吧
Keep fighting if you want.

470
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,430
无用  而且愚蠢
It's futile and it's stupid.

471
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,860
或者  你也可以跟我一起
Or you can come with me.

472
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:11,110
他缺氧多久了
How long has he been hypoxic?

473
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:12,620
五分钟前突然发作
It came on suddenly five minutes ago.

474
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:15,130
他现在用了100%高流量吸氧  数据也上不去
He's on 100% high-flow oxygen, and his numbers aren't budging.

475
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:16,960
他通气正常
He's ventilating fine.

476
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:19,620
他肯定是肺动脉栓塞了
He must have thrombosed his pulmonary artery.

477
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,460
我们得在他心脏停跳之前溶栓
We need to dissolve this clot before his heart stops.

478
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,890
-杰瑞德  准备颈静脉通路  -好
- Jared, prep for jugular access. - On it.

479
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:25,080
50毫克tPA  现在注射
50 milligrams tPA. Infusion now.

480
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:25,080
组织型纤溶酶原激活剂

481
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:26,730
快点  快点  快点
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

482
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,200
好玩吗
Is this fun?

483
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:38,860
情人节后的周六
The Saturday after Valentine's Day,

484
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:40,120
一年中她最喜欢的一天
her favorite day of the year,

485
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,900
比她生日还喜欢
even more than her birthday.

486
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:45,620
商会把这地方装饰好
The Chamber of Commerce would decorate this place

487
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:50,570
准备一场没啥意思的自助餐  雇个DJ
and put out a crappy buffet meal, hire a deejay,

488
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,980
我穿上燕尾服
and I'd put on a tux,

489
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:55,950
她穿上黄色的小裙子
and she'd put on a yellow Belle dress,

490
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:57,700
她...
and she'd...

491
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:02,310
帮我戴好领结
pin my bow tie on me,

492
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:06,300
我帮她戴上小小的胸花
and I'd pin a little yellow corsage on her.

493
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:11,410
我们过来  吃饭  跳舞
And we'd come and we'd eat and we'd -- and we'd dance.

494
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:20,620
BGM: Your Smiling Face by James Taylor

495
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:18,100
? Whenever I see your smiling face ?

496
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,120
? I have to smile myself ?

497
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,900
? Because I love you ?

498
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,120
? Yes, I do ?

499
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,120
我爱你  亲爱的
I love you, sweetie.

500
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,580
我更爱你
I love you more.

501
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,520
你这么想吗
Oh, you think so, huh?

502
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,080
告诉你哦
Well, I'll tell you what.

503
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:34,590
你爱我多少
You can take how much you love me,

504
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,420
当然啦  我知道很多
which I know is quite a lot,

505
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:40,210
你把你爱我的加倍  再加十
and then you can double it, and then you can add 10,

506
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:42,400
就是我有多爱你
and that's how much I love you.

507
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:48,990
? Tell me how much longer, if it grows stronger every day ?

508
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,840
我更爱你
I love you more.

509
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:51,560
? Oh, how much longer? ?

510
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:54,900
? I thought I was in love a couple of times before ?

511
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,440
? With the girl next door ?

512
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:00,370
我记得当时想
And I remember thinking,

513
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,690
「这个瞬间
"This is the moment...

514
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,570
当我闭上眼睛即将与世长辞时
that I know will be in my mind

515
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:10,980
我会永远铭记这个瞬间」
when I -- when I -- when I close my eyes to die."

516
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:18,910
我只希望到时她能坐在我身边
Only I thought - that she'd be sitting there, right next to me,

517
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:23,150
我会听到她再说一遍
and I'd hear her say it one more time.

518
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,620
我的玩具手术刀不见了
I lost my toy scalpel.

519
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,490
史蒂夫给我的那个
The one that Steve gave me.

520
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,320
嗯  我觉得也是那把
Yeah, I figured that was the one.

521
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,160
我找了一整天
I have been looking for a whole day.

522
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:48,330
我觉得可能它永远离我而去了
I think it may be gone forever.

523
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:57,250
你死之后可能我还会来这里
Maybe I'll come here when you're dead.

524
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,460
好啊
Okay.

525
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:07,960
你对你女儿的记忆  足够了吗
Are your memories - of your daughter enough for you?

526
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:12,180
一点都不够
Not even close.

527
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,030
你要不要我再听你说一会儿
Do you need me to listen to you anymore?

528
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:24,400
不用  肖恩  你该回去了
No, Shaun, you should go.

529
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,420
好吧
Okay.

530
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,450
还有培养结果没出来
Not all the cultures are back.

531
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,520
但既然抗生素对他无效
But since he's not responding to any antibiotics,

532
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,570
我们可以排除细菌感染了
we can rule out bacterial.

533
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,210
永远不会有完美的解释
It was never a great fit.

534
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,880
最好是手术失误
It's a better fit than surgical error.

535
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,280
如果是细菌造成的而且对一切都有抗性
What if it is bacterial but resistant to all --

536
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:47,990
那他得死了
Then he's dead.

537
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:50,860
如果是阵发性睡眠性血红蛋白尿症呢
What about Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria?

538
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:53,580
几率几乎微乎其微
Pnh? The incidence - is literally one in a million.

539
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:55,530
莫菲弄错的几率能有多大
What's the odds of Murphy screwing up?

540
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:56,390
我信莫菲
I'd put them about that.

541
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:57,940
不  不是阵发性睡眠性血红蛋白尿症
No, it's not PNH.

542
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,560
卡登的流式细胞正常
Caden had normal flow cytometry.

543
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:02,960
蛇毒会引发消耗性凝血病
Exotic snake venom can trigger consumptive coagulopathies.

544
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,180
先兆子痫也可以
So can pre-eclampsia,

545
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:06,690
但他没有怀孕也不是条迷人的蛇
but he's not pregnant and he wasn't charming snakes.

546
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:11,880
莫菲有什么想法吗
Murphy, any thoughts here?

547
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,810
你两肋插刀的时候到了
It is kind of your ass on the line.

548
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:37,600
我知道为什么卡登有弥散性血管内凝血
I know why Caden has DIC.

549
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:43,530
我挤压了两钳之间的动脉
I squeezed the artery between two clamps.

550
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:45,810
我恐怕弄裂了主动脉壁
I must have ruptured the aortic wall,

551
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:47,890
从而造成了假性动脉瘤
causing a pseudo-aneurysm.

552
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:49,700
是我的错
It was my mistake.

553
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:52,970
同时
And also...

554
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,100
我需要上洗手间
I have to make a bowel movement.

555
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:06,080
他在撒谎
He's lying.

556
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:08,180
他要吐了
He's gonna puke.

557
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:11,400
他要去找格拉斯曼
He's going to Glassman.

558
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:18,090
我告诉梅伦德斯医生我需要去排便
I told Dr. Melendez I had to make a bowel movement.

559
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:20,580
我觉得他信了
I think he believed me.

560
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:22,220
为你自豪
Color me proud.

561
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,540
我有答案了
I have the answer.

562
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,650
肖恩我希望你在指病人
Shaun, I hope you're referring to your patient,

563
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:28,970
但鉴于你现在在这
but due to the fact that you're here,

564
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,200
假装在厕所里
pretending to be in the bathroom,

565
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,460
-我有些怀疑  -这是你的答案
- I kind of doubt that. - Yes, it's your answer.

566
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,520
我们已经
We already --

567
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,350
我们已经有我的答案了  肖恩
We already have my answer, Shaun.

568
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:39,310
我们不能对你进行活检
We can't do a biopsy on you

569
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:41,250
因为会有动脉阻碍
because of the arteries in the way,

570
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:43,850
就像卡登腹部的动脉
like the arteries in Caden's abdomen,

571
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:46,180
但我们不能移动你脑部的动脉  因为
but we can't move the arteries in your brain because --

572
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:48,540
我们为什么要去旋转木马
Why did we go to the carousel?

573
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:51,480
因为你不开心
Because you were sad.

574
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:53,220
我有什么不想做的
What didn't I want to do?

575
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:56,910
你不知道答案吗
Do you not know the answers to these questions?

576
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:58,310
我知道答案  肖恩
I do know the answers, Shaun.

577
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:00,210
我不认为你知道
I don't think you know the answers to these questions.

578
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:02,600
你没懂我  我要死了
You're not hearing me. I'm dying.

579
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,930
还有希望
There's still hope.

580
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:06,990
肖恩  看着我
Shaun, look at me.

581
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:09,730
看着我
Look at me, please.

582
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:15,860
我没有希望了
There is no hope for me.

583
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:17,570
希望
I mean, hope?

584
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:19,580
希望是什么
What -- What -- What -- What is hope?

585
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:21,810
你希望四十九号能成功防守
You hope the 49ers find a defense.

586
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:24,460
你希望四路公交按时到站
You hope the number 4 bus comes on time.

587
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:26,610
不代表他们就会奇迹般知道怎么对战
Doesn't mean they magically learn how to tackle.

588
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:29,760
不代表公交司机就能突然加速
Doesn't mean the bus driver suddenly drives faster.

589
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,870
希望与我无关
Hope is irrelevant for me.

590
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:37,500
希望令人痛苦
Hope is painful.

591
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:41,750
我不希望我在所剩的时日里
I don't want to spend what's left of my life

592
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:44,860
原地无谓打转
chasing my tail around in a circle.

593
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,730
你明白吗
You understand?

594
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:55,430
好的
Okay.

595
00:30:58,780 --> 00:30:59,710
好的
Okay.

596
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:17,540
你的肿瘤在头骨的底部
Your tumor is located at the base of your skull.

597
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:23,670
开颅活检可以让我们了解情况
An open cranial biopsy would tell us what's wrong.

598
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,050
但会有血管阻碍
But there are blood vessels in the way.

599
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:29,460
活检会导致动脉瘤或是出血
The biopsy would cause an aneurysm or a bleed.

600
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:34,090
但如果我们从你的鼻筛状板进入
But if we go through your nasal cribriform plate,

601
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:37,570
就可以避开侧方的小脑幕
we can cross the tentorium on the contralateral side

602
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,920
避开所有血管
and avoid all those blood vessels.

603
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:46,430
我们可以通过你的鼻腔进行活检
We can do a biopsy through your nose.

604
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:56,350
你也不会死
You can't die, too.

605
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,550
我得去吐了
I have to throw up.

606
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:14,690
所以我们要怎么做  上报吗
So how do we do this? Do we file a report?

607
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:15,920
私下跟安德鲁斯交流下吗
Talk to Andrews personally?

608
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,360
你要上报肖恩吗
You want to report Shaun?

609
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:20,230
我不想  但我们必须如此
I don't want to. I think we have to.

610
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:21,390
不  你很想这样
No, you want to.

611
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:23,850
而我们也必须这样  如果我们目标
And we'd certainly have to if our sole agenda

612
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,050
是弄走肖恩
would be to take down Shaun

613
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:26,990
让你少一个竞争对手
and to give you one less person to compete against.

614
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:28,730
当然  我们还是得「必须」
And certainly, we'd absolutely "Have to"

615
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:31,890
掩盖一个可能的致命手术错误
cover up and bury a possible fatal medical error

616
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:34,160
如果我们的终极目的是保护一个朋友
if our sole agenda was to protect a friend?

617
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,450
医院规定肯定会站在那个婊子一侧
Protocol would seem to favor the bitch over the friend.

618
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:38,680
谢谢
Thanks?

619
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,380
我刚刚吐了
I threw up.

620
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,480
我们需要报告失误
We have a duty to report errors

621
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,010
这样他们才不会再发生
so they won't happen again.

622
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,160
这样才会拯救生命
The process saves lives.

623
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,680
我们到底在避免重复什么错误
And exactly what errors are we trying to avoid a repeat of?

624
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:55,400
你担心下次还会有自闭的外科医生
You worried about the next time an autistic surgeon operates

625
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:57,250
在发现自己的良师益友要死于脑癌后
on a drugged-up frat kid after finding out his mentor

626
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:58,770
再给一个嗑药的孩子做手术吗
is dying of brain cancer?

627
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,800
梅伦德斯医生告诉我们了  肖恩
Dr. Melendez told us, Shaun.

628
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:05,220
我们很抱歉
We're really sorry.

629
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:07,230
没关系
It's okay.

630
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:09,720
没关系
It's okay.

631
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,260
他会没事的
I think he's going to be okay.

632
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:14,170
医院规定之所以存在
The protocol exists

633
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:16,000
是为了让我们不会问这种问题
so that we don't ask questions like that.

634
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,760
听上去不是个好主意
That seems like a bad idea.

635
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:19,270
你相信你自己的评价
You trust your judgment.

636
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:20,730
你相信摩根的评价吗
Do you trust Morgan's judgment?

637
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:23,050
你相信这所医院里所有医生的评价吗
Do you trust the judgment of all the doctors in this building?

638
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:25,150
你可以评价  他们也可以
If you can make judgment calls, so can they.

639
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:26,690
这就是为什么我们需要规定
That's why we need these rules.

640
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:29,790
医院规定对这所医院里所有人都可以
No, the protocol is fine for everyone in this building,

641
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:31,090
除了肖恩
except for Shaun.

642
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:34,160
他们会训斥我们任何人但他们会解雇肖恩
They'd reprimand any one of us, but they will fire him.

643
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:35,710
好的
Okay.

644
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,530
我们上报吧
We report it.

645
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:39,560
我们做了调查
We get the investigation,

646
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,490
确保这种事情不会再发生
make sure nothing like this ever happens again.

647
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:44,470
但我们告诉他们是我做的
But we tell them I did it.

648
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:47,880
他们也会解雇你
They'd fire you, too.

649
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,730
这不是什么坏事
It's not a terrible idea.

650
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:52,070
杰瑞德怎么都会出局的
Jared's out the door either way.

651
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:53,870
我们可以重新用药物治疗吗
Can we get back to the medicine?

652
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:55,440
卡登还活着
Caden is still alive.

653
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,690
如果我们可以保持他活着
If we can keep it that way,

654
00:33:56,690 --> 00:33:58,280
就不会有任何流言蜚语
there won't be any review.

655
00:33:58,290 --> 00:33:59,960
没有人会问问题
Which means no one will be asking questions,

656
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,400
没有人需要给出答案
and no one will have to give answers.

657
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:02,640
所有都会消失
It all goes away.

658
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,900
卡登如果死了我们就说实话
If Caden dies, we tell the truth

659
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:07,170
我们一起面对结果
and we face the consequences together.

660
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:09,250
不
No.

661
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:11,700
不
No.

662
00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:16,570
我以为我找到了我的玩具手术刀
I thought I'd found my toy scalpel.

663
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:21,720
我们需要你回到团队中来  莫菲
We need you to come back to the group, Murphy.

664
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,230
给假动脉瘤的成像给我
Get me imaging on that pseudo-aneurysm.

665
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,880
怎么了
What's up?

666
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:43,000
你对莫菲医生的看法
Do you still feel - the same way about Dr. Murphy

667
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:44,040
是不是跟他刚来的时候还是一样的
as when he got here?

668
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:50,820
格拉斯曼医生给了我们一定的担保
Dr. Glassman gave us certain...assurances.

669
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:55,290
如果肖恩表现得不是非常出色
"If Shaun proves - anything less than excellent,

670
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:57,450
如果他没有展示出我认为他能达到的水平
if Shaun doesn't live up to everything I know he can do,

671
00:34:57,450 --> 00:34:58,770
他会立刻被辞退
he will be immediately released,

672
00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:02,660
而我也会辞去医院院长的职务
and I will resign my position as president of the hospital."

673
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:04,300
而你也写下来了
And you wrote it down.

674
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,080
我确保了这句话会在会议备忘中
I made sure it was in the minutes.

675
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,030
肖恩超出了我的预期
Shaun has exceeded my expectations.

676
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,860
也超出了我的  然后呢
Mine, as well, and?

677
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:15,230
我对格拉斯曼医生的看法也没有变化
And my feelings about Dr. Glassman have not changed.

678
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,380
谢谢你
Thank you.

679
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:24,990
我们需要给他做手术
We need to cut him open.

680
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:26,500
我们一旦给他手术  他就会死
We cut him open and he dies.

681
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:29,180
在我们看到动脉之前他就会大出血死亡
He'll bleed out before we can even get the artery exposed.

682
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:32,140
如果我们不动手术  他会死
If we don't cut him open, he dies.

683
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:36,540
别动他
Don't cut him open.

684
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:37,540
莫菲  如果我们不
Murphy, if we don't --

685
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:40,980
我们应该从他的大腿里装一条
We should insert an endovascular graft

686
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:43,010
血管内移植血管
through his leg instead.

687
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:45,420
从内部解决问题
Fix it from the inside out.

688
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:47,600
我在腹主动脉大扩张做过
I've done that for large abdominal aorta dilations,

689
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,430
但这是一台漫长的假动脉瘤切除
but this is a lengthy dissecting pseudo-aneurysm.

690
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:51,550
这样会更安全
It's safer.

691
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:53,110
动脉壁已经受影响了
The aortic wall is already compromised.

692
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:54,450
可能会完全破裂
Could rupture completely.

693
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:57,390
凯登会在移植血管内的气囊放气的瞬间死亡
Caden could die as soon as we deflate the balloon inside the graft.

694
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:58,920
但什么都不做会要了他的命
But doing nothing will kill him.

695
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,110
也不尽然
Not definitely.

696
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:02,700
凯登也有机会能够
There's still a chance Caden will simply come out of this

697
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,120
不用动手术也能活下来
without any surgical intervention.

698
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,170
5%  或者10%的几率
5%, 10% maybe.

699
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:06,980
不是毫无机会
Not nothing.

700
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,090
我们是在知道肖恩闯祸之后
And we're doubling down on Shaun

701
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:09,800
还要踩上一脚
after we know he caused this problem.

702
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,500
这在发病和死亡病例研讨会上能有什么效果
How's that gonna look at an M&M?

703
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,160
我相信肖恩的想法
I trust Shaun's idea.

704
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,500
他会犯别人不会犯的错误
He makes mistakes no one else would make,

705
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:21,280
但他有我们从来没想过的救治方法
but he also makes saves none of us would have ever thought of.

706
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:23,000
谢谢
Thank you.

707
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:24,030
不客气
You're welcome.

708
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:26,310
我还是觉得你不应该在这里工作
I still don't think you should be working here.

709
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:28,160
我觉得代价还是太高
I don't think the trade-off is worth it.

710
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:31,680
我给他准备手术
Well, let's prep him for surgery.

711
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:38,930
抽出导线  雷兹尼克
Pull the guide wire, Reznick.

712
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,800
推入移植血管
I'm passing in the graft.

713
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:51,110
你现在就在假动脉瘤的上方
You're right over the pseudo-aneurysm now.

714
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:05,660
给气囊充气  释放移植血管
Inflating the balloon to deploy the graft.

715
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,050
放气
Deflating.

716
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:17,400
我能做吗
Can I do it?

717
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,490
太易损了
It's delicate.

718
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:22,440
并没有
No, it's not.

719
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:27,550
要么成功要么失败
And it will either work or it won't work.

720
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,930
如果我的想法错了
If my idea is wrong,

721
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:34,660
他就会在我们完成下一步的时候立刻死亡
he'll die as soon - as we complete this next step.

722
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:39,090
你不应该背负着这种责任
You shouldn't have to live with that.

723
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:47,180
在这个手术室里发生的一切都是我的责任
Everything that happens in this room is my responsibility.

724
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:52,010
那我们一起来
We'll do it together.

725
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:04,990
放气
Deflating.

726
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:33,320
大家都不要回家
Nobody's going home.

727
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:39,280
我为这个团队以及我们今天所做的感到骄傲
I am proud of this team and what we accomplished today.

728
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,680
我请大家在哈利·霍普喝东西
Drinks are on me at Harry Hopes.

729
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:45,150
我们要庆祝吗
We're celebrating?

730
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:47,910
今天是场灾难  我们走运而已
Today was a disaster, and we got lucky.

731
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:50,310
你是对的
You're right.

732
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:53,950
但你走运的时候  你就应该庆祝
But when you get lucky, you celebrate.

733
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,360
走吧
Let's go.

734
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,870
在你的职业生涯的某一刻
At some point in your career,

735
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:13,480
病人会死在你手上的
you're going to kill someone.

736
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,510
我希望在事情发生的时候
And I hope for your sake there's a doctor out there

737
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:19,280
会有一名医生相信你
who still believes in you when you do.

738
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:36,790
一直都在这里
It was there all along.

739
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:40,560
我要去喝酒了  但是我想让你知道
I have to go drinking, but I wanted you to know --

740
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:45,090
是静脉注射的伤口吗
Is that from an IV?

741
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,420
你做了活检
You did the biopsy.

742
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:51,340
对
I did.

743
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:55,390
我有一个小型的神经胶质瘤
I have a low-grade glioma.

744
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:57,320
不是脑干胶质瘤吗
Not a GBM?

745
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:59,150
我告诉过你了
I told you --

746
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:01,100
癌症  肖恩  还是癌症
Cancer, Shaun. It's still cancer.

747
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:03,750
我得接受开颅手术
I have to undergo brain surgery,

748
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:06,590
因为不是我自己做  所以很可怕
which is really scary because I'm not the one performing it.

749
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:09,220
每周五次  为期六周的放疗
Five days a week - for six weeks of radiation,

750
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:11,920
还有十周的化疗
10 more weeks of chemotherapy.

751
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,500
然后呢
And then?

752
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:18,130
然后
And then...

753
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:20,490
如果能有点运气
with a little luck...

754
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:24,280
我们下一赛季就能去看超级碗了
you and I can go to the Super Bowl next season.

755
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:39,150
你不会死的
You're going to live.

756
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,380
还有希望
There's hope.

757
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:48,500
去吧  去跟你的朋友们玩吧
Now go. Go have some fun with your friends.

758
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:52,760
好的  首先我要告诉安德鲁斯我犯的错误
Yes. First I have to tell Dr. Andrews about the mistake I made.

759
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,140
肖恩  不可以
Shaun, y-you can't.

760
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:58,880
方案很清楚  报告能救命
Protocol is clear, and reporting saves lives.

761
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,510
我听说凯登在恢复中
And I hear Caden is on the road to recovery,

762
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:03,630
所以你的错误并不会太大
so your mistake couldn't have been too bad.

763
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:05,030
不  我犯了错
No, I made a mistake.

764
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:06,590
肖恩  我明白
Shaun, I understand that.

765
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:08,680
但是安德鲁斯医生会利用这件事情
But Dr. Andrews will use this.

766
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,110
你还记得格拉斯曼医生在你被雇佣时
And do you remember the commitment

767
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:12,340
做出的承诺吗
that Dr. Glassman made when you were hired?

768
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:14,810
我保证你会很出色的对吧  肖恩
I promised you'd be excellent, right, Shaun?

769
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:16,770
你的表现很好
And you have been excellent.

770
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:21,260
你不能给安德鲁斯医生这个借口
You can't give Dr. Andrews this excuse.

771
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:24,720
我没有很好
I was not excellent.

772
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,140
这一次  我表现不好
This time, I was bad.

773
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:32,240
但外科医生每一次都要表现出众
And surgeons have to be excellent every time.

774
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:33,480
对吧  肖恩
Right, Shaun?

775
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,310
你同意他这么做吗
You agree with him?

776
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:39,480
我不想让他为了保住我的工作而撒谎
I'm not gonna ask him to lie to save my job.

777
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:42,620
别这么做
Don't do this.

778
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:46,750
这是肖恩的决定
It's up to Shaun.

779
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:48,990
我相信你的判断
I trust your judgment.

780
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:57,490
我这么做不是要伤害你
I'm not doing this to hurt you.

781
00:41:58,070 --> 00:41:58,970
我知道
I know.

782
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,320
我们是朋友
We are friends.

783
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:02,700
对
Yes, we are.

784
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,140
我爱你
I love you.

785
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:07,810
我知道  我也爱你
I know. I love you, too.

786
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:12,490
我更爱你
I love you more.
