1
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,695
I want to be your friend again.

2
00:00:13,711 --> 00:00:16,052
W-Why, Shaun? What happened?

3
00:00:16,052 --> 00:00:18,219
People need friends.

4
00:00:18,221 --> 00:00:20,621
Well...

5
00:00:20,623 --> 00:00:22,523
Yeah, they do.

6
00:00:22,525 --> 00:00:23,958
But you said

7
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,753
you wanted me
to stop interfering, remember?

8
00:00:26,755 --> 00:00:28,963
You wanted space.

9
00:00:28,965 --> 00:00:31,666
You wanted to make your own mistakes.

10
00:00:31,668 --> 00:00:35,803
I need a friend more than I need space.

11
00:00:38,975 --> 00:00:42,143
You were a good mentor and a good friend.

12
00:00:42,145 --> 00:00:44,746
Well, thank you, Shaun.

13
00:00:46,149 --> 00:00:48,683
You don't know how much it means to me

14
00:00:48,685 --> 00:00:50,018
to hear you say that.

15
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,420
But I-I think...

16
00:00:55,441 --> 00:00:58,659
...I think you may need a new mentor.

17
00:01:01,164 --> 00:01:03,231
I'm dying.

12 to 18 months.

20
00:01:18,948 --> 00:01:22,450
I'd appreciate it
if you didn't tell anyone, okay?

21
00:01:22,452 --> 00:01:23,951
I-I will in my own time.

22
00:01:23,953 --> 00:01:24,952
Okay.

23
00:01:24,954 --> 00:01:26,601
Have you had a full work-up?

24
00:01:26,603 --> 00:01:27,841
Yes, of course.

25
00:01:27,843 --> 00:01:30,291
It could be a secondary tumor

26
00:01:30,293 --> 00:01:32,627
metastasized to your brain
from somewhere else.

27
00:01:32,629 --> 00:01:33,817
It's the only tumor found.

28
00:01:33,819 --> 00:01:36,809
It could be an inflammatory
or infectious process.

29
00:01:36,809 --> 00:01:38,375
It was a tumor, Shaun.

30
00:01:38,377 --> 00:01:40,177
You should get a second opinion.

31
00:01:40,179 --> 00:01:41,878
Shaun, I've been a neurosurgeon
for 30 years.

32
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,948
I think that qualifies
as a second opinion.

33
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:48,785
You should get a second opinion.

34
00:01:48,787 --> 00:01:50,020
You have to know whether...

35
00:01:50,022 --> 00:01:51,388
All right, all right,
all right, all right, Shaun.

36
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:52,889
I'll get a second opinion.

37
00:01:52,891 --> 00:01:54,024
Okay?

38
00:01:54,026 --> 00:01:55,258
Okay.

39
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,796
Can I go to work now?

40
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,667
Okay, Doctor, what's your diagnosis?

41
00:02:03,669 --> 00:02:04,835
I'm drunk.

42
00:02:04,837 --> 00:02:07,304
Not you. Other doctor.

43
00:02:08,674 --> 00:02:11,007
Uh, well, given
the degree of the rotation

44
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:13,043
and the fact that
the break is almost compound,

45
00:02:13,045 --> 00:02:14,845
I'd say we're dealing with a Bimalleolar

46
00:02:14,847 --> 00:02:16,079
or Trimalleolar fracture.

47
00:02:16,081 --> 00:02:18,081
Very good. What else?

48
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:20,050
Um...

49
00:02:21,252 --> 00:02:22,319
Color?

50
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,654
Blood flow is restricted.

51
00:02:24,656 --> 00:02:26,156
His foot's dying.

52
00:02:26,158 --> 00:02:28,325
- Oh, no.
- Mm.

53
00:02:28,327 --> 00:02:30,753
I'm gonna have to reset it now.
Hold his leg.

54
00:02:31,274 --> 00:02:33,027
- No.
- No, it's Ok.

55
00:02:33,068 --> 00:02:35,068
It just going to take a second
I need you to count to three.

56
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,533
One...

57
00:02:36,535 --> 00:02:38,201
- One,
- two...

58
00:02:38,203 --> 00:02:40,103
Aah!

59
00:02:43,008 --> 00:02:45,876
Is Caden's leg gonna be okay?

60
00:02:45,878 --> 00:02:47,878
How long has his leg been like this

61
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,546
and how exactly did it happen?

62
00:02:49,548 --> 00:02:51,982
Well, he's been like that
since I found him.

63
00:02:51,984 --> 00:02:54,384
He probably tripped over
a curb or something

64
00:02:54,386 --> 00:02:56,553
because that's where he was.

65
00:02:56,555 --> 00:02:58,555
Any reason you felt the need
to tell me twice

66
00:02:58,557 --> 00:02:59,990
that you found him like this?

67
00:02:59,992 --> 00:03:02,916
Dr. Park, boy's going to surgery.
You're going with.

68
00:03:03,629 --> 00:03:05,548
Don't go anywhere.

69
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,074
AmericasCardroom.com brings poker back
Million Dollar Sunday Tournament every Sunday

70
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,341
Shouldn't I be asleep for this?

71
00:03:18,343 --> 00:03:21,511
Your blood alcohol level
complicates anesthesia

72
00:03:21,513 --> 00:03:23,513
and we think you have a concussion,

73
00:03:23,515 --> 00:03:25,515
so we're gonna keep you responsive.

74
00:03:25,517 --> 00:03:27,350
We did give you a regional nerve block,

75
00:03:27,352 --> 00:03:29,386
so you shouldn't feel anything.

76
00:03:31,689 --> 00:03:33,957
Huh. Cool.

77
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:36,359
Bend the ICP plate over
two degrees on the proximal end.

78
00:03:36,361 --> 00:03:37,827
Contouring pliers.

79
00:03:44,403 --> 00:03:46,102
BP is dropping, heart rate's rising.

80
00:03:46,104 --> 00:03:48,805
- Let's tube him.
- IV fluids and phenylephrine, stat.

81
00:03:48,807 --> 00:03:51,708
We need to abort until we can get a
handle on what else is going on.

82
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,977
Give me a full body CT,
full blood panels, and an echo.

83
00:03:53,979 --> 00:03:56,479
I think Jared and I may be able
to dig up an answer quicker.

84
00:03:56,481 --> 00:03:57,781
Great. Get on it.

85
00:05:01,645 --> 00:05:03,595
Come up with anything?

86
00:05:04,316 --> 00:05:06,415
Neither did I.

87
00:05:07,152 --> 00:05:10,820
I had a friend,
a neurosurgeon, at SF Muni.

88
00:05:10,822 --> 00:05:12,655
She looked at the scans.

89
00:05:12,657 --> 00:05:15,658
She came to the same diagnosis, Shaun.

90
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,328
I have an inoperable glioma.

91
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:20,350
Okay?

92
00:05:31,342 --> 00:05:33,543
I think you should go back to work, yes?

93
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:40,550
I need to go to work.

94
00:05:47,224 --> 00:05:48,491
Be reasonable.

95
00:05:48,493 --> 00:05:49,859
Beg your pardon?

96
00:05:49,861 --> 00:05:51,361
Be reasonable.

97
00:05:51,363 --> 00:05:52,862
I have no idea what you're talking about.

98
00:05:52,864 --> 00:05:54,030
Oh, it'll be clear.

99
00:05:54,032 --> 00:05:55,532
What the hell happened to Caden?

100
00:05:55,534 --> 00:05:57,200
- I... I don't know.
- He twisted his ankle. I...

101
00:05:57,202 --> 00:05:58,368
You lied to me before.

102
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:00,036
You're lying to me now,
you spoiled little coward.

103
00:06:00,038 --> 00:06:02,372
Hey, hey. Be reasonable.

104
00:06:02,374 --> 00:06:03,973
His friend's hurt.

105
00:06:03,975 --> 00:06:06,057
He's scared, and you're freaking him out.

106
00:06:16,655 --> 00:06:19,022
He's angry, but he's not wrong.

107
00:06:19,024 --> 00:06:22,325
Caden's in bad shape,
and we don't know why.

108
00:06:22,327 --> 00:06:24,561
We need to know what happened.

109
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:28,665
No, no, don't... don't worry about him.

110
00:06:28,667 --> 00:06:30,166
Talk to me.

111
00:06:30,168 --> 00:06:32,168
You tell me the truth.

112
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:35,538
You won't get in trouble.
You'll just... help a friend.

113
00:06:36,674 --> 00:06:38,508
All right.

114
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:40,510
We were pledging.

115
00:06:40,512 --> 00:06:43,346
And there's... there's this,
uh, wheel of torture thing

116
00:06:43,348 --> 00:06:45,148
you got to do for initiation.

117
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,382
Torture?

118
00:06:46,384 --> 00:06:48,351
- But it's mos...
- it's mostly stupid stuff, dude.

119
00:06:48,353 --> 00:06:50,854
It's, like, like,
drink a cup of olive oil

120
00:06:50,856 --> 00:06:53,323
or eat a tablespoon of cinnamon.

121
00:06:53,325 --> 00:06:54,791
And what did Caden land on?

122
00:06:54,793 --> 00:06:56,025
Laundry.

123
00:06:56,027 --> 00:06:57,215
He had to do laundry?

124
00:06:57,217 --> 00:07:01,798
No, like, like, he had to,
uh, eat th-those laundry things,

125
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,167
as many as he could in 30 seconds.

126
00:07:04,169 --> 00:07:05,969
Detergent? Eat detergent?

127
00:07:05,971 --> 00:07:07,770
And how many did he have?

128
00:07:07,772 --> 00:07:10,540
- I don't know.
- Like six, maybe seven, seven.

129
00:07:11,543 --> 00:07:12,950
He ate detergent.

130
00:07:12,952 --> 00:07:14,978
Could've burned a hole
through his esophagus

131
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,113
or his stomach and intestines.

132
00:07:22,157 --> 00:07:23,323
Catch that bleeder, please.

133
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,859
Let's hope he doesn't breed.

134
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:29,162
What? He <i>isn't</i> an idiot?

135
00:07:29,164 --> 00:07:31,131
We have healthy bowel
attached to healthy bowel.

136
00:07:31,133 --> 00:07:32,799
Let's close him up.

137
00:07:32,801 --> 00:07:34,167
Dr. Melendez?

138
00:07:34,169 --> 00:07:36,002
The trauma S.O.D. is asking
for you in O.R. number 2.

139
00:07:36,004 --> 00:07:37,637
We got an emergency thoracotomy.

140
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:39,606
Who can give me
the remaining steps for closing?

141
00:07:39,608 --> 00:07:41,975
Cut anchoring sutures, clear
laps, and reposition the bowel.

142
00:07:41,977 --> 00:07:43,810
Remove clamps from
the duodenal resection site,

143
00:07:43,812 --> 00:07:45,345
keeping clear of the underlying aorta,

144
00:07:45,347 --> 00:07:47,214
close the fascia
using a looped O monofilament,

145
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:49,577
close the dermal layer,
then re-approximate the skin.

146
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:54,654
Also, you need to ensure
no omentum is caught

147
00:07:54,656 --> 00:07:56,390
in the fascial suture line.

148
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,658
Close him up.

149
00:07:59,129 --> 00:08:00,861
Murphy, you're lead.

150
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,166
Clearing laps.

151
00:08:08,704 --> 00:08:11,605
I will hold the repaired segment in place

152
00:08:11,607 --> 00:08:15,142
while you run the bowel for me.

153
00:08:20,549 --> 00:08:23,850
Bowel is clear
and ready to be repositioned.

154
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:29,389
Shaun?

155
00:08:31,193 --> 00:08:32,888
Shaun, is everything all right?

156
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,530
I lost something.

157
00:08:36,532 --> 00:08:37,664
In the cavity?

158
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:39,065
No.

159
00:08:39,067 --> 00:08:41,368
But I know where it is now.

160
00:08:53,281 --> 00:08:54,981
Shaun.

161
00:08:54,983 --> 00:08:58,485
I left my scalpel here earlier today.

162
00:08:58,487 --> 00:09:01,922
You should get Diffusion Tensor Imaging.

163
00:09:01,924 --> 00:09:03,757
A DTI?

164
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:09,463
Masses are difficult
to diagnose accurately.

165
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,469
You should get more imaging.

166
00:09:17,165 --> 00:09:18,438
People make mistakes.

167
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,273
That's not gonna happen, Shaun.

168
00:09:23,277 --> 00:09:25,840
My scalpel isn't here.

169
00:09:36,641 --> 00:09:38,019
What happened this time?

170
00:09:38,021 --> 00:09:39,259
He's got a bleed somewhere.

171
00:09:39,261 --> 00:09:40,961
I want a capsule endoscopy to check

172
00:09:40,963 --> 00:09:42,796
the entire length of the bowel
for bleeding and leaks.

173
00:09:42,798 --> 00:09:44,130
And get me a complete coagulation

174
00:09:44,132 --> 00:09:46,600
- and metabolic profile.
- On it.

175
00:09:54,308 --> 00:09:56,510
Dr. Glassman is dying.

176
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:58,178
What?

177
00:09:59,814 --> 00:10:02,015
What do you mean? He seemed fine.

178
00:10:02,017 --> 00:10:05,986
They say he has a glioma.

179
00:10:05,988 --> 00:10:08,154
That's a brain tumor.

180
00:10:08,156 --> 00:10:12,325
And he won't do a DTI scan
to confirm the diagnosis.

181
00:10:12,327 --> 00:10:13,760
Did he get a second opinion?

182
00:10:13,762 --> 00:10:18,832
He has, but delayed or missed
or incorrect diagnosis

183
00:10:18,834 --> 00:10:21,801
has an occurrence rate of 10% to 20%.

184
00:10:21,803 --> 00:10:23,603
Doctors make mistakes.

185
00:10:23,605 --> 00:10:25,247
Shaun, I don't know
what you want me to do.

186
00:10:25,272 --> 00:10:28,065
I-I want you to sit down.

187
00:10:29,612 --> 00:10:31,314
That's what people say

188
00:10:31,316 --> 00:10:35,415
when they want to tell you
something important.

189
00:10:37,941 --> 00:10:39,534
The part about him dying,

190
00:10:39,536 --> 00:10:41,288
that wasn't the important part?

191
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:51,231
He won't listen to me.

192
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:52,699
He is stubborn.

193
00:10:52,701 --> 00:10:54,200
- That he is.
- Stubborn.

194
00:10:54,202 --> 00:10:56,014
He <i>will</i> listen to you.

195
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:59,706
Okay, you have known him longer,

196
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:02,642
you're his friend, he trusts you.

197
00:11:02,644 --> 00:11:04,477
Shaun, I can't make him
do anything, either.

198
00:11:04,479 --> 00:11:06,980
You... Y-You're an attorney.

199
00:11:06,982 --> 00:11:10,317
I'm not skilled at lying or manipulation.

200
00:11:11,987 --> 00:11:14,032
So you want me to what?

201
00:11:15,657 --> 00:11:17,785
You want me to manipulate him?

202
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:20,994
You want me to use our relationship

203
00:11:20,996 --> 00:11:25,165
and our history
to trick him into doing this?

204
00:11:27,169 --> 00:11:29,336
Yes, please.

205
00:11:35,344 --> 00:11:38,211
I knew you wouldn't let him die.

206
00:11:40,215 --> 00:11:43,783
Our patient has Disseminated
Intravascular Coagulation.

207
00:11:43,785 --> 00:11:45,719
Can anyone tell me why that is very bad?

208
00:11:45,721 --> 00:11:47,854
Blood clots form
throughout the blood vessels

209
00:11:47,856 --> 00:11:49,956
and rapidly deplete
the body's clotting factors,

210
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:51,558
thereby causing a systematic bleed.

211
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,026
It's also a catch-22.

212
00:11:53,028 --> 00:11:54,527
If we treat the clotting,

213
00:11:54,529 --> 00:11:56,396
he might end up with a terminal bleed.

214
00:11:56,398 --> 00:11:58,632
And if we treat the bleeding,
he'll have a terminal clot.

215
00:11:58,634 --> 00:11:59,699
So how do we treat it?

216
00:11:59,701 --> 00:12:01,267
We figure out the cause. Treat the cause.

217
00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:03,036
More damage from the detergent?

218
00:12:03,038 --> 00:12:04,471
Margins were clear. It's not that.

219
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:06,239
He could have a crush injury
from his ankle.

220
00:12:06,241 --> 00:12:08,847
Or a bacterial infection he picked
up before or during surgery.

221
00:12:08,849 --> 00:12:10,710
It might have been set off by drug use.

222
00:12:10,712 --> 00:12:12,215
Or we did this to him.

223
00:12:14,926 --> 00:12:16,816
And by "we," I mean Shaun.

224
00:12:17,512 --> 00:12:19,953
He spaced out in the O.R.
when he was closing,

225
00:12:19,955 --> 00:12:21,454
kind of like he is now.

226
00:12:21,456 --> 00:12:23,590
- I'm listening.
- Comforting.

227
00:12:23,592 --> 00:12:24,791
He wasn't focused.

228
00:12:24,793 --> 00:12:26,292
He could've nicked a vessel,
which could've caused...

229
00:12:26,294 --> 00:12:27,594
Okay, we're talking about Shaun.

230
00:12:27,596 --> 00:12:31,331
Yeah, he's quiet, but he was focused.

231
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,499
He's always focused.

232
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:33,833
His stitches look like

233
00:12:33,835 --> 00:12:35,602
they came out of a sewing machine.

234
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:38,338
All right. Complications happen.

235
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,607
The kid was in pretty bad shape
when we got him.

236
00:12:40,609 --> 00:12:43,610
Physician error is way down
on the list of likely causes.

237
00:12:43,612 --> 00:12:45,111
Crush trauma being top.

238
00:12:45,113 --> 00:12:48,710
Get him started on fresh frozen
plasma and crystalloid fluids.

239
00:12:55,257 --> 00:12:56,790
Yeah?

240
00:12:56,792 --> 00:12:58,692
You got a second?

241
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:01,294
Well, that's an open question.

242
00:13:01,296 --> 00:13:03,596
What can I do for you?

243
00:13:03,598 --> 00:13:06,132
I got a patient with DIC.

244
00:13:06,134 --> 00:13:08,835
One of the possible causes
is surgeon error.

245
00:13:08,837 --> 00:13:10,470
Your patient, your error?

246
00:13:10,472 --> 00:13:12,138
Shaun's.

247
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:15,475
He got distracted
during surgery, spaced out.

248
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:17,477
It's not like him.

249
00:13:17,479 --> 00:13:19,949
One place he never misses a beat
is the O.R.

250
00:13:21,284 --> 00:13:23,450
Is there anything going on
that I should know about?

251
00:13:27,081 --> 00:13:28,722
He got some bad news.

252
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:29,823
About what?

253
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:32,459
It's a personal matter.

254
00:13:32,461 --> 00:13:37,197
Shaun was distracted by a personal issue?

255
00:13:38,342 --> 00:13:39,866
What, did Lea come back?

256
00:13:41,535 --> 00:13:43,403
She have a new boyfriend?

257
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:45,138
His cable get cut off?

258
00:13:46,309 --> 00:13:48,708
I have an inoperable glioma.

259
00:13:50,188 --> 00:13:52,011
18 months.

260
00:13:57,686 --> 00:13:59,819
Aaron, I am so sorry.

261
00:14:00,698 --> 00:14:02,255
Me, too.

262
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:06,192
Is there anything I can do?

263
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:08,661
I wish.

264
00:14:11,633 --> 00:14:13,105
You should've told me.

265
00:14:16,271 --> 00:14:18,243
Or at least you shouldn't have told him.

266
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:37,383
His coagulation factors are still off.

267
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:38,462
Crush trauma isn't the issue.

268
00:14:38,464 --> 00:14:40,029
And his tox screen came back clean.

269
00:14:40,031 --> 00:14:42,312
- It's not drugs, either.
- We don't know that.

270
00:14:42,337 --> 00:14:43,803
He's had so many transfusions,

271
00:14:43,805 --> 00:14:45,972
the blood in his veins isn't
the same blood he came in with.

272
00:14:45,974 --> 00:14:47,773
The drugs could still be
in his organs causing...

273
00:14:47,775 --> 00:14:48,975
I get that you don't want to think

274
00:14:48,977 --> 00:14:50,610
that this could be caused by your friend,

275
00:14:50,612 --> 00:14:52,845
but we have to... The kid came
directly from a frat hazing, hammered.

276
00:14:52,847 --> 00:14:54,814
What are the odds he <i>wasn't</i> on drugs?

277
00:14:54,816 --> 00:14:56,382
We should start IV midazolam

278
00:14:56,384 --> 00:14:57,984
and sodium bicarbonate to counteract...

279
00:14:57,986 --> 00:15:00,353
- That's the treatment for amphetamines.
- If you're wrong,

280
00:15:00,355 --> 00:15:01,854
that could cause a fatal arrhythmia.

281
00:15:01,856 --> 00:15:04,290
I'll find out what drugs he's on.

282
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:09,996
You're going to find out by asking?

283
00:15:09,998 --> 00:15:11,497
Blake was honest with me before.

284
00:15:11,499 --> 00:15:12,832
It's a lot easier to be honest

285
00:15:12,834 --> 00:15:14,300
when you're not confessing to a crime.

286
00:15:14,302 --> 00:15:16,202
We don't have a lot of choice
in the matter.

287
00:15:17,705 --> 00:15:19,839
That's not true.

288
00:15:22,155 --> 00:15:23,776
Thanks for doing this.

289
00:15:24,532 --> 00:15:25,845
Yeah, no worries.

290
00:15:27,273 --> 00:15:29,181
Noticed it was cut when I first saw you.

291
00:15:29,183 --> 00:15:31,217
Figured it should get cleaned up.

292
00:15:33,249 --> 00:15:34,966
Is it all right if I draw some blood?

293
00:15:34,991 --> 00:15:36,149
Just want to make sure

294
00:15:36,151 --> 00:15:37,643
you don't have any toxins or infections.

295
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:38,921
Sure.

296
00:15:41,429 --> 00:15:47,033
So, uh, the nurse said
that Caden has DIC.

297
00:15:47,737 --> 00:15:49,237
Do you know what that is?

298
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:50,405
Mnh-mnh.

299
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:52,274
Well, in short, his body is clotting

300
00:15:52,276 --> 00:15:53,809
and hemorrhaging at the same time.

301
00:15:53,811 --> 00:15:55,610
If we can't figure out what's causing it,

302
00:15:55,612 --> 00:15:57,023
he'll die.

303
00:16:02,278 --> 00:16:04,405
Just hold that there for me.

304
00:16:05,389 --> 00:16:06,824
All done.

305
00:16:09,243 --> 00:16:11,059
Blake, buddy, you're on something.

306
00:16:11,061 --> 00:16:12,427
Your pupils are dilated,

307
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:14,296
and you're sweating in a 68-degree room.

308
00:16:14,298 --> 00:16:16,064
Now, I can hand this over to the cops

309
00:16:16,066 --> 00:16:18,733
or you can tell the truth
about what Caden's on.

310
00:16:20,659 --> 00:16:21,837
Molly.

311
00:16:24,975 --> 00:16:27,409
I would've told you the truth
if you'd asked.

312
00:16:29,343 --> 00:16:30,912
I'm sorry.

313
00:16:32,415 --> 00:16:34,416
You have time to talk?

314
00:16:36,854 --> 00:16:38,086
Shaun told you.

315
00:16:38,088 --> 00:16:39,621
He did. Yeah.

316
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:41,670
I wish I would've heard it from you.

317
00:16:41,672 --> 00:16:43,525
Yeah, I'm sorry.

318
00:16:43,527 --> 00:16:45,360
- We're friends.
- I get it.

319
00:16:45,362 --> 00:16:47,429
- I want to be there for you.
- What, are you mad at me?

320
00:16:47,431 --> 00:16:49,097
Yes.

321
00:16:49,099 --> 00:16:51,199
I'm supposed to be there for you.

322
00:16:51,201 --> 00:16:53,368
To do what? To do what exactly?
Hold my hand?

323
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:54,870
Yes, if that's what's needed.

324
00:16:54,872 --> 00:16:57,239
Okay, well, what I need
is to be left alone, okay?

325
00:16:57,241 --> 00:16:58,440
Well, you told Shaun,

326
00:16:58,442 --> 00:17:00,709
so that was a brilliant strategy.

327
00:17:00,711 --> 00:17:02,077
Okay, okay, I get it.

328
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,212
Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, okay?

329
00:17:04,214 --> 00:17:06,381
Sometimes when people
are told they are dying,

330
00:17:06,383 --> 00:17:07,549
they do stupid things!

331
00:17:07,551 --> 00:17:10,385
Sometimes people around them
do stupid things!

332
00:17:10,387 --> 00:17:12,053
Shaun told you to come here

333
00:17:12,055 --> 00:17:15,857
to try to convince me
to get more imaging, right?!

334
00:17:16,893 --> 00:17:18,604
Aaron, you can't stop fighting.

335
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:26,234
- Maddie wouldn't have wanted you to stop
- ...Don't, don't, don't, don't you dare.

336
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:28,336
Don't you dare.

337
00:17:31,117 --> 00:17:33,742
What are you gonna say, huh?

338
00:17:33,744 --> 00:17:35,977
That Maddie was a fighter?

339
00:17:37,206 --> 00:17:38,413
Huh?

340
00:17:38,415 --> 00:17:40,001
That she never quit?

341
00:17:48,257 --> 00:17:49,501
I'm sorry.

342
00:17:53,497 --> 00:17:55,164
Thank you.

343
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:01,569
And you should get the DTI.

344
00:18:03,573 --> 00:18:05,573
Not for you.

345
00:18:05,575 --> 00:18:09,377
You've accepted your diagnosis.

346
00:18:09,864 --> 00:18:11,446
Shaun hasn't.

347
00:18:14,451 --> 00:18:17,085
He needs to.

348
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:22,924
Hey, Neil.

349
00:18:22,926 --> 00:18:25,560
I heard there was a complication
in one of your cases.

350
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:26,895
Caden Hauley?

351
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:28,730
Heard or have you been monitoring

352
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:30,065
all of Murphy's cases?

353
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:32,067
I monitor all my department's cases.

354
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,735
18-year-old with DIC.

355
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:35,236
Any idea what set it off?

356
00:18:35,238 --> 00:18:36,932
Complications happen.

357
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:40,275
The kid was in pretty bad shape
when he got to us.

358
00:18:40,277 --> 00:18:43,511
I'm also wondering why you were
in two surgeries at once.

359
00:18:43,513 --> 00:18:45,847
You left three first-years unattended?

360
00:18:47,383 --> 00:18:49,217
You know we do this all the time.

361
00:18:49,219 --> 00:18:51,619
We couldn't function efficiently
if we didn't.

362
00:18:53,422 --> 00:18:56,291
I hope Caden pulls through.

363
00:19:02,832 --> 00:19:06,001
You got a very quick appointment.

364
00:19:06,003 --> 00:19:09,048
I have connections, Shaun.

365
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:13,041
Why did you listen to Jessica but not me?

366
00:19:13,594 --> 00:19:15,377
Well, Jessica's pretty smart, too.

367
00:19:15,379 --> 00:19:18,146
Yes, but what did she tell you?

368
00:19:18,935 --> 00:19:20,548
I don't think this is a good time.

369
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:22,417
When is a good time?

370
00:19:23,719 --> 00:19:25,754
I have a lot to learn from you,

371
00:19:25,756 --> 00:19:28,456
and if you're dying,
less than two years to learn.

372
00:19:31,862 --> 00:19:33,895
Sorry to keep you waiting.

373
00:19:33,897 --> 00:19:36,831
There were some surprises on your images.

374
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:39,401
The previous diagnosis was incorrect.

375
00:19:39,403 --> 00:19:41,903
You have a Glioblastoma Multiforme

376
00:19:41,905 --> 00:19:44,072
located in your pons.

377
00:19:44,074 --> 00:19:46,408
I'm sure I don't need to tell you this,

378
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:50,172
but it's the most aggressive
form of brain cancer.

379
00:19:50,747 --> 00:19:56,584
We estimate three, maybe four months.

380
00:19:56,586 --> 00:20:00,088
I can have my assistant
get in touch with you

381
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:03,425
to refer you to a therapist
when you're ready.

382
00:20:11,115 --> 00:20:12,482
He still has low blood pressure
and thin blood,

383
00:20:12,484 --> 00:20:15,551
which means the treatment
for the MDMA didn't work.

384
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,022
So the Molly wasn't the problem?

385
00:20:17,024 --> 00:20:19,325
It certainly didn't help him,
but now we think he...

386
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:21,860
Our best guess is
Caden has a bacterial infection.

387
00:20:23,531 --> 00:20:25,698
Thanks.

388
00:20:28,668 --> 00:20:30,502
DIC?

389
00:20:30,504 --> 00:20:32,604
What happened there?

390
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,506
Uh, we're not sure yet.

391
00:20:34,508 --> 00:20:36,642
He was pretty sick when he came in.

392
00:20:36,644 --> 00:20:39,178
I guess sometimes
complications just happen.

393
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,512
Interesting choice of words.

394
00:20:40,514 --> 00:20:43,282
Eerily similar
to what Dr. Melendez said to me.

395
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:45,684
Yeah, he said it during a differential.

396
00:20:45,686 --> 00:20:47,519
I guess the phrasing just stuck with me.

397
00:20:47,521 --> 00:20:49,621
It's not like Melendez
to be that laissez-faire.

398
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:51,857
He usually likes to know
exactly why things happen.

399
00:20:51,859 --> 00:20:53,759
One of the traits I admire about him.

400
00:20:53,761 --> 00:20:55,861
Yeah, well,
we're trying to figure it out.

401
00:20:55,863 --> 00:20:58,030
But so far, the cultures are negative.

402
00:20:58,032 --> 00:20:59,732
Shaun's closing was textbook.

403
00:20:59,734 --> 00:21:01,867
Drug use doesn't seem to be a problem.

404
00:21:02,936 --> 00:21:05,471
I didn't realize Murphy did the closing.

405
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:06,638
Good for him.

406
00:21:27,827 --> 00:21:29,962
Oh, my God.

407
00:21:29,964 --> 00:21:31,163
Shaun.

408
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:34,500
Yes, yes, there are
many different explanations.

409
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:37,836
You asked me to get a second opinion.
I got a second opinion.

410
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:40,506
You asked me to get more imaging.
I got more imaging.

411
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:42,007
Shaun, you have to accept...

412
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:43,675
No, I don't accept.

413
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:45,878
I don't accept. I was right.

414
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,946
No, you were not right. I'm dying, Shaun.

415
00:21:47,948 --> 00:21:50,115
- I said - doctors make mistakes...
- Yeah, they made a mistake.

416
00:21:50,117 --> 00:21:52,518
- I have less time than we even thought!
- ...and they made a mistake.

417
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,019
Shaun was right. Shaun was right.

418
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:55,854
Imaging is unreliable.

419
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,689
The imaging that you asked me to get.

420
00:21:57,691 --> 00:22:00,459
Imaging is subject to interpretation.

421
00:22:01,562 --> 00:22:04,129
Yes, studies have shown that experts rely

422
00:22:04,131 --> 00:22:06,965
on... on... on subjective measures

423
00:22:06,967 --> 00:22:09,001
based on experience rather than object...

424
00:22:09,003 --> 00:22:10,068
No more.

425
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,437
Rather than objective... No more, no.

426
00:22:11,439 --> 00:22:12,704
- No.
- No, no. No more. No more.

427
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:15,007
- No more.
- Many theories consistent with...

428
00:22:15,009 --> 00:22:16,775
You can't do a biopsy to confirm

429
00:22:16,777 --> 00:22:18,477
because many tumors look alike.

430
00:22:18,479 --> 00:22:20,012
Some are treatable.

431
00:22:20,014 --> 00:22:22,300
- Some are curable.
- Stop, will ya?!

432
00:22:22,302 --> 00:22:23,949
Some are curable. They're curable.

433
00:22:23,951 --> 00:22:26,652
Stop, please, will ya?!
Stop, stop, stop talking!

434
00:22:26,654 --> 00:22:28,153
- Stop!
- Okay.

435
00:22:28,155 --> 00:22:29,790
Stop!

436
00:22:33,168 --> 00:22:35,727
I am not hurting you.

437
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:38,030
Oh, my God, stop.

438
00:22:38,032 --> 00:22:39,498
I'm helping you.

439
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,000
No, you're not. You're not helping.

440
00:22:42,002 --> 00:22:44,336
I don't need theories.

441
00:22:44,847 --> 00:22:46,672
I don't need white boards.

442
00:22:46,674 --> 00:22:48,040
I don't need doctors!

443
00:22:48,684 --> 00:22:51,510
I don't want to think about the tumor!

444
00:22:51,512 --> 00:22:53,679
I don't want to think about dying!

445
00:22:53,681 --> 00:22:55,180
You know what I want?

446
00:22:55,182 --> 00:22:57,449
You know what I actually want?
I want to... I want to...

447
00:22:57,451 --> 00:22:59,117
I want to go on a long drive somewhere.

448
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:00,786
I want to... I want to eat pancakes.

449
00:23:00,788 --> 00:23:02,554
I want to watch football.

450
00:23:02,556 --> 00:23:04,857
- It's not football season.
- Oh, my God.

451
00:23:04,859 --> 00:23:07,202
I know it's not football season.

452
00:23:09,964 --> 00:23:12,764
Do you mean you want to have fun?

453
00:23:17,304 --> 00:23:19,304
Yeah.

454
00:23:19,306 --> 00:23:21,473
I want to have fun.

455
00:23:24,478 --> 00:23:27,412
So you can keep fighting.

456
00:23:27,414 --> 00:23:29,183
Keep fighting if you want.

457
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:33,652
It's futile and it's stupid.

458
00:23:36,657 --> 00:23:38,409
Or you can come with me.

459
00:24:03,516 --> 00:24:05,117
How long has he been hypoxic?

460
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:06,618
It came on suddenly five minutes ago.

461
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:09,288
He's on 100% high-flow oxygen,
and his numbers aren't budging.

462
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:10,789
He's ventilating fine.

463
00:24:11,308 --> 00:24:13,292
He must have thrombosed
his pulmonary artery.

464
00:24:13,294 --> 00:24:15,594
We need to dissolve this clot
before his heart stops.

465
00:24:15,596 --> 00:24:17,129
- Jared, prep for jugular access.
- On it.

466
00:24:17,131 --> 00:24:18,697
50 milligrams T.P.A. infusion now.

467
00:24:18,699 --> 00:24:21,099
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

468
00:24:24,471 --> 00:24:26,638
Is this fun?

469
00:24:29,143 --> 00:24:32,477
The Saturday after Valentine's Day,

470
00:24:32,479 --> 00:24:34,313
her favorite day of the year,

471
00:24:34,315 --> 00:24:35,847
even more than her birthday.

472
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:40,185
The Chamber of Commerce
would decorate this place

473
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:43,322
and put out a crappy buffet meal,

474
00:24:43,324 --> 00:24:47,326
hire a deejay, and I'd put on a tux,

475
00:24:47,328 --> 00:24:50,662
and she'd put on a yellow Belle dress,

476
00:24:50,664 --> 00:24:52,140
and she'd...

477
00:24:52,967 --> 00:24:56,501
pin my bow tie on me,

478
00:24:56,503 --> 00:25:00,772
and I'd pin a little
yellow corsage on her.

479
00:25:00,774 --> 00:25:05,944
And we'd come and we'd eat
and we'd... and we'd dance.

480
00:25:09,283 --> 00:25:12,117
♪ Whenever I see your smiling face ♪

481
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:14,219
♪ I have to smile myself

482
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:16,955
♪ Because I love you

483
00:25:16,957 --> 00:25:18,790
♪ Yes, I do

484
00:25:18,792 --> 00:25:20,325
I love you, sweetie.

485
00:25:20,327 --> 00:25:22,861
I love you more.

486
00:25:22,863 --> 00:25:24,496
Oh, you think so, huh?

487
00:25:24,498 --> 00:25:26,231
Well, I'll tell you what.

488
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:28,634
You can take how much you love me,

489
00:25:28,636 --> 00:25:30,702
which I know is quite a lot,

490
00:25:30,704 --> 00:25:34,139
and then you can double it,
and then you can add 10,

491
00:25:34,141 --> 00:25:36,174
and that's how much I love you.

492
00:25:36,176 --> 00:25:39,478
♪ Tell me how much longer,
if it grows stronger every day ♪

493
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,948
I love you more.

494
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:45,984
♪ Oh, how much longer?

495
00:25:45,986 --> 00:25:49,154
♪ I thought I was in love
a couple of times before ♪

496
00:25:49,156 --> 00:25:51,156
♪ With the girl next door

497
00:25:51,575 --> 00:25:57,329
And I remember thinking,
"This is the moment...

498
00:25:58,373 --> 00:26:00,599
that I know will be in my mind

499
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:05,470
when I... when I...
when I close my eyes to die."

500
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:11,943
Only I thought
that she'd be sitting there,

501
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:13,597
right next to me,

502
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:18,018
and I'd hear her say it one more time.

503
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:26,992
I lost my toy scalpel.

504
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:31,830
The one that Steve gave me.

505
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:36,635
Yeah, I figured that was the one.

506
00:26:36,637 --> 00:26:39,581
I have been looking for a whole day.

507
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43,008
I think it may be gone forever.

508
00:26:48,981 --> 00:26:51,850
Maybe I'll come here when you're dead.

509
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:55,097
Okay.

510
00:26:59,092 --> 00:27:02,260
Are your memories
of your daughter enough for you?

511
00:27:04,764 --> 00:27:06,817
Not even close.

512
00:27:15,374 --> 00:27:17,275
Do you need me to listen to you anymore?

513
00:27:17,277 --> 00:27:18,610
No, Shaun, you should go.

514
00:27:18,612 --> 00:27:19,811
Okay.

515
00:27:29,155 --> 00:27:30,719
Not all the cultures are back.

516
00:27:30,721 --> 00:27:32,751
But since he's not responding
to any antibiotics,

517
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:34,109
we can rule out bacterial.

518
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:35,143
It was never a great fit.

519
00:27:35,145 --> 00:27:36,876
It's a better fit than surgical error.

520
00:27:36,878 --> 00:27:39,363
What if it is bacterial
but resistant to all...

521
00:27:39,397 --> 00:27:40,417
Then he's dead.

522
00:27:40,419 --> 00:27:42,939
What about Paroxysmal Nocturnal
Hemoglobinuria?

523
00:27:42,941 --> 00:27:44,006
PNH?

524
00:27:44,008 --> 00:27:45,708
The incidence
is literally one in a million.

525
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:47,777
What's the odds of Murphy screwing up?

526
00:27:47,779 --> 00:27:50,168
- I'd put them about that.
- No, it's not PNH.

527
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:51,741
Caden had normal flow cytometry.

528
00:27:51,743 --> 00:27:55,251
Exotic snake venom can trigger
consumptive coagulopathies.

529
00:27:55,253 --> 00:27:56,586
So can pre-eclampsia,

530
00:27:56,588 --> 00:27:58,688
but he's not pregnant
and he wasn't charming snakes.

531
00:28:01,462 --> 00:28:04,527
Murphy, any thoughts here?

532
00:28:05,041 --> 00:28:07,029
It is kind of your ass on the line.

533
00:28:26,644 --> 00:28:29,746
I know why Caden has DIC.

534
00:28:31,622 --> 00:28:35,558
I squeezed the artery between two clamps.

535
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:38,052
I must have ruptured the aortic wall,

536
00:28:38,054 --> 00:28:40,107
causing a pseudo-aneurysm.

537
00:28:40,109 --> 00:28:42,131
It was my mistake.

538
00:28:43,367 --> 00:28:45,332
And also...

539
00:28:47,417 --> 00:28:50,773
I have to make a bowel movement.

540
00:28:56,885 --> 00:28:58,181
He's lying.

541
00:28:58,762 --> 00:29:00,016
He's gonna puke.

542
00:29:01,486 --> 00:29:04,020
He's going to Glassman.

543
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:11,002
I told Dr. Melendez
I had to make a bowel movement.

544
00:29:11,029 --> 00:29:13,362
I think he believed me.

545
00:29:13,364 --> 00:29:14,557
Color me proud.

546
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:17,200
I have the answer.

547
00:29:17,202 --> 00:29:19,535
Shaun, I hope you're referring
to your patient,

548
00:29:19,537 --> 00:29:21,037
but due to the fact that you're here,

549
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,705
pretending to be in the bathroom,

550
00:29:22,707 --> 00:29:24,874
- I kind of doubt that.
- Yes, it's your answer.

551
00:29:24,876 --> 00:29:26,375
We already...

552
00:29:26,377 --> 00:29:29,245
We already have my answer, Shaun.

553
00:29:29,247 --> 00:29:31,714
We can't do a biopsy on you

554
00:29:31,716 --> 00:29:33,649
because of the arteries in the way,

555
00:29:33,651 --> 00:29:36,219
like the arteries in Caden's abdomen,

556
00:29:36,221 --> 00:29:38,372
but we can't move the arteries
in your brain because...

557
00:29:38,374 --> 00:29:41,390
Why did we go to the carousel?

558
00:29:41,392 --> 00:29:43,459
Because you were sad.

559
00:29:43,461 --> 00:29:45,494
What didn't I want to do?

560
00:29:46,563 --> 00:29:49,065
Do you not know the answers
to these questions?

561
00:29:49,067 --> 00:29:50,574
I <i>do</i> know the answers, Shaun.

562
00:29:50,576 --> 00:29:52,579
I don't think <i>you</i> know
the answers to these questions.

563
00:29:52,581 --> 00:29:55,037
You're not hearing me. I'm dying.

564
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,319
There's still hope.

565
00:29:57,445 --> 00:29:59,531
Shaun, look at me.

566
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:02,178
Look at me, please.

567
00:30:05,034 --> 00:30:07,903
There is no hope for me.

568
00:30:08,832 --> 00:30:09,919
I mean, hope?

569
00:30:09,921 --> 00:30:11,782
What... What... What... What is hope?

570
00:30:11,784 --> 00:30:14,257
You hope the 49ers find a defense.

571
00:30:14,259 --> 00:30:16,926
You hope the number 4 bus comes on time.

572
00:30:16,928 --> 00:30:19,095
Doesn't mean they magically
learn how to tackle.

573
00:30:19,097 --> 00:30:22,220
Doesn't mean the bus driver
suddenly drives faster.

574
00:30:23,434 --> 00:30:27,103
Hope is irrelevant for me.

575
00:30:27,105 --> 00:30:30,273
Hope is painful.

576
00:30:30,812 --> 00:30:34,277
I don't want to spend
what's left of my life

577
00:30:34,279 --> 00:30:37,152
chasing my tail around in a circle.

578
00:30:38,877 --> 00:30:40,777
You understand?

579
00:30:46,624 --> 00:30:48,204
Okay.

580
00:30:50,749 --> 00:30:52,495
Okay.

581
00:31:06,243 --> 00:31:10,226
Your tumor is located
at the base of your skull.

582
00:31:10,982 --> 00:31:15,918
An open cranial biopsy
would tell us what's wrong.

583
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,421
But there are blood vessels in the way.

584
00:31:18,423 --> 00:31:22,072
The biopsy would cause
an aneurysm or a bleed.

585
00:31:22,593 --> 00:31:26,429
But if we go through
your nasal cribriform plate,

586
00:31:26,431 --> 00:31:30,099
we can cross the tentorium
on the contralateral side

587
00:31:30,101 --> 00:31:32,499
and avoid all those blood vessels.

588
00:31:34,605 --> 00:31:38,569
We can do a biopsy through your nose.

589
00:31:46,383 --> 00:31:48,791
You can't die, too.

590
00:31:56,127 --> 00:31:57,646
I have to throw up.

591
00:32:04,902 --> 00:32:06,869
So how do we do this?
Do we file a report?

592
00:32:06,871 --> 00:32:08,165
Talk to Andrews personally?

593
00:32:08,167 --> 00:32:09,634
You want to report Shaun?

594
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:12,441
I don't <i>want</i> to. I think we <i>have to.</i>

595
00:32:12,443 --> 00:32:13,776
No, you <i>want</i> to.

596
00:32:13,778 --> 00:32:15,978
And we'd certainly have to
if our sole agenda

597
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:17,413
would be to take down Shaun

598
00:32:17,415 --> 00:32:19,197
and to give you one less person
to compete against.

599
00:32:19,199 --> 00:32:21,212
And certainly, we'd absolutely "have to"

600
00:32:21,214 --> 00:32:24,420
cover up and bury
a possible fatal medical error

601
00:32:24,422 --> 00:32:26,622
if our sole agenda
was to protect a friend?

602
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:29,725
Protocol would seem to favor
the bitch over the friend.

603
00:32:29,727 --> 00:32:30,793
Thanks?

604
00:32:32,697 --> 00:32:34,764
I threw up.

605
00:32:37,067 --> 00:32:38,934
We have a duty to report errors

606
00:32:38,936 --> 00:32:40,442
so they won't happen again.

607
00:32:40,838 --> 00:32:42,571
The process saves lives.

608
00:32:42,573 --> 00:32:45,040
And exactly what errors are
we trying to avoid a repeat of?

609
00:32:45,042 --> 00:32:47,510
You worried about the next time
an autistic surgeon operates

610
00:32:47,512 --> 00:32:48,811
on a drugged-up frat kid

611
00:32:48,813 --> 00:32:50,880
after finding out his mentor
is dying of brain cancer?

612
00:32:53,817 --> 00:32:55,951
Dr. Melendez told us, Shaun.

613
00:32:55,953 --> 00:32:57,486
We're really sorry.

614
00:32:57,959 --> 00:32:59,755
It's okay.

615
00:33:00,336 --> 00:33:02,057
It's okay.

616
00:33:02,059 --> 00:33:04,727
I think he's going to be okay.

617
00:33:04,729 --> 00:33:06,562
The protocol exists

618
00:33:06,564 --> 00:33:08,230
so that we <i>don't ask questions like that.</i>

619
00:33:08,232 --> 00:33:09,999
That seems like a bad idea.

620
00:33:10,001 --> 00:33:11,434
<i>You</i> trust <i>your</i> judgment.

621
00:33:11,436 --> 00:33:13,135
Do you trust <i>Morgan's</i> judgment?

622
00:33:13,137 --> 00:33:15,185
Do you trust the judgment of all
the doctors in this building?

623
00:33:15,187 --> 00:33:17,464
If you can make judgment calls,
so can they.

624
00:33:17,466 --> 00:33:19,018
That's why we need these rules.

625
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:22,178
No, the protocol is fine
for everyone in this building,

626
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,446
except for Shaun.

627
00:33:23,448 --> 00:33:26,315
They'd reprimand any one of us,
but they will fire him.

628
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:28,150
Okay.

629
00:33:29,431 --> 00:33:30,920
We report it.

630
00:33:30,922 --> 00:33:33,870
We get the investigation, make sure
nothing like this ever happens again.

631
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:36,592
But we tell them I did it.

632
00:33:37,668 --> 00:33:40,281
They'd fire you, too.

633
00:33:40,932 --> 00:33:43,165
It's not a terrible idea.

634
00:33:43,167 --> 00:33:44,417
Jared's out the door either way.

635
00:33:44,419 --> 00:33:46,329
Can we get back to the medicine?

636
00:33:46,331 --> 00:33:47,770
Caden is still alive.

637
00:33:47,772 --> 00:33:49,171
If we can keep it that way,

638
00:33:49,173 --> 00:33:50,673
there won't be an M&M review.

639
00:33:50,675 --> 00:33:52,288
Which means no one
will be asking questions,

640
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:53,685
and no one will have to give answers.

641
00:33:53,687 --> 00:33:54,944
It all goes away.

642
00:33:54,946 --> 00:33:57,446
If Caden dies, we tell the truth

643
00:33:57,448 --> 00:33:59,729
and we face the consequences together.

644
00:34:00,404 --> 00:34:01,970
No.

645
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:04,317
No.

646
00:34:05,056 --> 00:34:09,658
I thought I'd found my toy scalpel.

647
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:14,029
We need you to come back
to the group, Murphy.

648
00:34:17,259 --> 00:34:19,627
Get me imaging on that pseudo-aneurysm.

649
00:34:31,949 --> 00:34:33,148
Hey. What's up?

650
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:35,150
Do you still feel
the same way about Dr. Murphy

651
00:34:35,152 --> 00:34:36,185
as when he got here?

652
00:34:37,855 --> 00:34:43,392
Dr. Glassman gave us
certain... assurances.

653
00:34:45,396 --> 00:34:47,563
"If Shaun proves
anything less than excellent,

654
00:34:47,565 --> 00:34:49,798
if Shaun doesn't live up
to everything I know he can do,

655
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,233
he will be immediately released,

656
00:34:51,235 --> 00:34:53,002
and I will resign my position

657
00:34:53,004 --> 00:34:54,803
as president of the hospital."

658
00:34:54,805 --> 00:34:56,739
And you wrote it down.

659
00:34:56,741 --> 00:34:58,574
I made sure it was in the minutes.

660
00:34:58,576 --> 00:35:01,076
Shaun has exceeded my expectations.

661
00:35:01,078 --> 00:35:03,245
Mine, as well, and?

662
00:35:03,835 --> 00:35:07,383
And my feelings about
Dr. Glassman have not changed.

663
00:35:08,256 --> 00:35:10,052
Thank you.

664
00:35:15,092 --> 00:35:17,026
We need to cut him open.

665
00:35:17,028 --> 00:35:18,994
We cut him open and he dies.

666
00:35:18,996 --> 00:35:22,031
He'll bleed out before we
can even get the artery exposed.

667
00:35:22,033 --> 00:35:24,533
If we <i>don't</i> cut him open, he dies.

668
00:35:26,537 --> 00:35:28,370
Don't cut him open.

669
00:35:28,372 --> 00:35:29,883
Murphy, if we don't...

670
00:35:29,885 --> 00:35:33,542
We should insert an endovascular graft

671
00:35:33,544 --> 00:35:35,578
through his leg instead.

672
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,780
Fix it from the inside out.

673
00:35:37,782 --> 00:35:40,049
I've done that for
large abdominal aorta dilations,

674
00:35:40,051 --> 00:35:42,751
but this is a lengthy
dissecting pseudo-aneurysm.

675
00:35:42,753 --> 00:35:43,886
It's safer.

676
00:35:43,888 --> 00:35:45,387
The aortic wall is already compromised.

677
00:35:45,389 --> 00:35:46,689
Could rupture completely.

678
00:35:46,691 --> 00:35:48,775
Caden could die
as soon as deflate the balloon

679
00:35:48,777 --> 00:35:51,293
- inside the graft.
- But doing nothing will kill him.

680
00:35:51,295 --> 00:35:52,494
Not definitely.

681
00:35:52,496 --> 00:35:55,064
There's still a chance Caden
will simply come out of this

682
00:35:55,066 --> 00:35:56,449
without any surgical intervention.

683
00:35:56,451 --> 00:35:57,886
5%, 10% maybe.

684
00:35:57,888 --> 00:35:59,368
Not nothing.

685
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:00,703
And we're doubling down on Shaun

686
00:36:00,705 --> 00:36:02,167
after we know he caused this problem.

687
00:36:02,169 --> 00:36:03,895
How's that gonna look at an M&M?

688
00:36:05,076 --> 00:36:07,009
I trust Shaun's idea.

689
00:36:07,523 --> 00:36:10,012
He makes mistakes no one else would make,

690
00:36:10,014 --> 00:36:13,449
but he also makes saves none of
us would have ever thought of.

691
00:36:13,451 --> 00:36:15,374
Thank you.

692
00:36:15,374 --> 00:36:16,640
You're welcome.

693
00:36:16,642 --> 00:36:18,341
I still don't think
you should be working here.

694
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:19,976
I don't think the trade-off is worth it.

695
00:36:21,829 --> 00:36:23,647
Well, let's prep him for surgery.

696
00:36:27,847 --> 00:36:29,947
Pull the guide wire, Reznick.

697
00:36:34,681 --> 00:36:36,220
I'm passing in the graft.

698
00:36:39,091 --> 00:36:41,625
You're right over the pseudoaneurysm now.

699
00:36:53,672 --> 00:36:56,507
Inflating the balloon
to deploy the graft.

700
00:37:05,283 --> 00:37:06,650
Deflating.

701
00:37:06,652 --> 00:37:08,018
Can I do it?

702
00:37:09,794 --> 00:37:11,121
It's delicate.

703
00:37:11,123 --> 00:37:12,890
No, it's not.

704
00:37:14,659 --> 00:37:18,386
And it will either work or it won't work.

705
00:37:19,554 --> 00:37:21,499
If my idea is wrong,

706
00:37:21,501 --> 00:37:25,135
he'll die as soon
as we complete this next step.

707
00:37:26,806 --> 00:37:30,007
You shouldn't have to live with that.

708
00:37:34,514 --> 00:37:37,715
Everything that happens in
this room is my responsibility.

709
00:37:41,256 --> 00:37:43,320
We'll do it together.

710
00:37:54,172 --> 00:37:55,533
Deflating.

711
00:38:22,761 --> 00:38:24,228
Nobody's going home.

712
00:38:25,997 --> 00:38:30,291
I am proud of this team
and what we accomplished today.

713
00:38:31,167 --> 00:38:33,203
Drinks are on me at Harry Hopes.

714
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:35,673
We're celebrating?

715
00:38:35,675 --> 00:38:38,709
Today was a disaster, and we got lucky.

716
00:38:39,467 --> 00:38:41,178
You're right.

717
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:44,515
But when you get lucky, you celebrate.

718
00:38:44,517 --> 00:38:45,783
Let's go.

719
00:39:00,404 --> 00:39:02,700
At some point in your career,

720
00:39:02,702 --> 00:39:04,268
you're going to kill someone.

721
00:39:05,471 --> 00:39:08,072
And I hope for your sake
there's a doctor out there

722
00:39:08,074 --> 00:39:10,107
who still believes in you when you do.

723
00:39:25,012 --> 00:39:27,725
It was there all along.

724
00:39:27,727 --> 00:39:31,161
I have to go drinking,
but I wanted you to know...

725
00:39:31,163 --> 00:39:32,596
Uh...

726
00:39:33,832 --> 00:39:35,499
Is that from an IV?

727
00:39:38,104 --> 00:39:39,737
You did the biopsy.

728
00:39:40,486 --> 00:39:42,239
I did.

729
00:39:43,609 --> 00:39:46,076
I have a low-grade glioma.

730
00:39:46,078 --> 00:39:47,778
Not a GBM?

731
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:49,847
I told you...

732
00:39:49,849 --> 00:39:51,582
Cancer, Shaun. It's still cancer.

733
00:39:52,248 --> 00:39:54,018
I have to undergo brain surgery,

734
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:55,352
which is really scary

735
00:39:55,354 --> 00:39:57,021
because I'm not the one performing it.

736
00:39:57,023 --> 00:40:00,024
Five days a week
for six weeks of radiation,

737
00:40:00,026 --> 00:40:02,760
10 more weeks of chemotherapy.

738
00:40:02,762 --> 00:40:04,628
And then?

739
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,700
And then...

740
00:40:09,702 --> 00:40:11,702
with a little luck...

741
00:40:11,704 --> 00:40:15,272
you and I can go
to the Super Bowl next season.

742
00:40:27,742 --> 00:40:29,687
You're going to live.

743
00:40:31,454 --> 00:40:33,123
There's hope.

744
00:40:36,128 --> 00:40:37,394
Now go.

745
00:40:37,396 --> 00:40:39,129
Go have some fun with your friends.

746
00:40:39,131 --> 00:40:43,300
Yes. First I have to tell Dr.
Andrews about the mistake I made.

747
00:40:43,302 --> 00:40:44,835
Shaun, y-you can't.

748
00:40:45,259 --> 00:40:49,506
Protocol is clear,
and reporting saves lives.

749
00:40:49,508 --> 00:40:52,076
And I hear Caden
is on the road to recovery,

750
00:40:52,078 --> 00:40:54,178
so your mistake
couldn't have been too bad.

751
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:55,713
No, I made a mistake.

752
00:40:55,715 --> 00:40:57,214
Shaun, I understand that.

753
00:40:57,216 --> 00:40:59,216
But Dr. Andrews will use this.

754
00:40:59,218 --> 00:41:00,851
And do you remember the commitment

755
00:41:00,853 --> 00:41:02,986
that Dr. Glassman made
when you were hired?

756
00:41:02,988 --> 00:41:05,489
I promised you'd be excellent,
right, Shaun?

757
00:41:05,491 --> 00:41:07,328
And you <i>have been excellent.</i>

758
00:41:08,115 --> 00:41:12,696
You can't give Dr. Andrews this excuse.

759
00:41:12,698 --> 00:41:15,365
I was not excellent.

760
00:41:15,367 --> 00:41:17,568
This time, I was bad.

761
00:41:19,425 --> 00:41:23,207
And surgeons have to be
excellent every time.

762
00:41:23,209 --> 00:41:24,775
Right, Shaun?

763
00:41:25,424 --> 00:41:26,877
You agree with him?

764
00:41:26,879 --> 00:41:30,262
I'm not gonna ask him to lie
to save my job.

765
00:41:31,764 --> 00:41:33,307
Don't do this.

766
00:41:35,643 --> 00:41:37,054
It's up to Shaun.

767
00:41:37,812 --> 00:41:39,757
I trust your judgment.

768
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:48,265
I'm not doing this to hurt you.

769
00:41:48,267 --> 00:41:50,067
I know.

770
00:41:50,069 --> 00:41:52,402
We are friends.

771
00:41:52,404 --> 00:41:54,120
Yes, we are.

772
00:41:54,774 --> 00:41:56,122
I love you.

773
00:41:57,009 --> 00:41:58,675
I know. I love you, too.

774
00:42:01,347 --> 00:42:02,978
I love you more.

775
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,534
