你得缓口气  让头脑清醒
You need to take a break, clear your head.

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:07,120
你需要休假
You need a vacation.

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,820
我要辞职
I'm gonna quit my job.

5
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:12,540
我不想搬去
I'm not looking forward to moving

我因为殴打同事被解雇了
I've just been fired for physically assaulting an employee.

10
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,900
做吧  把我们分开
Go ahead. Chop us in half.

11
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,680
她们什么时候能醒过来
When will they wake up?

12
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,690
按理说应该已经醒了
They should've already.

我们在哪座城市
And what city are we in?

32
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:19,340
圣何塞
San Jose.

33
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:21,360
刚才是哪三个词
And what were those three words?

34
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,220
苹果  球  房子
Apple. Ball. House.

35
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:26,540
要当心了  哈佛
Look out, Harvard.

36
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,380
我们要做更多检查以确保万无一失
We'll be doing a lot more tests to know for sure,

37
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,900
但你的心音听上去好多了
but your heart does sound better.

38
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:33,870
凯蒂呢
How's Katie?

39
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:38,730
你比她先醒  现在还很难说
You woke up before her, so too soon to tell.

40
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:41,710
几乎没有阿尔法或贝塔脑电波
There's virtually no alpha or beta brain activity.

41
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:44,450
肯定是分离手术时哪里疏忽了
We must have missed something during the separation surgery.

42
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:45,160
没有
We didn't.

43
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,290
凯蒂的血压稳定  血氧饱和也正常
Katie's BP was steady, sats were fine,

44
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:49,390
区域供血也恢复了
regional blood supplies were reconstructed.

45
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,450
跟珍妮一样  只是她醒了
Just like Jenny, yet she's awake,

46
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:52,560
凯蒂还在昏迷
Katie's in a coma.

47
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,350
凯蒂移植了新的矢状血管
Katie's got the new sagittal graft.

48
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:57,140
她的情况可能是由那条血管的血流问题造成的
A problem with blood flow in that vein could cause her condition.

49
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,660
核磁共振血管造影应该能显示移植血管是否通畅
An MRI angiogram should tell us if the graft is open or not.

50
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,490
大家好
Hello.

51
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,740
我来做血管造影
I will proceed with the angiogram.

52
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,190
莫菲  你两天没来了
Murphy, you've been gone for two days.

53
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,520
不如先说说这事
How about we start there?

54
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:09,990
好
Okay.

55
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,950
就算你跟院长说了
Just because you talked to the president

56
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:14,040
也不算批准休假
doesn't qualify as permission.

57
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,850
好  没错
Okay. Yes.

58
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,590
下次我跟我女友旅行时
I...will notify Dr. Melendez

59
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,580
会通知到梅伦德斯医生的
next time I go on a road trip with my girlfriend.

60
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:23,810
有意思
Amazing.

61
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:24,900
「旅行」
"Road trip"?

62
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:28,560
格拉斯曼医生说你是去处理私人要事了
Dr. Glassman said you were dealing with a personal crisis.

63
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,210
没错
That is true.

64
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:33,480
你知道「私人要事」的意思吗
Do you know the definition of personal crisis?

65
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:37,510
知道  一系列事件中的一个
Yes. A stage in a sequence of events

66
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:40,940
决定未来所有事情的走向的阶段
at which the trend of all future events is determined.

67
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,130
-是指死亡  生病  -对
- A death, an illness. - Yes.

68
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,070
旅行可不算
No, not a road trip.

69
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,130
好
Okay.

70
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,570
你和布朗医生去给凯蒂做血管造影
You and Dr. Browne get going on Katie's angiogram,

71
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:54,290
除非你又有私人要事要处理
unless, of course, you have any personal emergencies to attend to.

72
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:56,900
没  我的要事解决了
No. My crisis is over.

73
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:01,480
进来
Come in.

74
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,760
双胞胎怎么样了
How are the twins doing?

75
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:09,220
珍妮在恢复中
Jenny's in recovery.

76
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,320
各项数据正常  也能说话了
Her numbers look good. She's talking.

77
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:12,790
凯蒂  情况不太好
Katie -- not so good.

78
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,030
我们得聊聊莫菲
We need to talk about Murphy.

79
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,700
我说了他请私人事假了
I told you he's on personal leave.

80
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,430
对  但他可不是这么说的
Yeah, well, that's not what he said.

81
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,100
你跟他聊了
You talked to him?

82
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:22,940
对
Yes.

83
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,690
五分钟前在外科病房聊的
In the surgical unit five minutes ago.

84
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,020
这是我们为凯蒂移植的矢状血管
There's the sagittal vein graft we constructed for Katie.

85
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,370
血流通畅
It's open with good flow.

86
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,800
移植血管正常
Graft is fine.

87
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,270
这样的话  我们还是没法解释她为什么昏迷
Which means we still have no explanation for her coma.

88
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,570
放大一点
Go in closer.

89
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:47,770
大脑中静脉
The middle cerebral vein,

90
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:50,060
流出大脑的血液不足
it has low flow out of the brain.

91
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,920
你是说流出不足就代表流入不足
You're thinking low flow out means low flow in?

92
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,210
对  我就是这意思
Yes, that is what I'm thinking.

93
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:59,230
应该看看动脉流入期
We should look at the arterial inflow phase.

94
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:03,070
我们想看看动脉流入期  麻烦了
We'd like to look at the arterial inflow phase, please.

95
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:06,840
你们在路上做了什么
So, what'd you do on your trip?

96
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:12,660
有时我们去旅行
Well, sometimes - when we take a road trip,

97
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,750
是为了逃避什么
we're running away from something.

98
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,600
我吻了莉亚
I kissed Lea.

99
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:20,680
格拉斯曼医生生我的气了
And Dr. Glassman is mad at me.

100
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,290
他为什么生你的气
What is he mad at you about?

101
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,680
几乎全堵住了
It's almost entirely blocked.

102
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:32,040
威利斯环出现了畸形
And...there's a malformation in the Circle of Willis.

103
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,610
凯蒂的大脑几乎没有供血
Katie is barely getting any blood to her brain.

104
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:37,030
抱歉  肖恩
Excuse me. Shaun?

105
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,760
能跟你聊聊吗
May I speak with you, please?

106
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,560
梅伦德斯医生没有生气
Dr. Melendez -- He was not angry.

107
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,890
不  肖恩  梅伦德斯医生生你的气了
Oh, no, Shaun. Dr. Melendez is angry with you.

108
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,220
他也生我的气了
He's also angry with me.

109
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:48,670
为什么
W-why?

110
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:51,480
「为什么」  因为我替你撒谎了
"Why"? Because I lied to him for you.

111
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:53,840
你为什么跑了
Why did you run away?

112
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:56,340
我没有跑
I didn't -- didn't run away.

113
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,570
你没通知你的主治医生就走了
When you leave without notifying your attending,

114
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:01,680
撇下在医院的一切职责...
when you drop all of your responsibilities at this hospital...

115
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:06,030
你没跟包括我在内的任何人说就走了
When you leave without telling anyone, including me,

116
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:08,080
那就是跑了
then you are running away.

117
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,380
跟那姑娘去旅行有帮助吗
Did this trip with this girl help?

118
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:15,710
有  有  有帮助
Yes. Yes, it did.

119
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,700
好  怎么回事
Okay. How?

120
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,950
我会提前两周通知的
I would like to give two-weeks notice.

121
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:29,640
良     医

122
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:29,640
第一季    第十二集

123
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:38,340
妈妈  能让他们再拿些碎冰吗
Mom, can you ask them to bring me some more ice chips?

124
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,500
我去拿  宝贝
I'll get them, sweetie.

125
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:23,650
我去叫医生
I'll get a doctor.

126
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:24,540
不用
No.

127
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,470
我只是...
I'm just...

128
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,440
你走了后  这里就没人了
When you left, there was no one here.

129
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:34,930
这是我生平第一次独自一人
For the first time in my life, I was alone.

130
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,790
宝贝
Sweetie.

131
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,900
感觉很...冰冷
It felt...cold.

132
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:45,510
有时确实很冰冷
Well, sometimes it is cold.

133
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,480
知道吗
But you know what?

134
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:52,120
某天你或许会爱上这感觉
Someday, you might find that you like it.

135
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,350
非法解雇
Wrongful termination.

136
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:01,080
卡卢医生打了一位主治医生
Dr. Kalu assaulted an attending surgeon.

137
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,130
我想这在法律上也站不住脚
I don't think you have strong legal footing here.

138
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,580
背后有隐情
There's more to the story.

139
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:07,910
尼尔
但愿宝刀未老  我应该还能执教少年足球吧

140
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,820
我很同情卡卢医生
And I am sympathetic to Dr. Kalu,

141
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,450
但他也不能因此就打人
but his ends don't justify his means.

142
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:16,700
显然我们不能容忍职员...
Obviously we can't tolerate staff members --

143
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,750
可你容忍了
And yet you do.

144
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,870
请看完
Please read on.

145
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,740
大脑中动脉狭窄
The middle cerebral has narrowed.

146
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,370
直径不足两毫米
It's less than 2 millimeters.

147
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:34,450
我们绕过动脉  恢复血流
We bypass the artery here and restore blood flow.

148
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,950
切开后脑吗
Open her back up?

149
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:38,010
她才动了一场大手术
She's just been through a massive operation.

150
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:39,890
大脑组织还没稳固
The brain tissue hasn't settled.

151
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:42,150
再动一次手术很可能会让她中风
Another could very well stroke Katie out.

152
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,690
其他办法
Other options.

153
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,450
血管内
Intravascular.

154
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:49,440
做血管内超声波也没法
I don't see how an intravascular ultrasound

155
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,540
看得更清楚
gives us a better picture.

156
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,410
不是影像
No, not imaging.

157
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:53,850
他是想在血管造影室给大脑中动脉
He wants a stent in the middle cerebral artery

158
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:55,200
安装血管支架  好主意
in the angio lab. I like it.

159
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:58,260
通常只有心脏和颈动脉才做血管支架
Stenting is usually reserved for the heart and the carotid.

160
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,730
是不常见  但这个病例本身就很罕见
It's not the usual, but we are way past the usual.

161
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,070
这确实会降低中风的概率
It would lower the danger of a stroke.

162
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,820
莫菲医生  想来协助吗
Dr. Murphy, would you like to assist?

163
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,500
好
Y-Yes.

164
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,460
梅伦德斯医生  你想给我写封
Dr. Melendez, would you like to write me

165
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,000
推荐信吗
a letter of recommendation?

166
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:21,190
看见那段狭窄了吗  就在大脑中动脉
You see the narrowing there, in the horizontal segment

167
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:23,480
-水平段  -大脑中动脉
- of the middle cerebral artery. - Middle cerebral artery.

168
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:27,220
对  我听说过你
Yeah. I've heard about you.

169
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,210
老手见到你都会紧张
You're the one making the old guard nervous.

170
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:35,800
我为什么会让人紧张
W-why would I make people nervous?

171
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:38,530
因为你有天赋
'Cause you have a gift.

172
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,060
而医生们会拿同行做比较
And surgeons judge themselves against their peers,

173
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,820
现在  你处于领先
and right now, you're winning.

174
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,250
我们就位了
We're in position.

175
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,710
莫菲医生  麻烦给球囊通气
Dr. Murphy, please inflate the balloon.

176
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:56,280
再打一次造影剂
Give us another squirt of contrast.

177
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,470
血流应该已经恢复
And we should have good blood flow.

178
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:05,870
近端动脉出现夹层
Yes, the proximal end of the artery is dissecting.

179
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,380
球囊损伤了她的动脉
The balloon is damaging her artery.

180
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,670
波形图显示正在恶化
Waveform is worsening.

181
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:09,880
不能用支架了
Stent won't hold.

182
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:12,160
她会中风的  停止手术
She's gonna stroke. I'm aborting.

183
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:12,890
好
Okay.

184
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,590
波形图恢复正常
Waveform is normalizing.

185
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,440
我们又回到了起点
We're right back where we started.

186
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,010
凯蒂的脑部仍处于缺血状态
Katie's brain is starving.

187
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:33,580
我想见凯蒂
I want to see Katie.

188
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:36,990
我知道她还处于昏迷中  我还是得见她
I know she's in a coma. I still need to see her.

189
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:39,090
我想她
I miss her.

190
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,830
我们不能让你俩冒着感染的风险
We can't risk contamination for either of you.

191
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:43,420
她需要知道我在那
She needs to know I'm there.

192
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,290
我们明白
We understand.

193
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:46,320
你们不明白
You can't understand.

194
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,500
没人能明白
No one can.

195
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:49,960
我们总是相互支持
We have always been there for each other,

196
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,340
现在是她最需要我的时候  我却不在
and now when she needs me most, I'm not there.

197
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:55,120
你刚经历了一场四十小时的手术
You've just been through a 40-hour surgery.

198
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,490
我们需要你关注你自己的康复情况
We need you to focus on your own healing.

199
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:59,190
她的心脏呢
And what about her heart?

200
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:01,540
我们准备做一个心导管插入术测试
We're going to do - a cardiac catheterization test

201
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,660
看看她的心脏循环状况有没有改善
to see if her heart circulation has improved.

202
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:08,340
注入造影剂  看一下心脏血液供给情况
Inject the contrast to evaluate the heart's blood supply.

203
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,210
我的灵魂看起来怎么样
How's my soul looking?

204
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,280
那是另一门学问了
That's a different specialty.

205
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:19,350
凯蒂说眼睛是灵魂的窗户
Katie says the eyes - are the window to the soul.

206
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,580
我说眼睛会撒谎  心才是灵魂的窗户
I say the eyes lie. It's the heart.

207
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,040
那么  目前来讲你的灵魂看起来不错
Well, then, so far your soul is looking good.

208
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:27,110
强壮  血液通畅
Strong, unobstructed blood flow.

209
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:29,830
脑室造影照片会告诉我们肌肉功能的情况
Ventriculogram will tell us how the muscle function's doing.

210
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,710
这么安静  一切还好吗
So quiet. Is everything okay?

211
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,840
心室僵紧扩张
Ventricle's strained and dilated.

212
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,000
我们本希望在分离后有所改善
We were hoping for some improvement post-separation,

213
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,640
但它几乎不运作了
but it's barely pumping.

214
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,370
没道理啊
It just doesn't make any sense.

215
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:54,520
分离手术本应
The separation was supposed

216
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,100
缓解珍妮心脏的压力
to relieve the stress on Jenny's heart.

217
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:58,900
需求减半  工作量减半
Half the need, half the work.

218
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,130
珍妮的心脏甚至比看起来还弱
Jenny's heart was even sicker than it appeared.

219
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:02,180
我们没料到这种情况
Seems we couldn't see that

220
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,360
因为凯蒂的心脏承担了所有珍妮心脏的工作
because Katie's heart was doing all the work for Jenny's.

221
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,670
我们应该怎么做
What can we do to fix it?

222
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,180
移植一个新的心脏
Give her a new heart.

223
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,780
我们不可能能及时找到匹配的捐赠者的
We're not gonna find a donor match in time.

224
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:12,040
能  我们已经有能和珍妮匹配的完美的心脏了
Yes, we already have the perfect heart for Jenny.

225
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,810
同卵双胞胎  所以是匹配的
The sisters are monozygotic and therefore a genetic match.

226
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,180
但是凯蒂还活着
On the other hand, Katie is alive.

227
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,590
-她三度昏迷  -她的心脏还跳动
- She is GCS-3. - Her heart is still beating.

228
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:23,330
是  但是她已经无反应了
Yes, but she is unresponsive.

229
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:26,150
我不知道怎么让血液流回大脑
And I don't see a way to return blood flow to the brain.

230
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:29,060
十之八九  凯蒂不会醒过来了
In all likelihood, Katie's not coming back.

231
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,660
是  凯蒂很有可能会死
Yes, Katie very well may die,

232
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,070
但是我们无法预测是什么时候
but we can't predict when that'll be.

233
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:34,380
可能是今天  也可能是二十年后
It could be today. It could be 20 years from now.

234
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,840
如果凯蒂一直使用呼吸机的话
If Katie stays on the ventilator.

235
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,890
-那不是我们能决定的  -我知道
- That's not up to us. - I know.

236
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,180
但我还知道  基于这些片子
But I also know that, based on these scans,

237
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,960
珍妮可能撑不过今晚了
Jenny might not make it through the night.

238
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,580
我们得把这个告诉她妈妈
We need to propose this to the mother.

239
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,210
凯蒂不可能醒来了吗
There's no chance Katie will wake up?

240
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:04,760
我们不敢百分之百肯定
We can't say with 100% certainty,

241
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:08,000
但据我们在凯蒂的脑部扫描片子上看到的...
but from what we saw on Katie's brain scan...

242
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,490
我们几乎不抱希望
we have little reason for hope.

243
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:13,560
但是我们可以肯定
But what we can say with certainty

244
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:16,660
没有凯蒂的心脏  珍妮会死
is that without Katie's heart, Jenny will die.

245
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:19,970
能等等吗
Can we wait?

246
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,450
再等一等  也许你们能了解更多信息
Just a little. Maybe you'll know more.

247
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,060
也许会有所改变
Maybe something will change.

248
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,530
如果我们什么都不做的话
If we don't do anything,

249
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:27,550
珍妮的心脏在明早之前就会停止跳动
Jenny's heart will stop before the morning.

250
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:32,520
你们怎么...
How do you...

251
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,200
会痛吗
Would it be painful?

252
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:43,910
不会的  我们会关掉凯蒂的呼吸机
No. We simply power down Katie's ventilator.

253
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:47,110
一旦没有了设备维持生命  她就会平静离开的
Once off life support, she will peacefully pass.

254
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:05,080
你想让我们跟珍妮解释吗
Do you want us to explain this to Jenny?

255
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,920
我相信她想要在场
I'm sure she'll want to be present.

256
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,810
不
No.

257
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,370
我在她们很小的时候就教育她们
I put trust in them from an early age,

258
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:16,760
让她们相信责任会增强力量
thinking responsibility would build strength.

259
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,550
我觉得是有用的
I think it worked.

260
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,790
但是这个...
But this...

261
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:24,420
不
No.

262
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:28,230
无论如何珍妮不能知道这件事
Jenny can't be part of this in any way.

263
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,660
这会毁了她的
It'd destroy her.

264
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,890
我会告诉她凯蒂死了
I'll tell her Katie died.

265
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:45,030
「肖恩·莫菲医生
"Dr. Shaun Murphy

266
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:48,730
展现出超出他年纪的技术能力」
exhibits technical skills beyond his years."

267
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:49,610
你写的
You wrote that?

268
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:50,480
是
Yes.

269
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,300
所以我在底下签上了我的名字
That's why I signed my name at the bottom.

270
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:57,040
你觉得肖恩能在别的医院生存下去
You think Shaun survives at another hospital?

271
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,590
我觉得他在这都生存不下去
I didn't think he'd survive here.

272
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:03,330
没你的推荐  肖恩哪也去不了
Without your endorsement, Shaun isn't going anywhere.

273
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:06,800
我可能不太看得惯他
I may have my issues with him,

274
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:09,340
但是无论这个想法有多愚蠢
but no matter how stupid an idea this may be,

275
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:12,600
我不会阻止他去追求他想要的
I'm not gonna stop him from going after what he wants.

276
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,780
我旁边还有一个签名档
There's another signature line next to mine.

277
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,040
是医院院长签字的地方
It's where the president of the hospital has to sign.

278
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,920
首席肿瘤科医生
The chief oncologist.

279
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,730
这是在我来之前发生的  12月14日
This is before I came here in December of '14.

280
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,350
马歇尔医生在一次术后讨论时
Dr. Marshall shoved a scrub nurse

281
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:34,740
推了一个器械护士
during a post-op discussion of some sort.

282
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:35,760
你记得吗
Do you remember that?

283
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:36,690
记得
I do.

284
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:38,610
你的回应是和护士和解
Your response - was to settle with the nurse

285
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:40,800
而马歇尔医生则得到了一个警告
while Dr. Marshall - was let off with a warning.

286
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,750
那年的早些时候还有件几乎一样的事例
There's another almost identical instance earlier in that year.

287
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,780
在这两件案子中  有问题的医生都是白人
In both cases, the doctors in question were white.

288
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,590
他们仅受到了批评  而卡卢医生被解雇了
They were censured. Dr. Kalu was fired.

289
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:55,430
你觉得  这是种族问题
You think - this was a racial matter?

290
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:58,740
你觉得我种族歧视
Do you think I'm racist?

291
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:01,420
我更偏向白人
That I favor white people?

292
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,590
那为什么那时候宽大处理  现在却不行
Then why the leniency then and not now?

293
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,470
他们是明日之星...
They're stars...

294
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:11,450
碰巧是白人而已
that happened to be white.

295
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:15,850
像马歇尔那样的医生让圣何塞圣文德医院
Doctors like Marshall allow St. Bonaventure

296
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:18,710
有能力和西海岸的其他机构竞争
to compete with other West Coast institutions.

297
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,230
所以  那就是我们的辩词
So, that's our defense?

298
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:21,140
「我们不是种族歧视
"We're not racist.

299
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:23,400
我们只是允许我们的医生殴打他人
We just allow our doctors to assault people

300
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,150
只要他们能带来足够多的捐赠人」
as long as they bring in enough donors."

301
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,780
他们被惩戒了
They were reprimanded.

302
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:28,810
也没有再生事端
And there were no further incidents.

303
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:31,700
你觉得这套说辞在法庭上有用吗
And how do you think all of this is gonna play out in court?

304
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:36,990
和解
Settle.

305
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:41,750
好
Okay.

306
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,490
去几层
Floor?

307
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,670
四层
Four.

308
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:58,420
肖恩问梅伦德斯医生要了推荐信
Shaun asked Dr. Melendez for a letter of recommendation.

309
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,040
我知道
Yeah.

310
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,760
我只要签字  他就可以走了
All I have to do is sign it and off he goes.

311
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,400
我觉得...
I think...

312
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,020
他可能认为你生他的气了
he might think that you're mad at him.

313
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:24,870
如果你不签  就更加证实了他的想法
If you don't sign, it reinforces what he thinks.

314
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:27,310
但是如果你签了
But if you do,

315
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,090
会让他知道你是相信他的
it lets him know that you believe in him.

316
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,350
我能摸摸她吗
Can I touch her?

317
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:45,650
当然
Of course.

318
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:00,780
再见  宝贝
Goodbye, baby.

319
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:13,110
-准备好了吗  -好了
- Are you ready? - Yes.

320
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:49,090
她稳定下来了
She's stabilizing.

321
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,170
我不明白
I don't understand.

322
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:54,900
怎么了
What's going on?

323
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:59,600
凯蒂还不想死
Katie's not ready to go.

324
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,690
她能自主呼吸了
She's breathing on our own,

325
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:09,510
也就是说凯蒂的脑干功能是正常的  对吗
which means Katie has normal brain stem function, correct?

326
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:12,240
当移除呼吸机的时候  生命是可以继续
When a ventilator is removed, life can continue.

327
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,680
很少见  但是的确是可能的
It's rare, but it can happen.

328
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:15,820
这也改变不了对她清醒的预后
It doesn't change the prognosis for awakening.

329
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,710
移除了呼吸机  生命体征正常
Off the ventilator with normal vitals

330
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:20,460
也就是长期处于植物人状态  是吗
suggests long-term vegetative state, right?

331
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:21,500
是的
Yeah.

332
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:24,580
这个办法不行了
We just lost our remedy for Jenny's heart.

333
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,100
体外膜肺氧合呢
What about ECMO?

334
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,640
用机器作为珍妮心脏的替代品
Use the machine as a replacement for Jenny's heart.

335
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:31,550
能给我们争取两周的时间
Buys us... two weeks of life?

336
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:32,700
我不喜欢这个提议
I don't like it.

337
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:35,400
体外膜肺氧合需要用到血液稀释剂
ECMO requires blood thinners.

338
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,930
她刚做完脑部手术
She just had brain surgery.

339
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:38,370
这样可能会造成大出血
It could cause a catastrophic bleed.

340
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:40,010
体外膜肺氧合和可能出现的并发症
Well, ECMO and its complications

341
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:41,390
也许是我们唯一的办法了
may be our only avenue.

342
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:43,760
重新把她们连接起来
R-Re-conjoin them.

343
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:47,070
你想把她们的头部重新连接起来吗
You want -- You want to put their heads back together?

344
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,410
不是头部
Not the heads.

345
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:52,130
是大腿  股动脉
The thighs, the femoral vessels.

346
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,290
很好笑吗
Is it a funny idea?

347
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:57,430
我觉得很好笑  我居然没想到这个办法
I think it's funny - that I didn't think of it.

348
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:59,010
两个女孩的血液是完全一样的
The girls' blood is identical.

349
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:02,520
不用打抗血栓的药物  不会引发出血
No need for anti-clotting meds, so no possibility of a bleed.

350
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,630
一旦她们被连接
As long as they're attached,

351
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:05,170
凯蒂的心脏就能为珍妮供血
Katie's heart will beat for Jenny.

352
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:06,340
如果凯蒂去世了
When Katie dies,

353
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,890
我们就切断她们股部的血管连接
we sever the femoral connection

354
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:11,290
将凯蒂的心脏移植给珍妮
and transplant Katie's heart into Jenny.

355
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,340
我们刚花了四十个小时将她们分开
We just spent 40 hours separating them,

356
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:18,300
现在我们又要将她们重新连接到一起
and now we want - to put them back together.

357
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:21,950
你想让凯蒂死去
You tried to kill Katie?

358
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:22,860
不
No.

359
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:26,300
你们撤掉了她的生命支持系统
You took her off life support.

360
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,510
你觉得这是什么
What do you call that?

361
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,210
仁慈  不仅仅是对于她
Mercy. Not just for her.

362
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:34,870
如果没有新的心脏  你就会死
You need a heart or you're going to die.

363
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,500
凯蒂还活着
Katie's alive.

364
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,800
她本来就活着  现在更有生命力了
She was then, and she's even more now.

365
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,040
凯蒂活着只是指她的器官功能还没有衰退
Katie's alive in the sense that she has basic organ function,

366
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,710
但她的大脑没有任何高级认知活动
but she has no higher-cognitive brain activity.

367
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:52,150
她尚且留有一口气
She's surviving,

368
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:54,680
但不能算活过来了
but she is not living.

369
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,970
几个小时前
Hours ago,

370
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,830
直到你要终止她的生命时
you thought she'd die

371
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,380
你还觉得她会死
as soon as you pulled the plug.

372
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,310
你判断错了
You were wrong.

373
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:12,520
我怎么知道你这次没有判断错呢
How do I know you're not wrong this time, too?

374
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,650
凯蒂现在处于昏迷状态
The demand on -- on Katie's heart

375
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,430
她对心脏的需要是很小的
is minimal in her resting state.

376
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:21,420
她要帮你是很轻松的
She can easily tolerate helping you.

377
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:29,470
我不想让凯蒂做我的生命支持机器
I won't ask Katie to be my life-support machine.

378
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,160
安德鲁斯医生
Dr. Andrews.

379
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,530
让她们姐妹俩在一个房间过夜吧
Let's put the sisters in the same room overnight.

380
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,880
我觉得珍妮没有把自己看作一个独立的个体
I don't think that Jenny sees herself as an individual yet.

381
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:09,900
我觉得唯一能让珍妮改变想法
You know, I'm thinking the only thing that'll change Jenny's mind

382
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,580
重新跟凯蒂连接在一起的只有凯蒂
about the reattachment is Katie.

383
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,790
让她们俩靠近些也许能让珍妮看见
Being close might help Jenny to

384
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:16,020
凯蒂已经撑不了多久了
see her as lifeless.

385
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:17,840
也可能会起到反作用...
Could backfire...

386
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:20,870
让她更加觉得自己在亲手杀死她姐姐
and cement her feelings that she's killing her sister.

387
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:22,260
是有这种可能
Yeah, possibly.

388
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:27,050
反正现在的状况也好不到哪儿去
And then we're in the same position anyways.

389
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,110
好吧  就按你说的办
Okay, do it.

390
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,600
那这个棒球呢
Well, what about baseballs

391
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,390
这是本姑娘在巨人队比赛的时候拿到的
that this girl caught at a Giants game

392
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:41,040
亨特·彭斯还在上面签名了
signed by Mr. Hunter Pence?

393
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,330
虽然他没击过这个球  但也无所谓
He didn't hit it, but that doesn't matter.

394
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,200
-体育用品放在哪儿  -这儿
- So, where is the sporting-goods one? - There.

395
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:53,030
不  这个不放在体育用品里
Oh, no, that does not go in sporting goods.

396
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,040
不放在那儿吗
It doesn't?

397
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,260
我在申请去宾夕法尼亚州  郝尔希镇
I'm applying to move my residency to

398
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,950
继续做住院医生
Hershey, Pennsylvania.

399
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:03,430
真的吗
Really?

400
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:06,310
是的  宾州州立医疗中心
Yes. Penn State Medical Center.

401
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,770
你是跟着我去宾州的吗
Are you following me?

402
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,780
我得确保你这么做
I need to make sure

403
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:20,100
不仅仅是为了离我近一些
you're not just doing this to stay close to me.

404
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:20,890
不是
No.

405
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:22,820
肖恩
Shaun.

406
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:25,270
我想过属于我自己的生活
I want my own life.

407
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:27,320
我想掌控自己的生活
I want a life that I control,

408
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,710
而不是被格拉斯曼医生控制
not Dr. Glassman.

409
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:30,580
格拉斯曼医生只是想帮你
Dr. Glassman is just trying to help you.

410
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:32,170
我不想要别人帮我
I don't want help.

411
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:37,530
但如果...你真的需要帮助呢
But what if... you need help?

412
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:43,220
如果我待在这里  我怎么知道是不是呢
How will I know if I stay?

413
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:50,740
东西太多了  你东西太多了
Too much stuff. You have too much stuff.

414
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,430
我们应该安排一次旅行
We should book a trip.

415
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,890
或许可以去个暖和点的地方
Maybe somewhere warm.

416
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:12,480
你动作太慢了
You are so slow.

417
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,660
你就叠叠内衣而已  内衣叠起来多方便
You're only folding underwear. Underwear's easy.

418
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:17,440
好吧
Okay.

419
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:19,790
别  尼尔  我不想...
No, Neil, I don't want to...

420
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,290
好吧
Fine.

421
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,700
开始吧  普莱斯顿
Let's go, Preston.

422
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:29,710
我准备好了
I'm ready.

423
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,070
开始
Go.

424
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:53,810
你是我这一天里唯一的美好
You're the only good thing about my day.

425
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:50,440
我昨晚夜不能寐
I couldn't sleep last night.

426
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:57,310
我连眼睛都没法闭上  直到...
I couldn't even close my eyes until...

427
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,040
我能用手感受到凯蒂的心脏跳动
I could feel Katie's heart beat in my hand.

428
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,910
如果我们重新连接在一起
If I do this,

429
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:18,530
某种意义上来说凯蒂的心脏会为我跳动  是吗
at some point Katie's heart will beat for me, right?

430
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,190
计划是这样的
That's the plan.

431
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:35,740
那无论我走到哪儿  她会永远陪着我
Then wherever I go, she will always be with me.

432
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,130
好吧  我同意
Okay. I'll do it.

433
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,910
你感觉怎么样  珍妮
How you doing, Jenny?

434
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:00,300
我没任何感觉
I can't feel anything.

435
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:02,580
这是局部麻醉药的效果
That would be the magic of local anesthetic.

436
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:11,120
血管都夹住了  好了  医生们
Vessels are clamped. Okay, Doctor.

437
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:13,690
准备开始进行血管吻合术
We're ready to proceed with the anastomotic grafts.

438
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:39,930
完成了  是吗
It's done, isn't it?

439
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,540
我能感觉得到
I can tell.

440
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,760
请把两姐妹的生命体征放到一起
Let's put both the girls' vitals next to each other, please.

441
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:54,470
加把劲啊
Come on now.

442
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,930
给她们几个心动周期的时间调整
Give it a few cardiac cycles to adjust.

443
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,600
我们怎么样
How'd we do?

444
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,620
你们很棒
You did great.

445
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,580
为什么去郝尔希镇
Why Hershey?

446
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:29,990
莉亚要搬去那儿了
Lea is moving there.

447
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,490
那儿的糖块挺好吃的
Well, they-- they make good candy bars.

448
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:39,780
我不喜欢糖块
I don't like candy bars.

449
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,640
我喜欢吃煎饼
I love pancakes.

450
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,680
那儿也有煎饼
Well, they make those, too.

451
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,070
我把你带来这儿是因为...
I brought you here because...

452
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:59,800
我觉得这儿可以锻炼你的能力
I thought this place would provide a challenge for your abilities.

453
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,110
但我发现我带你来这儿的真正原因
But I realized I really brought you here

454
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:06,350
是我觉得你会需要我
because I thought you needed me.

455
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:23,350
这封推荐信我已经签好名了
This is a now signed letter of recommendation.

456
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:25,960
但是...
But...

457
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,780
我不想让你走
I don't want you to go.

458
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,420
如果你留下来  我会退让  我会...
If you stay, I'll-- I'll back off. I'll...

459
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:39,990
我会让你自己做选择  自己去犯错
I'll let you make your own choices, your own mistakes.

460
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:01,020
我相信你  肖恩
I believe in you, Shaun.

461
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:16,020
她们的血压下降了
Their blood pressure dropped.

462
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:19,830
下降了五毫米汞柱
5 millimeters of Mercury.

463
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:22,300
我喜欢听你说「我们」
I like when you say "Their."

464
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,040
的确可能会有一些波动
You're gonna see some fluctuation.

465
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:27,320
每过一个心动周期  血压都下降五毫米汞柱
BP drops 5 millimeters every complete cardiac circulation.

466
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:30,250
如果有波动不应该是不规律的吗
Shouldn't the fluctuation be inconsistent?

467
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:31,720
也许凯蒂的心脏不像预想的那样
Maybe Katie's heart isn't picking up

468
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,630
能承受得住珍妮的负荷
the workload for Jenny as expected.

469
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:34,960
珍妮
Jenny.

470
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,540
珍妮
Jenny.

471
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:50,700
我在这儿呢  凯蒂
I'm-- I'm right h-here, Katie.

472
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:54,030
就在你旁边
Right next to you.

473
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:57,870
? It's hard to take all of this hate ?

474
00:29:54,300 --> 00:30:00,000
BGM: Break Apart by Bonobo (feat. Rhye)

475
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:02,190
? It's hard to take all of this ?

476
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:02,310
跟莫菲一起给凯蒂做个快速的全套检查
Take Murphy and get a shotgun work-up on Katie.

477
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:04,900
我要心电图  脑电图  各项化验等等
I want everything -- EKG, EEG, and labs,

478
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,540
再给珍妮做个超声心动图
and an echo on Jenny.

479
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:13,940
? This hate ?

480
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,760
凯蒂的脑电图上的阿尔法节律显示她已经苏醒了
Katie has an awake alpha rhythm on her EEG.

481
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,880
她真的很棒
She's doing remarkably well.

482
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,140
我们还没有完全确定
We're still not entirely sure

483
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:37,110
是什么导致凯蒂苏醒的
what caused Katie to regain consciousness.

484
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:38,320
把她们重新连接到一起
Attaching them again could

485
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,560
将血液输向了珍妮的身体
have redistributed fluid into Jenny's system,

486
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,950
可能也减少了凯蒂脑部的肿胀
possibly decreasing the swelling in Katie's brain.

487
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:44,240
说不好
Just don't know.

488
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:46,580
我知道
I know.

489
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:51,360
她们需要彼此  一向如此
They need each other. They always have.

490
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:56,800
现在的问题变成了是珍妮和她的心脏
The issue right now has become Jenny and her heart.

491
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:58,170
当凯蒂昏迷的时候
When Katie was in a coma,

492
00:30:58,170 --> 00:31:00,000
她心脏的新陈代谢需求是很低的
the metabolic demand on her heart was very low,

493
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,460
但现在她醒过来了
but now that she's alert and active,

494
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,610
心脏负荷不了她们两个的身体运作
there just isn't enough heart for both of them.

495
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:04,890
这是什么意思
What does that mean?

496
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:07,080
我们还在等化验结果
We're awaiting test results.

497
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:10,710
我们不确定凯蒂的心脏
We're not sure how long Katie's heart

498
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:13,300
还能负担珍妮的身体多久
can tolerate the strain of supporting Jenny's circulation.

499
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,600
我们会一直通过实验室的化验报告和
We'll closely monitor them with

500
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,490
心动图密切监测她们
cardiac labs and echoes.

501
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,320
我们要尽快为珍妮找到一颗心脏
We need to find a donor heart for Jenny as soon as possible.

502
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:27,960
不行
No.

503
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:28,910
「不行」
"No"?

504
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:32,170
我的首席执行官的工资只有你赔偿金的一半
I've had CEOs settle for half of what I just got for you.

505
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,640
我不在乎钱
I don't care about the money.

506
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:36,580
这很好  甚至很令人钦佩
That's beautiful. It's admirable, even.

507
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:38,050
但是  事情就是这样
But, you see, this is how it works

508
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:40,030
因为我们生活在一个文明的社会
because we live in a civilized society --

509
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,120
他们伤害了你
they hurt you,

510
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:44,520
我们就以牙还牙  用一笔巨额支票来讨回公道
we hurt them by making them cut you a massive check.

511
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,800
我不想以牙还牙
I don't want them to hurt.

512
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,290
我想让他们把工作还给我
I want them to give me my job back.

513
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:49,500
「找回你的工作」的三分之一
A third of "Your job back" Is,

514
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:52,390
对我来说  什么都不是
by my calculation, uh, almost nothing.

515
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,350
我会付给你这笔赔偿金的三分之一
I'll pay you - a third of this settlement.

516
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,810
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

517
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:02,380
你付给我的钱比你一年赚的都多
You'll be paying me more than you earn in a year.

518
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,790
我想找回我的工作
I want my job back.

519
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,130
午餐你请客
Lunch is on you.

520
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,160
午餐我请客
Lunch is on me.

521
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,410
你为了和莉亚在一起搬到宾夕法尼亚州
Are you moving to Pennsylvania to be with Lea?

522
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,770
她知道吗
Does she know that?

523
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:27,210
莉亚知道我要搬到郝尔希镇
Lea knows I'm moving to Hershey.

524
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:30,470
是  但她知道你是为了她
Yeah, but does she know you're going there

525
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:32,210
才搬到那去的吗
because she is going there?

526
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:33,310
我不是为了她
I'm not.

527
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:40,820
莉亚让我感到幸福
Lea makes me happy.

528
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:48,170
莉亚不是唯一一个可以让你感到幸福的人
Well, Lea's not the only one that can do that.

529
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:53,900
我会想你的
I'm gonna miss you.

530
00:32:57,990 --> 00:32:59,320
你们的脑利钠肽结果
Your BNP.

531
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:03,810
珍妮·昆克尔的心脏蛋白水平很...
Jenny Kunkler's - cardio protein levels are...

532
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:05,710
我从没见过这样的结果
I've never seen anything like it.

533
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:10,300
这是因为这是两颗心脏的蛋白水平  不是一颗
That's because the levels are for two hearts, not one.

534
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:12,330
珍妮在杀死凯蒂
Now Jenny is killing Katie!

535
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:18,060
-发生了什么  -我们现在要把她们分开
- What's going on? - We got to separate them now

536
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,810
-否则她们两个都要死  -双胞胎送过来了吗
- or we're gonna lose them both. - We got the twins on the way?

537
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:20,840
在路上
In transit.

538
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:28,100
JL在路上进行了局麻
J.L.'s gonna do a local on the fly.

539
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:32,680
听我数  三  二  一
On my count. Three, two, one.

540
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:38,600
我们不能分开  你会死的
We can't do this. You'll die.

541
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:40,330
我们得做
We're gonna do it.

542
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:41,260
不行
No.

543
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:43,490
我们得一起决定
We're in this together.

544
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,790
我们一直都是这样
The way we've always been.

545
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,450
我们永远都会这样
The way we were meant to be.

546
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:56,320
是珍妮  她出现室颤
It's Jenny! She's in v-fib!

547
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,830
立刻推注一毫克肾上腺素
Push a milligram epinephrine now!

548
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:59,020
准备人工通气
Prepping Ambu bag.

549
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,130
莫菲  开始胸外按压
Murphy, start chest compressions!

550
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,250
是珍妮
It's Jenny.

551
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,730
她的心脏已经彻底衰竭
Her heart had nothing left to give.

552
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,060
凯蒂呢
Katie?

553
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,640
她的情况稳定了
She's stable.

554
00:34:50,410 --> 00:34:52,070
她的生命体征平稳
Her vitals are good,

这个病例简直不可思议

574
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,830
先说清楚  杰瑞德

575
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:53,870
我觉得你不应该出现在这里

我向普莱斯顿小姐说的都是事实

585
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,230
那只是你和你的律师为了利益而找的托词

? At the end of the day, you were helpless ?

611
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,680
? Can you keep me close? ?

612
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:05,810
? Can you love me most? ?

613
