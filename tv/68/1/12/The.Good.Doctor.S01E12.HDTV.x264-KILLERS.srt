1
00:00:00,516 --> 00:00:02,414
<i>Previously on "The Good Doctor"...</i>

2
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:04,960
You need to take a break,
clear your head.

3
00:00:05,031 --> 00:00:06,328
You need a vacation.

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,467
I'm gonna quit my job.

5
00:00:09,469 --> 00:00:12,103
I'm not looking forward to moving

6
00:00:12,105 --> 00:00:13,738
to Hershey, Pennsylvania.

7
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,406
I don't want kids.

8
00:00:16,508 --> 00:00:18,075
Ever.

9
00:00:20,512 --> 00:00:21,746
I've just been fired

10
00:00:21,748 --> 00:00:23,414
for physically assaulting an employee.

11
00:00:24,716 --> 00:00:26,417
Go ahead. Chop us in half.

12
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:29,357
When will they wake up?

13
00:00:29,422 --> 00:00:31,656
They should've already.

14
00:00:49,809 --> 00:00:51,809
We were worried about you, Jenny.

15
00:00:51,811 --> 00:00:53,778
So glad you're back.

16
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,846
I am gonna give you three words.

17
00:00:55,848 --> 00:00:57,048
Try to remember them.

18
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:00,618
Apple. Ball. House.

19
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:03,187
Can you count back from 100 by 7 for me?

20
00:01:03,189 --> 00:01:05,856
I'm going to Harvard, you know.

21
00:01:08,494 --> 00:01:16,233
93, 86, 79, 72, 65.

22
00:01:16,235 --> 00:01:17,768
And what city are we in?

23
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:19,270
San Jose.

24
00:01:19,272 --> 00:01:20,671
And what were those three words?

25
00:01:20,673 --> 00:01:24,041
Apple. Ball. House.

26
00:01:24,043 --> 00:01:26,610
Look out, Harvard.

27
00:01:26,612 --> 00:01:28,746
We'll be doing a lot more tests
to know for sure,

28
00:01:28,748 --> 00:01:31,949
but your heart does sound better.

29
00:01:31,951 --> 00:01:34,351
How's Katie?

30
00:01:34,353 --> 00:01:38,556
You woke up before her,
so too soon to tell.

31
00:01:38,558 --> 00:01:41,192
There's virtually no alpha
or beta brain activity.

32
00:01:41,194 --> 00:01:43,627
We must have missed something
during the separation surgery.

33
00:01:43,629 --> 00:01:44,729
We didn't.

34
00:01:44,731 --> 00:01:46,831
Katie's BP was steady, sats were fine,

35
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:48,899
regional blood supplies
were reconstructed.

36
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:50,835
Just like Jenny, yet she's awake,

37
00:01:50,837 --> 00:01:52,169
Katie's in a coma.

38
00:01:52,171 --> 00:01:53,938
Katie's got the new sagittal graft.

39
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:56,674
A problem with blood flow in that
vein could cause her condition.

40
00:01:56,676 --> 00:01:58,676
An MRI angiogram should tell us
if the graft is open or not.

41
00:01:58,678 --> 00:01:59,710
Hello.

42
00:02:01,613 --> 00:02:03,914
I will proceed with the angiogram.

43
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:05,249
Whoa!

44
00:02:05,251 --> 00:02:06,584
Murphy, you've been gone for two days.

45
00:02:06,586 --> 00:02:07,952
How about we start there?

46
00:02:07,954 --> 00:02:09,620
Okay.

47
00:02:09,622 --> 00:02:11,555
Just because you talked to the president

48
00:02:11,557 --> 00:02:13,324
doesn't qualify as permission.

49
00:02:13,326 --> 00:02:15,493
Okay. Yes.

50
00:02:15,495 --> 00:02:19,196
I... will notify Dr. Melendez

51
00:02:19,198 --> 00:02:21,766
next time I go on a road trip
with my girlfriend.

52
00:02:21,768 --> 00:02:23,234
Amazing.

53
00:02:23,236 --> 00:02:24,902
"Road trip"?

54
00:02:24,904 --> 00:02:27,772
Dr. Glassman said you were
dealing with a personal crisis.

55
00:02:27,774 --> 00:02:30,875
That is true.

56
00:02:30,877 --> 00:02:33,022
Do you know the definition
of personal crisis?

57
00:02:33,047 --> 00:02:37,081
Yes. A stage in a sequence of events

58
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:40,317
at which the trend of all
future events is determined.

59
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,686
- A death, an illness.
- Yes.

60
00:02:42,688 --> 00:02:44,355
No, not a road trip.

61
00:02:45,524 --> 00:02:46,724
Okay.

62
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,460
You and Dr. Browne

63
00:02:49,462 --> 00:02:51,562
get going on Katie's angiogram,
unless, of course,

64
00:02:51,564 --> 00:02:53,931
you have any personal
emergencies to attend to.

65
00:02:53,933 --> 00:02:56,500
No. My crisis is over.

66
00:03:00,306 --> 00:03:03,040
Come in.

67
00:03:03,042 --> 00:03:04,141
Hey.

68
00:03:06,044 --> 00:03:07,509
How are the twins doing?

69
00:03:07,534 --> 00:03:08,867
Jenny's in recovery.

70
00:03:08,892 --> 00:03:11,092
Her numbers look good. She's talking.

71
00:03:11,117 --> 00:03:12,449
Katie... not so good.

72
00:03:13,418 --> 00:03:15,719
We need to talk about Murphy.

73
00:03:15,721 --> 00:03:17,321
I told you he's on personal leave.

74
00:03:17,323 --> 00:03:18,923
Yeah, well, that's not what he said.

75
00:03:20,392 --> 00:03:21,392
You talked to him?

76
00:03:21,394 --> 00:03:23,260
Yes.

77
00:03:23,262 --> 00:03:25,329
In the surgical unit five minutes ago.

78
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:31,402
There's the sagittal vein graft
we constructed for Katie.

79
00:03:31,404 --> 00:03:34,271
It's open with good flow.

80
00:03:34,273 --> 00:03:36,240
Graft is fine.

81
00:03:36,242 --> 00:03:40,010
Which means we still have
no explanation for her coma.

82
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:43,180
Go in closer.

83
00:03:45,351 --> 00:03:47,618
The middle cerebral vein,

84
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,653
it has low flow out of the brain.

85
00:03:49,655 --> 00:03:51,522
You're thinking low flow out
means low flow in?

86
00:03:51,524 --> 00:03:54,258
Yes, that is what I'm thinking.

87
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:58,929
We should look at
the arterial inflow phase.

88
00:03:58,931 --> 00:04:02,533
We'd like to look at the
arterial inflow phase, please.

89
00:04:04,803 --> 00:04:06,370
So, what'd you do on your trip?

90
00:04:08,974 --> 00:04:12,443
Well, sometimes
when we take a road trip,

91
00:04:12,445 --> 00:04:14,111
we're running away from something.

92
00:04:14,113 --> 00:04:17,581
I kissed Lea.

93
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:20,718
And Dr. Glassman is mad at me.

94
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,953
What is he mad at you about?

95
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:27,124
It's almost entirely blocked.

96
00:04:27,126 --> 00:04:31,562
And... there's a malformation
in the Circle of Willis.

97
00:04:31,564 --> 00:04:34,098
Katie is barely getting
any blood to her brain.

98
00:04:35,268 --> 00:04:38,302
Excuse me. Shaun?
May I speak with you, please?

99
00:04:38,304 --> 00:04:40,971
Dr. Melendez... He was not angry.

100
00:04:40,973 --> 00:04:44,375
Oh, no, Shaun.
Dr. Melendez is angry with you.

101
00:04:44,377 --> 00:04:46,610
He's also angry with me.

102
00:04:46,612 --> 00:04:48,178
W-Why?

103
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,782
"Why"? Because I lied to him for you.

104
00:04:51,784 --> 00:04:53,717
Why did you run away?

105
00:04:53,719 --> 00:04:55,953
I didn't... didn't run away.

106
00:04:55,955 --> 00:04:57,988
When you leave without
notifying your attending,

107
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:02,293
when you drop all of your
responsibilities at this hospital...

108
00:05:02,295 --> 00:05:05,529
When you leave without
telling anyone, including me,

109
00:05:05,531 --> 00:05:08,766
then you are running away.

110
00:05:08,768 --> 00:05:10,801
Did this trip with this girl help?

111
00:05:12,837 --> 00:05:15,239
Yes. Yes, it did.

112
00:05:15,241 --> 00:05:18,208
Okay. How?

113
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:23,547
I would like to give two-weeks notice.

114

115
00:05:33,592 --> 00:05:38,862
Mom, can you ask them
to bring me some more ice chips?

116
00:05:38,864 --> 00:05:40,364
I'll get them, sweetie.

117
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,207
I'll get a doctor.

118
00:06:23,209 --> 00:06:24,875
No.

119
00:06:24,877 --> 00:06:26,477
I'm just...

120
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,613
When you left, there was no one here.

121
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:35,119
For the first time in my life,
I was alone.

122
00:06:35,121 --> 00:06:37,488
Sweetie.

123
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:40,691
It felt... cold.

124
00:06:42,794 --> 00:06:46,997
Well, sometimes it is cold.

125
00:06:46,999 --> 00:06:48,732
But you know what?

126
00:06:48,734 --> 00:06:51,802
Someday, you might find
that you like it.

127
00:06:55,975 --> 00:06:58,142
Wrongful termination.

128
00:06:58,144 --> 00:07:00,711
Dr. Kalu assaulted an attending surgeon.

129
00:07:00,713 --> 00:07:03,080
I don't think you have
strong legal footing here.

130
00:07:03,082 --> 00:07:05,516
There's more to the story.

131
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:12,256
And I am sympathetic to Dr. Kalu,

132
00:07:12,258 --> 00:07:13,991
but his ends don't justify his means.

133
00:07:13,993 --> 00:07:15,893
Obviously we can't tolerate
staff members...

134
00:07:15,895 --> 00:07:17,094
And yet you do.

135
00:07:17,096 --> 00:07:18,829
Please read on.

136
00:07:27,573 --> 00:07:29,006
The middle cerebral has narrowed.

137
00:07:29,008 --> 00:07:30,607
It's less than 2 millimeters.

138
00:07:30,609 --> 00:07:34,078
We bypass the artery here
and restore blood flow.

139
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,879
Open her back up?

140
00:07:35,881 --> 00:07:37,815
She's just been through
a massive operation.

141
00:07:37,817 --> 00:07:39,516
The brain tissue hasn't settled.

142
00:07:39,518 --> 00:07:42,052
Another could very well
stroke Katie out.

143
00:07:42,054 --> 00:07:44,188
Other options.

144
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:46,890
Intravascular.

145
00:07:46,892 --> 00:07:49,159
I don't see how
an intravascular ultrasound

146
00:07:49,161 --> 00:07:50,894
- gives us a better picture.
- No, not imaging.

147
00:07:50,896 --> 00:07:53,397
He wants a stent
in the middle cerebral artery

148
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:54,904
in the angio lab. I like it.

149
00:07:54,929 --> 00:07:57,534
Stenting is usually reserved
for the heart and the carotid.

150
00:07:57,536 --> 00:08:00,270
It's not the usual,
but we are way past the usual.

151
00:08:00,272 --> 00:08:02,706
It would lower the danger of a stroke.

152
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:07,077
Dr. Murphy, would you like to assist?

153
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:09,446
Y-Yes.

154
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:11,448
Dr. Melendez, would you like to write me

155
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,417
a letter of recommendation?

156
00:08:17,623 --> 00:08:20,724
You see the narrowing there,
in the horizontal segment

157
00:08:20,726 --> 00:08:24,328
- of the middle cerebral artery.
- Middle cerebral artery.

158
00:08:24,353 --> 00:08:27,154
Yeah. I've heard about you.

159
00:08:27,266 --> 00:08:29,299
You're the one making
the old guard nervous.

160
00:08:31,971 --> 00:08:35,072
W-Why would I make people nervous?

161
00:08:36,841 --> 00:08:39,109
'Cause you have a gift.

162
00:08:39,111 --> 00:08:41,445
And surgeons judge themselves
against their peers,

163
00:08:41,447 --> 00:08:43,147
and right now, you're winning.

164
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:46,850
We're in position.

165
00:08:46,852 --> 00:08:49,219
Dr. Murphy, please inflate the balloon.

166
00:08:54,025 --> 00:08:56,026
Give us another squirt of contrast.

167
00:08:56,028 --> 00:08:59,997
And we should have good blood flow.

168
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:05,335
Yes, the proximal end
of the artery is dissecting.

169
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:06,837
The balloon is damaging her artery.

170
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:08,338
Waveform is worsening.

171
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,573
Stent won't hold.

172
00:09:09,575 --> 00:09:11,729
She's gonna stroke. I'm aborting.

173
00:09:11,754 --> 00:09:13,277
Okay.

174
00:09:20,219 --> 00:09:23,086
Waveform is normalizing.

175
00:09:23,088 --> 00:09:25,722
We're right back where we started.

176
00:09:25,724 --> 00:09:27,624
Katie's brain is starving.

177
00:09:31,197 --> 00:09:33,530
I want to see Katie.

178
00:09:33,532 --> 00:09:37,134
I know she's in a coma.
I still need to see her.

179
00:09:37,136 --> 00:09:38,702
I miss her.

180
00:09:38,704 --> 00:09:41,171
We can't risk contamination
for either of you.

181
00:09:41,173 --> 00:09:42,773
She needs to know I'm there.

182
00:09:42,775 --> 00:09:43,774
We understand.

183
00:09:43,776 --> 00:09:45,909
You <i>can't</i> understand.

184
00:09:45,911 --> 00:09:47,277
No one can.

185
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,413
We have always been there
for each other,

186
00:09:49,415 --> 00:09:51,815
and now when she needs me most,
I'm not there.

187
00:09:51,817 --> 00:09:54,618
You've just been through
a 40-hour surgery.

188
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,954
We need you to focus
on your own healing.

189
00:09:56,956 --> 00:09:58,622
And what about her heart?

190
00:09:58,624 --> 00:10:01,124
We're going to do
a cardiac catheterization test

191
00:10:01,126 --> 00:10:03,026
to see if her heart circulation
has improved.

192
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:08,999
Inject the contrast to evaluate
the heart's blood supply.

193
00:10:09,001 --> 00:10:10,767
How's my soul looking?

194
00:10:12,003 --> 00:10:14,404
That's a different specialty.

195
00:10:16,274 --> 00:10:19,443
Katie says the eyes
are the window to the soul.

196
00:10:19,445 --> 00:10:22,012
I say the eyes lie. It's the heart.

197
00:10:22,014 --> 00:10:24,681
Well, then, so far your soul
is looking good.

198
00:10:24,683 --> 00:10:26,583
Strong, unobstructed blood flow.

199
00:10:26,585 --> 00:10:29,119
Ventriculogram will tell us how
the muscle function's doing.

200
00:10:41,699 --> 00:10:44,001
So quiet. Is everything okay?

201
00:10:45,536 --> 00:10:47,204
Ventricle's strained and dilated.

202
00:10:47,206 --> 00:10:49,439
We were hoping for some
improvement post-separation,

203
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:50,807
but it's barely pumping.

204
00:10:50,809 --> 00:10:52,776
It just doesn't make any sense.

205
00:10:52,778 --> 00:10:54,077
The separation was supposed

206
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,613
to relieve the stress on Jenny's heart.

207
00:10:56,615 --> 00:10:58,282
Half the need, half the work.

208
00:10:58,284 --> 00:11:00,584
Jenny's heart was even sicker
than it appeared.

209
00:11:00,586 --> 00:11:02,419
Seems we couldn't see that
because Katie's heart

210
00:11:02,421 --> 00:11:03,620
was doing all the work for Jenny's.

211
00:11:03,622 --> 00:11:04,988
What can we do to fix it?

212
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,490
Give her a new heart.

213
00:11:06,492 --> 00:11:08,292
We're not gonna find
a donor match in time.

214
00:11:08,294 --> 00:11:11,495
Yes, we already have
the perfect heart for Jenny.

215
00:11:11,497 --> 00:11:15,499
The sisters are monozygotic
and therefore a genetic match.

216
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:18,635
On the other hand, Katie is alive.

217
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:21,038
- She is GCS-3.
- Her heart is still beating.

218
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,739
Yes, but she is unresponsive.

219
00:11:22,741 --> 00:11:25,642
And I don't see a way to return
blood flow to the brain.

220
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:28,623
In all likelihood,
Katie's not coming back.

221
00:11:28,624 --> 00:11:31,592
Yes, Katie very well may die, but
we can't predict when that'll be.

222
00:11:31,617 --> 00:11:33,717
It could be today.
It could be 20 years from now.

223
00:11:33,719 --> 00:11:35,185
If Katie stays on the ventilator.

224
00:11:35,187 --> 00:11:37,454
- That's not up to us.
- I know.

225
00:11:37,456 --> 00:11:39,656
But I also know that,
based on these scans,

226
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:41,325
Jenny might not make it
through the night.

227
00:11:44,263 --> 00:11:46,163
We need to propose this to the mother.

228
00:11:53,427 --> 00:11:56,231
There's no chance Katie will wake up?

229
00:12:00,193 --> 00:12:02,394
We can't say with 100% certainty,

230
00:12:02,419 --> 00:12:06,497
but from what we saw
on Katie's brain scan...

231
00:12:07,691 --> 00:12:09,324
we have little reason for hope.

232
00:12:09,326 --> 00:12:11,333
But what we can say with certainty

233
00:12:11,528 --> 00:12:14,329
is that without Katie's heart,
Jenny will die.

234
00:12:16,465 --> 00:12:18,379
Can we wait?

235
00:12:18,802 --> 00:12:20,377
Just a little. Maybe you'll know more.

236
00:12:20,402 --> 00:12:21,936
Maybe something will change.

237
00:12:22,035 --> 00:12:25,303
If we don't do anything, Jenny's
heart will stop before the morning.

238
00:12:29,275 --> 00:12:31,276
How do you...

239
00:12:35,682 --> 00:12:37,182
Would it be painful?

240
00:12:37,792 --> 00:12:41,853
No. We simply power down
Katie's ventilator.

241
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:44,890
Once off life support,
she will peacefully pass.

242
00:13:00,874 --> 00:13:03,008
Do you want us to explain this to Jenny?

243
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:04,509
I'm sure she'll want to be present.

244
00:13:04,544 --> 00:13:06,144
No.

245
00:13:08,782 --> 00:13:11,916
I put trust in them from an early age,

246
00:13:11,918 --> 00:13:15,019
thinking responsibility
would build strength.

247
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:19,624
I think it worked.

248
00:13:19,626 --> 00:13:21,392
But this...

249
00:13:21,394 --> 00:13:24,095
No.

250
00:13:24,097 --> 00:13:26,164
Jenny can't be part of this in any way.

251
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:27,599
It'd destroy her.

252
00:13:31,771 --> 00:13:33,805
I'll tell her Katie died.

253
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:43,381
"Dr. Shaun Murphy

254
00:13:43,383 --> 00:13:46,332
exhibits technical skills
beyond his years."

255
00:13:46,357 --> 00:13:48,319
- You wrote that?
- Yes.

256
00:13:48,321 --> 00:13:50,455
That's why I signed
my name at the bottom.

257
00:13:52,091 --> 00:13:54,692
You think Shaun survives
at another hospital?

258
00:13:55,694 --> 00:13:57,662
I didn't think he'd survive here.

259
00:13:57,664 --> 00:14:01,366
Without your endorsement,
Shaun isn't going anywhere.

260
00:14:02,735 --> 00:14:04,769
I may have my issues with him,

261
00:14:04,771 --> 00:14:07,605
but no matter how stupid
an idea this may be,

262
00:14:07,607 --> 00:14:10,441
I'm not gonna stop him
from going after what he wants.

263
00:14:12,645 --> 00:14:14,579
There's another signature line
next to mine.

264
00:14:14,581 --> 00:14:16,661
It's where the president
of the hospital has to sign.

265
00:14:23,122 --> 00:14:24,756
The chief oncologist.

266
00:14:24,758 --> 00:14:27,759
This is before I came here
in December of '14.

267
00:14:27,761 --> 00:14:30,395
Dr. Marshall shoved a scrub nurse

268
00:14:30,397 --> 00:14:32,363
during a post-op discussion
of some sort.

269
00:14:32,365 --> 00:14:33,464
Do you remember that?

270
00:14:33,466 --> 00:14:34,499
I do.

271
00:14:34,501 --> 00:14:36,534
Your response
was to settle with the nurse

272
00:14:36,536 --> 00:14:39,570
while Dr. Marshall
was let off with a warning.

273
00:14:39,572 --> 00:14:44,108
There's another almost identical
instance earlier in that year.

274
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:47,712
In both cases, the doctors
in question were white.

275
00:14:47,714 --> 00:14:50,882
They were censured. Dr. Kalu was fired.

276
00:14:51,133 --> 00:14:54,149
You think this was a racial matter?

277
00:14:54,421 --> 00:14:57,755
Do you think I'm racist?

278
00:14:57,757 --> 00:14:59,390
That I favor white people?

279
00:14:59,392 --> 00:15:03,361
Then why the leniency then and not now?

280
00:15:05,898 --> 00:15:07,598
They're stars...

281
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,301
that happened to be white.

282
00:15:10,303 --> 00:15:13,705
Doctors like Marshall
allow St. Bonaventure

283
00:15:13,707 --> 00:15:16,541
to compete with other
West Coast institutions.

284
00:15:16,543 --> 00:15:18,023
So, that's our defense?

285
00:15:18,048 --> 00:15:20,445
"We're not racist.
We just allow our doctors

286
00:15:20,447 --> 00:15:22,980
to assault people as long as
they bring in enough donors."

287
00:15:22,982 --> 00:15:24,796
They were reprimanded.

288
00:15:24,821 --> 00:15:26,555
And there were no further incidents.

289
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:29,520
And how do you think all of this
is gonna play out in court?

290
00:15:34,027 --> 00:15:35,827
Settle.

291
00:15:38,465 --> 00:15:40,031
Okay.

292
00:15:44,104 --> 00:15:45,269
Hi.

293
00:15:47,506 --> 00:15:48,673
Floor?

294
00:15:48,675 --> 00:15:49,741
Four.

295
00:15:53,012 --> 00:15:56,147
Shaun asked Dr. Melendez
for a letter of recommendation.

296
00:15:56,149 --> 00:15:59,183
Yeah.

297
00:15:59,185 --> 00:16:01,619
All I have to do is sign it
and off he goes.

298
00:16:05,424 --> 00:16:07,992
I think...

299
00:16:07,994 --> 00:16:10,928
he might think that you're mad at him.

300
00:16:18,404 --> 00:16:22,974
If you don't sign,
it reinforces what he thinks.

301
00:16:22,976 --> 00:16:26,010
But if you do,

302
00:16:26,012 --> 00:16:28,546
it lets him know
that you believe in him.

303
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,493
Can I touch her?

304
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:44,195
Of course.

305
00:16:57,043 --> 00:16:59,477
Goodbye, baby.

306
00:17:08,788 --> 00:17:11,055
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

307
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:47,124
She's stabilizing.

308
00:17:49,294 --> 00:17:51,562
I don't understand.

309
00:17:51,564 --> 00:17:53,097
What's going on?

310
00:17:55,899 --> 00:17:57,833
Katie's not ready to go.

311
00:18:01,627 --> 00:18:03,939
She's breathing on our own,
which means Katie has

312
00:18:03,978 --> 00:18:05,780
normal brain stem function, correct?

313
00:18:05,863 --> 00:18:08,404
When a ventilator is removed,
life <i>can</i> continue.

314
00:18:08,475 --> 00:18:10,174
It's rare, but it can happen.

315
00:18:10,176 --> 00:18:12,109
It doesn't change
the prognosis for awakening.

316
00:18:12,111 --> 00:18:13,989
Off the ventilator with normal vitals

317
00:18:14,036 --> 00:18:16,567
suggests long-term
vegetative state, right?

318
00:18:16,614 --> 00:18:18,637
Yeah.

319
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,651
We just lost our remedy
for Jenny's heart.

320
00:18:21,653 --> 00:18:23,686
What about ECMO?

321
00:18:23,688 --> 00:18:25,855
Use the machine as a replacement
for Jenny's heart.

322
00:18:25,857 --> 00:18:27,690
Buys us... two weeks of life?

323
00:18:27,692 --> 00:18:29,692
I don't like it.

324
00:18:29,694 --> 00:18:32,971
ECMO requires blood thinners.
She just had brain surgery.

325
00:18:32,996 --> 00:18:34,597
It could cause a catastrophic bleed.

326
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:37,567
Well, ECMO and its complications
may be our only avenue.

327
00:18:37,569 --> 00:18:39,836
R-Re-conjoin them.

328
00:18:40,838 --> 00:18:43,072
You want... You want to put
their heads back together?

329
00:18:43,074 --> 00:18:45,775
Not the heads.

330
00:18:45,777 --> 00:18:47,877
The thighs, the femoral vessels.

331
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:51,547
Is it a funny idea?

332
00:18:51,549 --> 00:18:53,649
I think it's funny
that I didn't think of it.

333
00:18:53,651 --> 00:18:55,284
The girls' blood is identical.

334
00:18:55,286 --> 00:18:58,821
No need for anti-clotting meds,
so no possibility of a bleed.

335
00:18:58,823 --> 00:19:01,424
As long as they're attached,
Katie's heart will beat for Jenny.

336
00:19:01,426 --> 00:19:04,026
When Katie dies, we sever
the femoral connection

337
00:19:04,028 --> 00:19:07,029
and transplant Katie's heart into Jenny.

338
00:19:08,866 --> 00:19:12,702
We just spent 40 hours separating them,

339
00:19:12,704 --> 00:19:15,405
and now we want
to put them back together.

340
00:19:15,407 --> 00:19:18,040
You tried to kill Katie?

341
00:19:18,042 --> 00:19:20,176
No.

342
00:19:20,178 --> 00:19:23,112
You took her off life support.

343
00:19:23,114 --> 00:19:24,841
What do you call that?

344
00:19:25,016 --> 00:19:27,771
Mercy. Not just for her.

345
00:19:28,153 --> 00:19:31,177
You need a heart or you're going to die.

346
00:19:31,498 --> 00:19:34,341
Katie's alive.

347
00:19:36,894 --> 00:19:39,962
She was then, and she's even more now.

348
00:19:39,964 --> 00:19:44,167
Katie's alive in the sense that
she has basic organ function,

349
00:19:44,169 --> 00:19:46,969
but she has no higher-cognitive
brain activity.

350
00:19:46,971 --> 00:19:49,138
She's surviving,

351
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,973
but she is not living.

352
00:19:50,975 --> 00:19:55,111
Hours ago,

353
00:19:55,113 --> 00:19:57,413
you thought she'd die

354
00:19:57,415 --> 00:20:01,317
as soon as you pulled the plug.

355
00:20:03,154 --> 00:20:04,921
You were wrong.

356
00:20:04,923 --> 00:20:08,791
How do I know you're not wrong
this time, too?

357
00:20:10,894 --> 00:20:12,795
The demand on... on Katie's heart

358
00:20:12,797 --> 00:20:14,564
is minimal in her resting state.

359
00:20:14,566 --> 00:20:18,401
She can easily tolerate helping you.

360
00:20:21,139 --> 00:20:26,008
I won't ask Katie to be
my life-support machine.

361
00:20:51,236 --> 00:20:52,602
Dr. Andrews.

362
00:20:56,139 --> 00:20:59,275
Let's put the sisters
in the same room overnight.

363
00:20:59,277 --> 00:21:03,546
I don't think that Jenny sees
herself as an individual yet.

364
00:21:03,548 --> 00:21:06,182
You know, I'm thinking the only
thing that'll change Jenny's mind

365
00:21:06,184 --> 00:21:08,518
about the reattachment is Katie.

366
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:12,188
Being close might help Jenny
to see her as lifeless.

367
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:14,457
Could backfire...

368
00:21:14,459 --> 00:21:16,826
and cement her feelings
that she's killing her sister.

369
00:21:16,828 --> 00:21:19,762
Yeah, possibly.

370
00:21:19,764 --> 00:21:23,466
And then we're in
the same position anyways.

371
00:21:24,902 --> 00:21:26,502
Okay, do it.

372
00:21:32,042 --> 00:21:33,409
Well, what about baseballs

373
00:21:33,411 --> 00:21:35,211
that this girl caught at a Giants game

374
00:21:35,213 --> 00:21:37,013
signed by Mr. Hunter Pence?

375
00:21:37,015 --> 00:21:39,248
He didn't hit it,
but that doesn't matter.

376
00:21:41,818 --> 00:21:44,921
- So, where is the sporting-goods one?
- There.

377
00:21:44,923 --> 00:21:49,225
Oh, no, that does not
go in sporting goods.

378
00:21:49,227 --> 00:21:50,293
It doesn't?

379
00:21:54,531 --> 00:21:56,132
I'm applying to move my residency

380
00:21:56,134 --> 00:21:58,334
to Hershey, Pennsylvania.

381
00:21:58,336 --> 00:21:59,869
Really?

382
00:21:59,871 --> 00:22:02,638
Yes. Penn State Medical Center.

383
00:22:05,075 --> 00:22:06,742
Are you following me?

384
00:22:11,481 --> 00:22:12,815
I need to make sure

385
00:22:12,817 --> 00:22:16,118
you're not just doing
this to stay close to me.

386
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,720
No.

387
00:22:17,722 --> 00:22:19,488
Shaun.

388
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:21,724
I want my own life.

389
00:22:21,726 --> 00:22:24,760
I want a life that I control,
not Dr. Glassman.

390
00:22:24,762 --> 00:22:26,963
Dr. Glassman is just trying to help you.

391
00:22:26,965 --> 00:22:28,364
I don't want help.

392
00:22:30,901 --> 00:22:33,703
But what if... you need help?

393
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:40,346
How will I know if I stay?

394
00:22:43,513 --> 00:22:46,749
Too much stuff. You have too much stuff.

395
00:22:54,459 --> 00:22:56,058
We should book a trip.

396
00:22:58,228 --> 00:23:00,129
Maybe somewhere warm.

397
00:23:04,736 --> 00:23:08,522
Wow. You are so slow.

398
00:23:08,573 --> 00:23:10,640
You're only folding underwear.
Underwear's easy.

399
00:23:10,642 --> 00:23:13,009
Mnh-mnh.

400
00:23:13,011 --> 00:23:14,443
Okay.

401
00:23:14,445 --> 00:23:16,278
No, Neil, I don't want to...

402
00:23:21,219 --> 00:23:22,885
Fine.

403
00:23:22,887 --> 00:23:24,920
Let's go, Preston.

404
00:23:24,922 --> 00:23:26,288
I'm ready.

405
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:27,723
Go.

406
00:23:30,495 --> 00:23:31,894
Boom.

407
00:23:48,111 --> 00:23:50,146
You're the only good thing about my day.

408
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,993
I couldn't sleep last night.

409
00:24:47,829 --> 00:24:51,924
I couldn't even close my eyes until...

410
00:24:54,393 --> 00:24:58,592
I could feel Katie's heart
beat in my hand.

411
00:25:05,523 --> 00:25:07,778
If I do this,

412
00:25:07,925 --> 00:25:12,895
at some point Katie's heart
will beat for me, right?

413
00:25:16,834 --> 00:25:18,534
That's the plan.

414
00:25:26,544 --> 00:25:30,445
Then wherever I go,
she will always be with me.

415
00:25:39,056 --> 00:25:41,323
Okay. I'll do it.

416
00:25:51,116 --> 00:25:53,016
How you doing, Jenny?

417
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:54,951
I can't feel anything.

418
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:57,254
That would be the magic
of local anesthetic.

419
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,929
Vessels are clamped. Okay, Doctor.

420
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:08,198
We're ready to proceed
with the anastomotic grafts.

421
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:35,792
It's done, isn't it?

422
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:37,427
I can tell.

423
00:26:39,163 --> 00:26:41,523
Let's put both the girls' vitals
next to each other, please.

424
00:26:47,172 --> 00:26:49,106
Come on now.

425
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:51,375
Give it a few cardiac cycles to adjust.

426
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:05,322
How'd we do?

427
00:27:05,324 --> 00:27:08,125
You did great.

428
00:27:16,869 --> 00:27:18,368
Why Hershey?

429
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:25,976
Lea is moving there.

430
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:28,545
Ah.

431
00:27:28,547 --> 00:27:31,214
Well, they... they make good candy bars.

432
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:34,618
I don't like candy bars.

433
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,453
I love pancakes.

434
00:27:36,455 --> 00:27:38,655
Well, they make those, too.

435
00:27:45,897 --> 00:27:49,065
I brought you here because...

436
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:51,868
I thought this place

437
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:54,538
would provide a challenge
for your abilities.

438
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:58,842
But I realized I really brought you here

439
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:01,144
because I thought you needed me.

440
00:28:14,592 --> 00:28:18,195
This is a now signed
letter of recommendation.

441
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:21,898
But...

442
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,667
I don't want you to go.

443
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:28,438
If you stay, I'll... I'll back off.

444
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,607
I'll...

445
00:28:30,609 --> 00:28:32,342
I'll let you make your own choices,

446
00:28:32,344 --> 00:28:34,845
your own mistakes.

447
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:55,632
I believe in you, Shaun.

448
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:11,815
Their blood pressure dropped.

449
00:29:11,817 --> 00:29:14,584
5 millimeters of Mercury.

450
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:17,087
I like when you say "their."

451
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:18,889
You're gonna see some fluctuation.

452
00:29:18,891 --> 00:29:22,058
BP drops 5 millimeters every
complete cardiac circulation.

453
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,694
Shouldn't the fluctuation
be inconsistent?

454
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:28,398
Maybe Katie's heart isn't picking up
the workload for Jenny as expected.

455
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,433
Jenny.

456
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:37,741
Jenny.

457
00:29:42,435 --> 00:29:45,315
I'm... I'm right h-here, Katie.

458
00:29:46,517 --> 00:29:49,155
Right next to you.

459
00:29:54,825 --> 00:29:57,193
Take Murphy and get
a shotgun work-up on Katie.

460
00:29:57,195 --> 00:29:59,796
I want everything... EKG, EEG, and labs,

461
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,364
and an echo on Jenny.

462
00:30:22,721 --> 00:30:25,486
Katie has an awake
alpha rhythm on her EEG.

463
00:30:25,549 --> 00:30:27,115
She's doing remarkably well.

464
00:30:27,164 --> 00:30:30,099
We're still not entirely sure what
caused Katie to regain consciousness.

465
00:30:30,127 --> 00:30:33,528
Attaching them again could have
redistributed fluid into Jenny's system,

466
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:35,783
possibly decreasing
the swelling in Katie's brain.

467
00:30:35,846 --> 00:30:38,088
Just don't know.

468
00:30:38,549 --> 00:30:40,388
I know.

469
00:30:41,418 --> 00:30:44,453
They need each other. They always have.

470
00:30:46,389 --> 00:30:50,025
The issue right now
has become Jenny and her heart.

471
00:30:50,027 --> 00:30:52,961
When Katie was in a coma, the metabolic
demand on her heart was very low,

472
00:30:52,963 --> 00:30:54,463
but now that she's alert and active,

473
00:30:54,465 --> 00:30:56,500
there just isn't enough heart
for both of them.

474
00:30:56,525 --> 00:30:58,258
What does that mean?

475
00:30:58,302 --> 00:31:00,906
We're awaiting test results.

476
00:31:01,605 --> 00:31:03,752
We're not sure how long Katie's heart

477
00:31:03,777 --> 00:31:06,345
can tolerate the strain of
supporting Jenny's circulation.

478
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:09,738
We'll closely monitor them
with cardiac labs and echoes.

479
00:31:09,847 --> 00:31:13,248
We need to find a donor heart
for Jenny as soon as possible.

480
00:31:19,873 --> 00:31:20,972
No.

481
00:31:20,997 --> 00:31:22,192
"No"?

482
00:31:22,217 --> 00:31:25,218
I've had CEOs settle for half
of what I just got for you.

483
00:31:25,243 --> 00:31:26,821
I don't care about the money.

484
00:31:26,846 --> 00:31:29,962
That's beautiful. It's admirable, even.

485
00:31:30,032 --> 00:31:32,922
But, you see, this is how it works because
we live in a civilized society...

486
00:31:32,947 --> 00:31:34,279
they hurt you,

487
00:31:34,304 --> 00:31:37,506
we hurt them by making them
cut you a massive check.

488
00:31:37,531 --> 00:31:38,997
I don't want them to hurt.

489
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:40,422
I want them to give me my job back.

490
00:31:40,511 --> 00:31:42,667
A third of "your job back" is,

491
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:45,714
by my calculation, uh, almost nothing.

492
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,268
I'll pay you a third of this settlement.

493
00:31:50,371 --> 00:31:52,838
What are you talking about?

494
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,607
You'll be paying me more
than you earn in a year.

495
00:31:55,609 --> 00:31:57,009
I want my job back.

496
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,781
Lunch is on you.

497
00:32:02,783 --> 00:32:05,751
Lunch is on me.

498
00:32:08,855 --> 00:32:11,657
Are you moving to Pennsylvania
to be with Lea?

499
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,728
Does she know that?

500
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:20,799
Lea knows I'm moving to Hershey.

501
00:32:20,801 --> 00:32:23,302
Yeah, but does she know
you're going there

502
00:32:23,304 --> 00:32:25,304
because she is going there?

503
00:32:25,306 --> 00:32:26,872
I'm not.

504
00:32:32,145 --> 00:32:33,912
Lea makes me happy.

505
00:32:38,284 --> 00:32:41,086
Well, Lea's not the only one
that can do that.

506
00:32:45,525 --> 00:32:47,125
I'm gonna miss you.

507
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:52,464
Your BNP.

508
00:32:54,701 --> 00:32:56,635
Jenny Kunkler's
cardio protein levels are...

509
00:32:56,637 --> 00:32:58,570
I've never seen anything like it.

510
00:32:58,572 --> 00:33:03,308
That's because the levels
are for two hearts, not one.

511
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:05,310
Now Jenny is killing Katie!

512
00:33:09,049 --> 00:33:11,054
- What's going on?
- We got to separate them now

513
00:33:11,085 --> 00:33:12,951
- or we're gonna lose them both.
- We got the twins on the way?

514
00:33:12,953 --> 00:33:14,152
In transit.

515
00:33:19,226 --> 00:33:20,926
J.L.'s gonna do a local on the fly.

516
00:33:22,161 --> 00:33:26,298
On my count. Three, two, one.

517
00:33:28,669 --> 00:33:31,862
We can't do this. You'll die.

518
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:33,271
We're gonna do it.

519
00:33:33,273 --> 00:33:35,040
No.

520
00:33:35,042 --> 00:33:36,742
We're in this together.

521
00:33:36,744 --> 00:33:38,777
The way we've always been.

522
00:33:38,779 --> 00:33:40,812
The way we were meant to be.

523
00:33:47,532 --> 00:33:49,085
It's Jenny! He's in v-fib!

524
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,756
Push a milligram epinephrine now!

525
00:33:50,758 --> 00:33:52,124
Prepping Ambu bag.

526
00:33:52,126 --> 00:33:54,866
Murphy, start chest compressions!

527
00:34:27,939 --> 00:34:29,634
It's Jenny.

528
00:34:30,454 --> 00:34:33,252
Her heart had nothing left to give.

529
00:34:36,598 --> 00:34:38,798
Katie?

530
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,433
She's stable.

531
00:34:40,435 --> 00:34:42,702
Her vitals are good,

532
00:34:42,704 --> 00:34:45,821
but we have an issue
that we need your help with.

533
00:34:45,846 --> 00:34:47,379
Okay.

534
00:34:47,421 --> 00:34:51,613
Um, Katie won't allow us
to separate her from Jenny.

535
00:34:51,661 --> 00:34:55,296
If she doesn't acquiesce,
Katie will clot and die.

536
00:34:57,766 --> 00:35:00,301
Bring 10,000 units on board.

537
00:35:08,411 --> 00:35:11,446
We'll clear out
and give you some privacy.

538
00:35:21,458 --> 00:35:23,024
Baby.

539
00:35:28,398 --> 00:35:30,298
We have to let her go.

540
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:34,302
I won't let them separate us.

541
00:35:34,304 --> 00:35:38,005
I never wanted to do this.

542
00:35:38,007 --> 00:35:41,609
You used to say we were
made this way for a reason.

543
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:47,882
I won't let them do this.

544
00:35:47,884 --> 00:35:49,750
Even if it kills me.

545
00:35:52,387 --> 00:35:54,856
I want you to look at your sister.

546
00:35:56,358 --> 00:35:57,992
Look at her.

547
00:36:10,673 --> 00:36:14,242
I can't lose both of my daughters.

548
00:36:36,399 --> 00:36:38,920
Dr. Andrews. Evening.

549
00:36:39,035 --> 00:36:41,102
I, uh, checked out the twins' file.

550
00:36:41,104 --> 00:36:42,236
It's an amazing case.

551
00:36:42,238 --> 00:36:46,073
To be clear, Jared,
I don't want you here.

552
00:36:46,075 --> 00:36:48,843
What we presented
to Miss Preston was the truth.

553
00:36:48,845 --> 00:36:51,479
I understand that.

554
00:36:51,481 --> 00:36:54,315
And those problem doctors
and the ways we police ourselves

555
00:36:54,317 --> 00:36:56,250
will be dealt with, should have
been dealt with a long time ago,

556
00:36:56,252 --> 00:36:57,585
but you stepped over a line.

557
00:36:57,587 --> 00:36:58,686
I fought for my job.

558
00:36:58,688 --> 00:37:01,088
You compromised your integrity.

559
00:37:02,457 --> 00:37:05,359
The incident with that jerk Coyle had
nothing to do with black or white,

560
00:37:05,361 --> 00:37:07,762
but that's what you and
your lawyer sold for leverage.

561
00:37:07,764 --> 00:37:11,032
And when you misrepresent racism
for something it's not...

562
00:37:15,038 --> 00:37:17,038
it sets us two steps back.

563
00:37:22,245 --> 00:37:24,278
She's ready.

564
00:37:32,722 --> 00:37:34,533
Jared, you're on suction.

565
00:37:40,997 --> 00:37:42,969
Mayos.

566
00:37:49,806 --> 00:37:52,100
I'm cold.

567
00:38:14,163 --> 00:38:16,197
Gone fishing.

568
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:18,165
Store's closed.

569
00:38:18,167 --> 00:38:20,234
I spoke to Claire.

570
00:38:56,172 --> 00:38:58,305
Hey.

571
00:38:58,307 --> 00:39:00,274
I want to break up.

572
00:39:04,347 --> 00:39:07,782
Why?

573
00:39:07,784 --> 00:39:10,751
Because I love you.

574
00:39:10,753 --> 00:39:12,653
Odd reason to break up with somebody.

575
00:39:13,655 --> 00:39:15,623
I want you to have everything
in your life.

576
00:39:17,726 --> 00:39:20,594
Which includes kids.

577
00:39:20,596 --> 00:39:23,397
I told you
I was willing to not have kids.

578
00:39:23,399 --> 00:39:26,500
You're gonna regret
that decision one day.

579
00:39:26,502 --> 00:39:29,303
- I won't.
- Yes, you will.

580
00:39:29,305 --> 00:39:31,972
You're just too decent
to think it, but you will.

581
00:39:31,974 --> 00:39:34,709
So what?

582
00:39:34,711 --> 00:39:36,143
We all have regrets.

583
00:39:36,145 --> 00:39:38,446
I-I wanted to play third base
for the Astros.

584
00:39:38,448 --> 00:39:40,614
It's not the same.
That is a child's dream.

585
00:39:40,616 --> 00:39:41,716
This is your life!

586
00:39:41,718 --> 00:39:43,350
This is my life,

587
00:39:43,352 --> 00:39:46,353
and it'd be more devastating
to be resented by you

588
00:39:46,984 --> 00:39:49,390
than to have my heart broken.

589
00:39:52,327 --> 00:39:58,032
And you are going to be a great dad.

590
00:40:12,148 --> 00:40:14,181
Shaun.

591
00:40:14,183 --> 00:40:17,451
I wanted to give you something.

592
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:24,158
I'm letting you borrow it.

593
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,294
Bring it when you come visit?

594
00:40:27,296 --> 00:40:29,096
Okay.

595
00:40:29,098 --> 00:40:30,564
Promise?

596
00:40:30,566 --> 00:40:32,556
You're gonna come visit, right?

597
00:40:32,668 --> 00:40:35,236
I promise. I like Hershey.

598
00:40:35,377 --> 00:40:38,868
- You've never been to Hershey.
- Lea's there.

599
00:40:45,314 --> 00:40:47,982
Can I put my arms around you?

600
00:41:02,365 --> 00:41:05,065
Are you a good doctor?

601
00:41:05,535 --> 00:41:09,870
'Cause when I think of you,
I think you are.

602
00:41:32,622 --> 00:41:35,782
Remember, I said <i>borrow.</i>

603
00:42:19,197 --> 00:42:23,397
