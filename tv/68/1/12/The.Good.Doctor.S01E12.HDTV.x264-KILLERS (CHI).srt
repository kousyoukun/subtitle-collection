has improved.

Inject the contrast to evaluate
the heart's blood supply.

That's a different specialty.

Katie says the eyes
are the window to the soul.

214
00:10:19,445 --> 00:10:22,012
I say the eyes lie. 
It's the heart.

215

Well, then, so far your soul
is looking good.

216
00:10:24,683 --> 00:10:26,583
Strong, unobstructed blood flow.

217
00:10:26,585 --> 00:10:29,119
Ventriculogram will tell us how
the muscle function's doing.

218
00:10:41,699 --> 00:10:44,001
So quiet. 
Is everything okay?

219
00:10:45,536 --> 00:10:47,204
Ventricle's strained and dilated.

220
00:10:47,206 --> 00:10:49,439
We were hoping for some
improvement post-separation,

221
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:50,807
but it's barely pumping.

222
00:10:50,809 --> 00:10:52,776
It just doesn't make any sense.

223
00:10:52,778 --> 00:10:54,077
The separation was supposed

224
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,613
to relieve the stress
on Jenny's heart.

225
00:10:56,615 --> 00:10:58,282
Half the need, half the work.

226
00:10:58,284 --> 00:11:00,584
Jenny's heart was even sicker
than it appeared.

227
00:11:00,586 --> 00:11:02,419
Seems we couldn't see that
because Katie's heart

228
00:11:02,421 --> 00:11:03,620
was doing all the
work for Jenny's.

229
00:11:03,622 --> 00:11:04,988
What can we do to fix it?

230
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,490
Give her a new heart.

231
00:11:06,492 --> 00:11:08,292
We're not gonna find
a donor match in time.

232
00:11:08,294 --> 00:11:11,495
Yes, we already have
the perfect heart for Jenny.

233
00:11:11,497 --> 00:11:15,499
The sisters are monozygotic
and therefore a genetic match.

234
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:18,635
On the other hand,
Katie is alive.

235
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:21,038
- She is GCS-3.
- Her heart is still beating.

236
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,739
Yes, but she is unresponsive.

237
00:11:22,741 --> 00:11:25,642
And I don't see a way to return
blood flow to the brain.

238
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:28,623
In all likelihood,
Katie's not coming back.

239
00:11:28,624 --> 00:11:31,592
Yes, Katie very well may die, but
we can't predict when that'll be.

It could be today.
It could be 20 years from now.

We can't say with

Jenny will die.

This is before I came here

Dr. Marshall shoved
