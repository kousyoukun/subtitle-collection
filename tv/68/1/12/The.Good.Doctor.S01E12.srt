1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,940
Previously on "The Good Doctor"...

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,790
You need to take a break, clear your head.

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:07,120
You need a vacation.

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,820
I'm gonna quit my job.

5
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:12,540
I'm not looking forward to moving

6
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,390
to Hershey, Pennsylvania.

7
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:15,960
I don't want kids.

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:17,830
Ever.

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,820
I've just been fired for physically assaulting an employee.

10
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,900
Go ahead. Chop us in half.

11
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,680
When will they wake up?

12
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,690
They should've already.

13
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:52,010
We were worried about you, Jenny.

14
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:53,450
So glad you're back.

15
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,270
I am gonna give you three words.

16
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:57,400
Try to remember them.

17
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:00,370
Apple. Ball. House.

18
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:03,770
Can you count back from 100 by 7 for me?

19
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,370
I'm going to Harvard, you know.

20
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,510
93, 86,

21
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,460
79, 72, 65.

22
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,040
And what city are we in?

23
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:19,340
San Jose.

24
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:21,360
And what were those three words?

25
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,220
Apple. Ball. House.

26
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:26,540
Look out, Harvard.

27
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,380
We'll be doing a lot more tests to know for sure,

28
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,900
but your heart does sound better.

29
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:33,870
How's Katie?

30
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:38,730
You woke up before her, so too soon to tell.

31
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:41,710
There's virtually no alpha or beta brain activity.

32
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:44,450
We must have missed something during the separation surgery.

33
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:45,160
We didn't.

34
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,290
Katie's BP was steady, sats were fine,

35
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:49,390
regional blood supplies were reconstructed.

36
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,450
Just like Jenny, yet she's awake,

37
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:52,560
Katie's in a coma.

38
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,350
Katie's got the new sagittal graft.

39
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:57,140
A problem with blood flow in that vein could cause her condition.

40
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,660
An MRI angiogram should tell us if the graft is open or not.

41
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,490
Hello.

42
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,740
I will proceed with the angiogram.

43
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,190
Murphy, you've been gone for two days.

44
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,520
How about we start there?

45
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:09,990
Okay.

46
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,950
Just because you talked to the president

47
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:14,040
doesn't qualify as permission.

48
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,850
Okay. Yes.

49
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,590
I...will notify Dr. Melendez

50
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,580
next time I go on a road trip with my girlfriend.

51
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:23,810
Amazing.

52
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:24,900
"Road trip"?

53
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:28,560
Dr. Glassman said you were dealing with a personal crisis.

54
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,210
That is true.

55
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:33,480
Do you know the definition of personal crisis?

56
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:37,510
Yes. A stage in a sequence of events

57
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:40,940
at which the trend of all future events is determined.

58
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,130
- A death, an illness. - Yes.

59
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,070
No, not a road trip.

60
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,130
Okay.

61
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,570
You and Dr. Browne get going on Katie's angiogram,

62
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:54,290
unless, of course, you have any personal emergencies to attend to.

63
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:56,900
No. My crisis is over.

64
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:01,480
Come in.

65
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,760
How are the twins doing?

66
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:09,220
Jenny's in recovery.

67
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,320
Her numbers look good. She's talking.

68
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:12,790
Katie -- not so good.

69
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,030
We need to talk about Murphy.

70
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,700
I told you he's on personal leave.

71
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,430
Yeah, well, that's not what he said.

72
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,100
You talked to him?

73
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:22,940
Yes.

74
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,690
In the surgical unit five minutes ago.

75
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,020
There's the sagittal vein graft we constructed for Katie.

76
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,370
It's open with good flow.

77
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,800
Graft is fine.

78
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,270
Which means we still have no explanation for her coma.

79
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,570
Go in closer.

80
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:47,770
The middle cerebral vein,

81
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:50,060
it has low flow out of the brain.

82
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,920
You're thinking low flow out means low flow in?

83
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,210
Yes, that is what I'm thinking.

84
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:59,230
We should look at the arterial inflow phase.

85
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:03,070
We'd like to look at the arterial inflow phase, please.

86
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:06,840
So, what'd you do on your trip?

87
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:12,660
Well, sometimes - when we take a road trip,

88
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,750
we're running away from something.

89
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,600
I kissed Lea.

90
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:20,680
And Dr. Glassman is mad at me.

91
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,290
What is he mad at you about?

92
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,680
It's almost entirely blocked.

93
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:32,040
And...there's a malformation in the Circle of Willis.

94
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,610
Katie is barely getting any blood to her brain.

95
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:37,030
Excuse me. Shaun?

96
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,760
May I speak with you, please?

97
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,560
Dr. Melendez -- He was not angry.

98
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,890
Oh, no, Shaun. Dr. Melendez is angry with you.

99
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,220
He's also angry with me.

100
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:48,670
W-why?

101
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:51,480
"Why"? Because I lied to him for you.

102
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:53,840
Why did you run away?

103
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:56,340
I didn't -- didn't run away.

104
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,570
When you leave without notifying your attending,

105
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:01,680
when you drop all of your responsibilities at this hospital...

106
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:06,030
When you leave without telling anyone, including me,

107
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:08,080
then you are running away.

108
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,380
Did this trip with this girl help?

109
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:15,710
Yes. Yes, it did.

110
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,700
Okay. How?

111
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,950
I would like to give two-weeks notice.

112
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:38,340
Mom, can you ask them to bring me some more ice chips?

113
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,500
I'll get them, sweetie.

114
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:23,650
I'll get a doctor.

115
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:24,540
No.

116
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,470
I'm just...

117
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,440
When you left, there was no one here.

118
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:34,930
For the first time in my life, I was alone.

119
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,790
Sweetie.

120
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,900
It felt...cold.

121
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:45,510
Well, sometimes it is cold.

122
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,480
But you know what?

123
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:52,120
Someday, you might find that you like it.

124
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,350
Wrongful termination.

125
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:01,080
Dr. Kalu assaulted an attending surgeon.

126
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,130
I don't think you have strong legal footing here.

127
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,580
There's more to the story.

128
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,820
And I am sympathetic to Dr. Kalu,

129
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,450
but his ends don't justify his means.

130
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:16,700
Obviously we can't tolerate staff members --

131
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,750
And yet you do.

132
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,870
Please read on.

133
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,740
The middle cerebral has narrowed.

134
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,370
It's less than 2 millimeters.

135
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:34,450
We bypass the artery here and restore blood flow.

136
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,950
Open her back up?

137
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:38,010
She's just been through a massive operation.

138
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:39,890
The brain tissue hasn't settled.

139
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:42,150
Another could very well stroke Katie out.

140
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,690
Other options.

141
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,450
Intravascular.

142
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:49,440
I don't see how an intravascular ultrasound

143
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,540
gives us a better picture.

144
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,410
No, not imaging.

145
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:53,850
He wants a stent in the middle cerebral artery

146
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:55,200
in the angio lab. I like it.

147
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:58,260
Stenting is usually reserved for the heart and the carotid.

148
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,730
It's not the usual, but we are way past the usual.

149
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,070
It would lower the danger of a stroke.

150
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,820
Dr. Murphy, would you like to assist?

151
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,500
Y-Yes.

152
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,460
Dr. Melendez, would you like to write me

153
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,000
a letter of recommendation?

154
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:21,190
You see the narrowing there, in the horizontal segment

155
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:23,480
- of the middle cerebral artery. - Middle cerebral artery.

156
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:27,220
Yeah. I've heard about you.

157
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,210
You're the one making the old guard nervous.

158
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:35,800
W-why would I make people nervous?

159
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:38,530
'Cause you have a gift.

160
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,060
And surgeons judge themselves against their peers,

161
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,820
and right now, you're winning.

162
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,250
We're in position.

163
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,710
Dr. Murphy, please inflate the balloon.

164
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:56,280
Give us another squirt of contrast.

165
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,470
And we should have good blood flow.

166
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:05,870
Yes, the proximal end of the artery is dissecting.

167
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,380
The balloon is damaging her artery.

168
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,670
Waveform is worsening.

169
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:09,880
Stent won't hold.

170
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:12,160
She's gonna stroke. I'm aborting.

171
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:12,890
Okay.

172
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,590
Waveform is normalizing.

173
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,440
We're right back where we started.

174
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,010
Katie's brain is starving.

175
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:33,580
I want to see Katie.

176
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:36,990
I know she's in a coma. I still need to see her.

177
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:39,090
I miss her.

178
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,830
We can't risk contamination for either of you.

179
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:43,420
She needs to know I'm there.

180
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,290
We understand.

181
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:46,320
You can't understand.

182
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,500
No one can.

183
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:49,960
We have always been there for each other,

184
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,340
and now when she needs me most, I'm not there.

185
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:55,120
You've just been through a 40-hour surgery.

186
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,490
We need you to focus on your own healing.

187
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:59,190
And what about her heart?

188
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:01,540
We're going to do - a cardiac catheterization test

189
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,660
to see if her heart circulation has improved.

190
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:08,340
Inject the contrast to evaluate the heart's blood supply.

191
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,210
How's my soul looking?

192
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,280
That's a different specialty.

193
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:19,350
Katie says the eyes - are the window to the soul.

194
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,580
I say the eyes lie. It's the heart.

195
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,040
Well, then, so far your soul is looking good.

196
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:27,110
Strong, unobstructed blood flow.

197
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:29,830
Ventriculogram will tell us how the muscle function's doing.

198
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,710
So quiet. Is everything okay?

199
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,840
Ventricle's strained and dilated.

200
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,000
We were hoping for some improvement post-separation,

201
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,640
but it's barely pumping.

202
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,370
It just doesn't make any sense.

203
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:54,520
The separation was supposed

204
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,100
to relieve the stress on Jenny's heart.

205
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:58,900
Half the need, half the work.

206
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,130
Jenny's heart was even sicker than it appeared.

207
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:02,180
Seems we couldn't see that

208
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,360
because Katie's heart was doing all the work for Jenny's.

209
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,670
What can we do to fix it?

210
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,180
Give her a new heart.

211
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,780
We're not gonna find a donor match in time.

212
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:12,040
Yes, we already have the perfect heart for Jenny.

213
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,810
The sisters are monozygotic and therefore a genetic match.

214
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,180
On the other hand, Katie is alive.

215
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,590
- She is GCS-3. - Her heart is still beating.

216
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:23,330
Yes, but she is unresponsive.

217
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:26,150
And I don't see a way to return blood flow to the brain.

218
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:29,060
In all likelihood, Katie's not coming back.

219
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,660
Yes, Katie very well may die,

220
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,070
but we can't predict when that'll be.

221
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:34,380
It could be today. It could be 20 years from now.

222
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,840
If Katie stays on the ventilator.

223
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,890
- That's not up to us. - I know.

224
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,180
But I also know that, based on these scans,

225
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,960
Jenny might not make it through the night.

226
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,580
We need to propose this to the mother.

227
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,210
There's no chance Katie will wake up?

228
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:04,760
We can't say with 100% certainty,

229
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:08,000
but from what we saw on Katie's brain scan...

230
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,490
we have little reason for hope.

231
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:13,560
But what we can say with certainty

232
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:16,660
is that without Katie's heart, Jenny will die.

233
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:19,970
Can we wait?

234
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,450
Just a little. Maybe you'll know more.

235
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,060
Maybe something will change.

236
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,530
If we don't do anything,

237
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:27,550
Jenny's heart will stop before the morning.

238
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:32,520
How do you...

239
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,200
Would it be painful?

240
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:43,910
No. We simply power down Katie's ventilator.

241
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:47,110
Once off life support, she will peacefully pass.

242
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:05,080
Do you want us to explain this to Jenny?

243
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,920
I'm sure she'll want to be present.

244
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,810
No.

245
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,370
I put trust in them from an early age,

246
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:16,760
thinking responsibility would build strength.

247
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,550
I think it worked.

248
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,790
But this...

249
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:24,420
No.

250
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:28,230
Jenny can't be part of this in any way.

251
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,660
It'd destroy her.

252
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,890
I'll tell her Katie died.

253
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:45,030
"Dr. Shaun Murphy

254
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:48,730
exhibits technical skills beyond his years."

255
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:49,610
You wrote that?

256
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:50,480
Yes.

257
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,300
That's why I signed my name at the bottom.

258
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:57,040
You think Shaun survives at another hospital?

259
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,590
I didn't think he'd survive here.

260
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:03,330
Without your endorsement, Shaun isn't going anywhere.

261
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:06,800
I may have my issues with him,

262
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:09,340
but no matter how stupid an idea this may be,

263
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:12,600
I'm not gonna stop him from going after what he wants.

264
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,780
There's another signature line next to mine.

265
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,040
It's where the president of the hospital has to sign.

266
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,920
The chief oncologist.

267
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,730
This is before I came here in December of '14.

268
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,350
Dr. Marshall shoved a scrub nurse

269
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:34,740
during a post-op discussion of some sort.

270
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:35,760
Do you remember that?

271
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:36,690
I do.

272
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:38,610
Your response - was to settle with the nurse

273
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:40,800
while Dr. Marshall - was let off with a warning.

274
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,750
There's another almost identical instance earlier in that year.

275
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,780
In both cases, the doctors in question were white.

276
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,590
They were censured. Dr. Kalu was fired.

277
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:55,430
You think - this was a racial matter?

278
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:58,740
Do you think I'm racist?

279
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:01,420
That I favor white people?

280
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,590
Then why the leniency then and not now?

281
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,470
They're stars...

282
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:11,450
that happened to be white.

283
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:15,850
Doctors like Marshall allow St. Bonaventure

284
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:18,710
to compete with other West Coast institutions.

285
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,230
So, that's our defense?

286
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:21,140
"We're not racist.

287
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:23,400
We just allow our doctors to assault people

288
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,150
as long as they bring in enough donors."

289
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,780
They were reprimanded.

290
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:28,810
And there were no further incidents.

291
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:31,700
And how do you think all of this is gonna play out in court?

292
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:36,990
Settle.

293
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:41,750
Okay.

294
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,490
Floor?

295
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,670
Four.

296
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:58,420
Shaun asked Dr. Melendez for a letter of recommendation.

297
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,040
Yeah.

298
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,760
All I have to do is sign it and off he goes.

299
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,400
I think...

300
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,020
he might think that you're mad at him.

301
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:24,870
If you don't sign, it reinforces what he thinks.

302
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:27,310
But if you do,

303
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,090
it lets him know that you believe in him.

304
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,350
Can I touch her?

305
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:45,650
Of course.

306
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:00,780
Goodbye, baby.

307
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:13,110
- Are you ready? - Yes.

308
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:49,090
She's stabilizing.

309
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,170
I don't understand.

310
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:54,900
What's going on?

311
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:59,600
Katie's not ready to go.

312
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,690
She's breathing on our own,

313
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:09,510
which means Katie has normal brain stem function, correct?

314
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:12,240
When a ventilator is removed, life can continue.

315
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,680
It's rare, but it can happen.

316
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:15,820
It doesn't change the prognosis for awakening.

317
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,710
Off the ventilator with normal vitals

318
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:20,460
suggests long-term vegetative state, right?

319
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:21,500
Yeah.

320
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:24,580
We just lost our remedy for Jenny's heart.

321
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,100
What about ECMO?

322
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,640
Use the machine as a replacement for Jenny's heart.

323
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:31,550
Buys us... two weeks of life?

324
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:32,700
I don't like it.

325
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:35,400
ECMO requires blood thinners.

326
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,930
She just had brain surgery.

327
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:38,370
It could cause a catastrophic bleed.

328
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:40,010
Well, ECMO and its complications

329
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:41,390
may be our only avenue.

330
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:43,760
R-Re-conjoin them.

331
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:47,070
You want -- You want to put their heads back together?

332
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,410
Not the heads.

333
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:52,130
The thighs, the femoral vessels.

334
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,290
Is it a funny idea?

335
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:57,430
I think it's funny - that I didn't think of it.

336
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:59,010
The girls' blood is identical.

337
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:02,520
No need for anti-clotting meds, so no possibility of a bleed.

338
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,630
As long as they're attached,

339
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:05,170
Katie's heart will beat for Jenny.

340
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:06,340
When Katie dies,

341
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,890
we sever the femoral connection

342
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:11,290
and transplant Katie's heart into Jenny.

343
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,340
We just spent 40 hours separating them,

344
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:18,300
and now we want - to put them back together.

345
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:21,950
You tried to kill Katie?

346
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:22,860
No.

347
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:26,300
You took her off life support.

348
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,510
What do you call that?

349
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,210
Mercy. Not just for her.

350
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:34,870
You need a heart or you're going to die.

351
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,500
Katie's alive.

352
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,800
She was then, and she's even more now.

353
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,040
Katie's alive in the sense that she has basic organ function,

354
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,710
but she has no higher-cognitive brain activity.

355
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:52,150
She's surviving,

356
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:54,680
but she is not living.

357
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,970
Hours ago,

358
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,830
you thought she'd die

359
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,380
as soon as you pulled the plug.

360
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,310
You were wrong.

361
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:12,520
How do I know you're not wrong this time, too?

362
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,650
The demand on -- on Katie's heart

363
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,430
is minimal in her resting state.

364
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:21,420
She can easily tolerate helping you.

365
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:29,470
I won't ask Katie to be my life-support machine.

366
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,160
Dr. Andrews.

367
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,530
Let's put the sisters in the same room overnight.

368
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,880
I don't think that Jenny sees herself as an individual yet.

369
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:09,900
You know, I'm thinking the only thing that'll change Jenny's mind

370
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,580
about the reattachment is Katie.

371
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,790
Being close might help Jenny to

372
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:16,020
see her as lifeless.

373
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:17,840
Could backfire...

374
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:20,870
and cement her feelings that she's killing her sister.

375
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:22,260
Yeah, possibly.

376
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:27,050
And then we're in the same position anyways.

377
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,110
Okay, do it.

378
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,600
Well, what about baseballs

379
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,390
that this girl caught at a Giants game

380
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:41,040
signed by Mr. Hunter Pence?

381
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,330
He didn't hit it, but that doesn't matter.

382
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,200
- So, where is the sporting-goods one? - There.

383
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:53,030
Oh, no, that does not go in sporting goods.

384
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,040
It doesn't?

385
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,260
I'm applying to move my residency to

386
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,950
Hershey, Pennsylvania.

387
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:03,430
Really?

388
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:06,310
Yes. Penn State Medical Center.

389
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,770
Are you following me?

390
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,780
I need to make sure

391
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:20,100
you're not just doing this to stay close to me.

392
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:20,890
No.

393
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:22,820
Shaun.

394
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:25,270
I want my own life.

395
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:27,320
I want a life that I control,

396
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,710
not Dr. Glassman.

397
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:30,580
Dr. Glassman is just trying to help you.

398
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:32,170
I don't want help.

399
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:37,530
But what if... you need help?

400
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:43,220
How will I know if I stay?

401
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:50,740
Too much stuff. You have too much stuff.

402
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,430
We should book a trip.

403
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,890
Maybe somewhere warm.

404
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:12,480
You are so slow.

405
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,660
You're only folding underwear. Underwear's easy.

406
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:17,440
Okay.

407
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:19,790
No, Neil, I don't want to...

408
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,290
Fine.

409
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,700
Let's go, Preston.

410
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:29,710
I'm ready.

411
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,070
Go.

412
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:53,810
You're the only good thing about my day.

413
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:50,440
I couldn't sleep last night.

414
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:57,310
I couldn't even close my eyes until...

415
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,040
I could feel Katie's heart beat in my hand.

416
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,910
If I do this,

417
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:18,530
at some point Katie's heart will beat for me, right?

418
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,190
That's the plan.

419
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:35,740
Then wherever I go, she will always be with me.

420
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,130
Okay. I'll do it.

421
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,910
How you doing, Jenny?

422
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:00,300
I can't feel anything.

423
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:02,580
That would be the magic of local anesthetic.

424
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:11,120
Vessels are clamped. Okay, Doctor.

425
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:13,690
We're ready to proceed with the anastomotic grafts.

426
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:39,930
It's done, isn't it?

427
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,540
I can tell.

428
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,760
Let's put both the girls' vitals next to each other, please.

429
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:54,470
Come on now.

430
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,930
Give it a few cardiac cycles to adjust.

431
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,600
How'd we do?

432
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,620
You did great.

433
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,580
Why Hershey?

434
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:29,990
Lea is moving there.

435
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,490
Well, they-- they make good candy bars.

436
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:39,780
I don't like candy bars.

437
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,640
I love pancakes.

438
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,680
Well, they make those, too.

439
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,070
I brought you here because...

440
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:59,800
I thought this place would provide a challenge for your abilities.

441
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,110
But I realized I really brought you here

442
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:06,350
because I thought you needed me.

443
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:23,350
This is a now signed letter of recommendation.

444
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:25,960
But...

445
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,780
I don't want you to go.

446
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,420
If you stay, I'll-- I'll back off. I'll...

447
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:39,990
I'll let you make your own choices, your own mistakes.

448
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:01,020
I believe in you, Shaun.

449
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:16,020
Their blood pressure dropped.

450
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:19,830
5 millimeters of Mercury.

451
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:22,300
I like when you say "Their."

452
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,040
You're gonna see some fluctuation.

453
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:27,320
BP drops 5 millimeters every complete cardiac circulation.

454
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:30,250
Shouldn't the fluctuation be inconsistent?

455
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:31,720
Maybe Katie's heart isn't picking up

456
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,630
the workload for Jenny as expected.

457
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:34,960
Jenny.

458
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,540
Jenny.

459
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:50,700
I'm-- I'm right h-here, Katie.

460
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:54,030
Right next to you.

461
00:29:54,300 --> 00:30:00,000
BGM: Break Apart by Bonobo (feat. Rhye)

462
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:57,870
* It's hard to take all of this hate *

463
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:02,190
* It's hard to take all of this *

464
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:02,310
Take Murphy and get a shotgun work-up on Katie.

465
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:04,900
I want everything -- EKG, EEG, and labs,

466
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,540
and an echo on Jenny.

467
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:13,940
* This hate *

468
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,760
Katie has an awake alpha rhythm on her EEG.

469
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,880
She's doing remarkably well.

470
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,140
We're still not entirely sure

471
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:37,110
what caused Katie to regain consciousness.

472
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:38,320
Attaching them again could

473
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,560
have redistributed fluid into Jenny's system,

474
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,950
possibly decreasing the swelling in Katie's brain.

475
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:44,240
Just don't know.

476
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:46,580
I know.

477
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:51,360
They need each other. They always have.

478
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:56,800
The issue right now has become Jenny and her heart.

479
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:58,170
When Katie was in a coma,

480
00:30:58,170 --> 00:31:00,000
the metabolic demand on her heart was very low,

481
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,460
but now that she's alert and active,

482
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,610
there just isn't enough heart for both of them.

483
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:04,890
What does that mean?

484
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:07,080
We're awaiting test results.

485
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:10,710
We're not sure how long Katie's heart

486
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:13,300
can tolerate the strain of supporting Jenny's circulation.

487
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,600
We'll closely monitor them with

488
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,490
cardiac labs and echoes.

489
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,320
We need to find a donor heart for Jenny as soon as possible.

490
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:27,960
No.

491
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:28,910
"No"?

492
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:32,170
I've had CEOs settle for half of what I just got for you.

493
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,640
I don't care about the money.

494
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:36,580
That's beautiful. It's admirable, even.

495
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:38,050
But, you see, this is how it works

496
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:40,030
because we live in a civilized society --

497
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,120
they hurt you,

498
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:44,520
we hurt them by making them cut you a massive check.

499
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,800
I don't want them to hurt.

500
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,290
I want them to give me my job back.

501
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:49,500
A third of "Your job back" Is,

502
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:52,390
by my calculation, uh, almost nothing.

503
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,350
I'll pay you - a third of this settlement.

504
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,810
What are you talking about?

505
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:02,380
You'll be paying me more than you earn in a year.

506
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,790
I want my job back.

507
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,130
Lunch is on you.

508
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,160
Lunch is on me.

509
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,410
Are you moving to Pennsylvania to be with Lea?

510
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,770
Does she know that?

511
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:27,210
Lea knows I'm moving to Hershey.

512
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:30,470
Yeah, but does she know you're going there

513
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:32,210
because she is going there?

514
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:33,310
I'm not.

515
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:40,820
Lea makes me happy.

516
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:48,170
Well, Lea's not the only one that can do that.

517
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:53,900
I'm gonna miss you.

518
00:32:57,990 --> 00:32:59,320
Your BNP.

519
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:03,810
Jenny Kunkler's - cardio protein levels are...

520
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:05,710
I've never seen anything like it.

521
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:10,300
That's because the levels are for two hearts, not one.

522
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:12,330
Now Jenny is killing Katie!

523
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:18,060
- What's going on? - We got to separate them now

524
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,810
- or we're gonna lose them both. - We got the twins on the way?

525
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:20,840
In transit.

526
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:28,100
J.L.'s gonna do a local on the fly.

527
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:32,680
On my count. Three, two, one.

528
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:38,600
We can't do this. You'll die.

529
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:40,330
We're gonna do it.

530
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:41,260
No.

531
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:43,490
We're in this together.

532
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,790
The way we've always been.

533
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,450
The way we were meant to be.

534
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:56,320
It's Jenny! She's in v-fib!

535
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,830
Push a milligram epinephrine now!

536
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:59,020
Prepping Ambu bag.

537
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,130
Murphy, start chest compressions!

538
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,250
It's Jenny.

539
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,730
Her heart had nothing left to give.

540
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,060
Katie?

541
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,640
She's stable.

542
00:34:50,410 --> 00:34:52,070
Her vitals are good,

543
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:55,180
but we have an issue that we need your help with.

544
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,530
Okay.

545
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,840
Katie won't allow us to separate her from Jenny.

546
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:05,170
If she doesn't acquiesce, Katie will clot and die.

547
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:09,920
Bring 10,000 units on board.

548
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:21,490
We'll clear out - and give you some privacy.

549
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,230
Baby.

550
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,760
We have to let her go.

551
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,320
I won't let them separate us.

552
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:46,400
I never wanted to do this.

553
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:51,600
You used to say we were made this way for a reason.

554
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,630
I won't let them do this.

555
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:59,180
Even if it kills me.

556
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:04,390
I want you to look at your sister.

557
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:07,370
Look at her.

558
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:23,310
I can't lose both of my daughters.

559
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:48,240
Dr. Andrews. Evening.

560
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:50,480
I, uh, checked out the twins' file.

561
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:51,880
It's an amazing case.

562
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,830
To be clear, Jared,

563
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:53,870
I don't want you here.

564
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:58,570
What we presented - to Miss Preston was the truth.

565
00:36:58,570 --> 00:36:59,960
I understand that.

566
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:04,370
And those problem doctors and the ways we police ourselves will be dealt with,

567
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:05,890
should have been dealt with a long time ago,

568
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,160
but you stepped over a line.

569
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,230
I fought for my job.

570
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:10,600
You compromised your integrity.

571
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:14,250
The incident with that jerk coyle had nothing to do

572
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:15,000
with black or white,

573
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,230
but that's what you and your lawyer sold for leverage.

574
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:20,840
And when you misrepresent racism for something it's not...

575
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:26,420
...it sets us two steps back.

576
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,540
She's ready.

577
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:43,800
Jared, you're on suction.

578
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:51,580
Mayos.

579
00:37:54,420 --> 00:38:00,000
BGM: Someone To Stay by Vancouver Sleep Clinic

580
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:56,630
* You were alone *

581
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:59,070
* Left out in the cold *

582
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:03,510
* Clinging to the ruin of your broken home *

583
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,330
I'm cold.

584
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:05,710
* Too lost and hurting *

585
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:08,060
* To carry your load *

586
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:12,080
* We all need someone to hold *

587
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:25,580
* You've been fighting the memory all on your own *

588
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:24,850
Gone fishing.

589
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:30,000
* Nothing worsens, nothing grows *

590
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,650
Store's closed.

591
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,990
I spoke to Claire.

592
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,450
* I know how it feels being by yourself in the rain *

593
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:38,970
* We all need someone to stay *

594
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:47,160
* We all need someone to stay *

595
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:51,350
* Hear you, falling and lonely, cry out *

596
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,910
* Will you fix me up? *

597
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:56,390
* Will you show me hope? *

598
00:38:56,390 --> 00:39:00,280
* At the end of the day, you were helpless *

599
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,680
* Can you keep me close? *

600
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:05,810
* Can you love me most? *

601
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:09,150
I want to break up.

602
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:14,770
Why?

603
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:18,920
Because I love you.

604
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:22,540
Odd reason to break up with somebody.

605
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:25,310
I want you to have everything in your life.

606
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:29,700
Which includes kids.

607
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:33,050
I told you - I was willing to not have kids.

608
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:36,120
You're gonna regret that decision one day.

609
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,520
- I won't. - Yes, you will.

610
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:41,690
You're just too decent to think it, but you will.

611
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:43,640
So what?

612
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:45,580
We all have regrets.

613
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:48,050
I-I wanted to play third base for the Astros.

614
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:50,140
It's not the same. That is a child's dream.

615
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:51,360
This is your life!

616
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,020
This is my life,

617
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:55,870
and it'd be more devastating to be resented by you

618
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,890
than to have my heart broken.

619
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:07,530
And you are going to be a great dad.

620
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:22,680
Shaun.

621
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:25,910
I wanted to give you something.

622
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:32,880
I'm letting you borrow it.

623
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,520
Bring it when you come visit?

624
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:37,860
Okay.

625
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,950
Promise?

626
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:42,140
You're gonna come visit, right?

627
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,690
I promise. I like Hershey.

628
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:47,930
- You've never been to Hershey. - Lea's there.

629
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:57,170
Can I put my arms around you?

630
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,640
Are you a good doctor?

631
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,420
'Cause when I think of you,

632
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:19,410
I think you are.

633
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,370
* You were alone *

634
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:23,930
* Left out in the cold *

635
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:28,220
* Clinging to the ruin of your broken heart *

636
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:32,070
* You were falling and lonely, cry out *

637
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:34,570
* Will you fix me up? *

638
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:37,020
* Will you show me hope? *

639
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:41,090
* At the end of the day, you were helpless *

640
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:43,430
* Can you keep me close? *

641
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,820
Remember, I said borrow.

642
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:45,390
* Can you love me? *

643
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:50,450
* I know how it feels being by yourself in the rain *

644
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:55,250
* We all need someone to stay *

645
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:03,360
* We all need someone to stay *

646
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:07,500
* Hear you, falling and lonely, cry out *

647
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,760
* Will you fix me up? *

648
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,360
* Will you show me hope? *

649
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:16,290
* At the end of the day, you were helpless *

650
00:42:16,290 --> 00:42:18,680
* Can you keep me close? *

651
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:21,570
* Can you love me most? *
