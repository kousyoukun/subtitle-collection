00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,550
我家人喜欢教堂\NMy family likes churches.

233
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:10,230
我们确实应该晚点谈谈\NWe should talk about this later.

234
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,930
利姆医生  你有一位黄标患者要变成红标了\NDr. Lim, I think one of your yellows is about to turn red.

235
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:18,930
我把婚礼都策划好了\NI've got my wedding all planned out.

236
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:21,240
婚纱和鲜花都选好了\NI've got the dress, and I've got the flowers.

237
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,970
来个新郎就万事大吉了\NAll I need is a groom.

238
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,050
你愿意吗  莫菲医生\NYou available, Dr. Murphy?

239
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:27,460
不\NNo.

240
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,380
你不想要爱吗\NYou don't want some love?

241
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:33,310
不  我不想  我不想要\NNo. No, I don't. I don't want love.

242
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:39,960
格拉斯曼医生  神经会诊  三区\NDr. Glassman, neural consult, Bay Three.

243
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:41,000
谢谢你\NThank you.

244
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,030
我先到的\NI was here first.

245
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:49,160
肖恩\NShaun.

246
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,340
肖恩\NShaun!

247
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:53,560
我患者的片子很重要\NMy patient's scans are very important.

248
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,010
我患者的也很重要\NWell, my patient's important, too.

249
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:57,270
我得看看我患者的片子\NI need to see my patient's scans.

250
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,780
你的患者是术前还是术后\NIs your patient pre-op or post-op?

251
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,590
术前\NPre-op.

252
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:03,830
好吧  我把电脑让给你\NOkay, I'll give you the computer,

253
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,240
但你得先道歉才行\Nbut you need to apologize first.

254
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,160
好吧  对不起  快打开\NOkay, I'm sorry. Turn it on.

255
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:16,020
为什么梅伦德斯医生告诉马尔科的亲属\NWhy was Marco's family crying when Dr. Melendez

256
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,290
他需要截肢时  他们要哭\Ntold them his leg would need to be amputated?

257
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:23,190
他们儿子的腿要被截下去了\NWell, their son's leg is about to be cut off.

258
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:25,740
这很悲伤  哭泣很正常\NIt's sad. Crying is normal.

259
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,400
但在截肢和死亡之间选择的话\NBut when your options are amputation or death,

260
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,110
截肢不是更好吗\Namputation is good news.

261
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:32,960
人们需要时间消化这种巨变\NPeople need time to adjust to big changes.

262
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:36,320
马尔科的家人甚至没机会奢求奇迹\NMarco's family didn't even get a chance to pray for a miracle.

263
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,070
这没可能\NIt's not possible.

264
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,910
骨头受损太严重\NThe bone damage is too severe.

265
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,580
无法进行杆移植\NA rod implantation won't work.

266
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,760
没有可供固定的地方\NThere's nothing to anchor into,

267
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:59,230
并且分流器持续不到重建的时候\Nand the shunt won't last long enough to do reconstruction.

268
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:02,930
没有其他选择了\NThere are no other options.

269
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,150
也许我们能更换整个股骨\NWhat if we could replace the entire femur?

270
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,380
我们在给他造一根新的股骨\NWe're making him a new femur.

271
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:16,050
用3D打印机吗\NWith a 3D printer?

272
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:20,180
3D打印骨骼只成功应用于下颌处过\N3D-printed bones have only successfully been done with the mandible.

273
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,150
我们知道\NWe know.

274
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,230
-那是个非常小的骨头  -我们知道\N- That's a fairly small bone. - We know.

275
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:25,350
股骨需要支撑全身的重量\NA femur has to support the weight of the entire body.

276
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:27,830
所以我们用钛合金来打造这根  没问题的\NThis one will be titanium. It can work.

277
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:29,210
这个想法很有趣\NIt's an interesting idea...

278
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:32,070
但我仍需考虑一下\Nbut I need to think on it.

279
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:35,090
现在还有七位黄标患者等待救治呢\NRight now we still got seven yellow tags waiting.

280
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,310
还有什么需要考虑的\NWhat do you have to think about?

281
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:38,080
-这是个好主意  -非常棒的主意\N- It's a good idea. - It's a brilliant idea.

282
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,440
那孩子很有想法  但并不意味着...\NThe kid has brilliant ideas. That doesn't mean --

283
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,770
不  这是我的主意\NNo, it was my idea,

284
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:41,970
我也清楚其中的风险\Nand I'm aware of the risks --

285
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:44,040
感染  凝血  身体机能受损\Ninfection, clotting, hardware failure...

286
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:44,800
死亡\NDeath.

287
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:47,190
-这不是你的主意  -就是我的主意\N- It wasn't your idea. - It was my idea!

288
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:48,720
风险确实很大\NAnd the risks are significant,

289
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,030
但应由他们决定啊\Nbut isn't that their call?

290
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,980
-我们需要... -也许他说了什么\N- Don't we have to... - Maybe he said something,

291
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,320
你接着说了什么  之后你们一起...\Nand then you said something, and together, you --

292
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:55,280
我的主意  完全是我的主意\NMy idea. Completely my idea.

293
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,260
这个「非常棒」的想法完全来自于我\NThe "brilliant" idea is 100% my brilliant idea.

294
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,740
为什么你不能接受呢\NWhy is that a problem for you?

295
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:02,040
也许因为我们相识六个月了\NMaybe because I've known you for six months.

296
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,880
我们每天都能学到新东西\NEvery day we learn new things.

297
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,680
今天你会发现我很聪明\NToday, you learned I'm brilliant.

298
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,420
是这个想法很棒\NThe idea was brilliant.

299
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,410
而这想法是我的\NAnd it was mine.

300
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:12,050
如果有谁能完成这个无与伦比的手术\NAnd if anyone can do this brilliant surgery,

301
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:12,670
那非你莫属\Nit's you.

302
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:15,330
恭维\NFlattery --

303
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,590
也很棒\Nalso brilliant.

304
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,570
工作时间睡觉\NSleeping on the job?

305
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,080
只是出来透透气\NJust needed some fresh air.

306
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:32,280
待在里面快要窒息了\NFeels like I'm suffocating in there.

307
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:36,570
她很痛苦  痛得天翻地覆\NShe's in pain, spilling her guts out,

308
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:37,890
每次我说点什么\Nand every time I open my mouth,

309
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:38,980
听起来都像个笨蛋\NI sound like an idiot.

310
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,780
卡卢医生  没法和女性交流\NDr. Kalu -- unable to talk to women.

311
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:43,920
这可真新鲜\NThere's a first.

312
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,980
你要是不帮我  克莱尔  就让我自己待会\NIf you're not gonna be helpful, Claire, just leave.

313
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:51,720
你不用和她交谈  用心倾听就好了\NYou don't need to talk. Just listen to her.

314
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:55,800
你可以出来透气  理清头绪\NYou get to come out here, clear your head.

315
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:56,880
她却被困在里面\NShe's trapped in there,

316
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,880
和她的思绪  恐惧为伴\Nalone with her thoughts, her fears.

317
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:00,440
你以为她不想出来透气吗\NYou don't think she wants to get out?

318
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,760
你是她的救赎\NYou are her escape.

319
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,830
你想在马尔科的腿上安一块假的股骨\NYou want to put a fake femur into Marco's leg?

320
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:15,770
不是假的  是真的\NIt's not fake. It's real.

321
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:18,330
不算真正的骨头  我们打算用钛合金来制作\NIt's not a real bone. We're making it out of titanium.

322
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:19,260
还是真的\NIt's still real.

323
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,450
真是太不可思议了\NThat's incredible.

324
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,400
之后马尔科就可以走路跑步甚至爬山了吗\NAnd Marco will be able to walk, run, climb?

325
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,560
还能游泳呢\NAnd swim.

326
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:27,700
希望如此  这是我们的手术目的\NHopefully. That's the intention.

327
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:30,240
你们之前做过类似的手术吗\NWell, have you done the surgery before?

328
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,810
-我没有  -我们将是首例\N- I haven't. - We'll be the first.

329
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:35,940
之前没有人用股骨这样大的骨头\NWell, nobody has ever attempted this surgery

330
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,860
来尝试过此类手术\Nwith a bone as large as the femur.

331
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,680
我相信此方案可行  但也存在风险\NI believe it's a viable option, but there are risks.

332
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,170
风险  马尔科会死吗\NRisks? Could Marco die?

333
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:46,080
据我估计  他有10%的可能性撑不过手术\NIn my estimation, there's a 10% chance he won't make it.

334
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:46,940
那就不做\NThen no.

335
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,550
我不能失去儿子\NI'm not losing my son.

336
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:51,410
等等  如果我们有可能拯救马尔科的腿\NWait. If there's a chance we can save Marco's leg,

337
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:52,870
我们应该至少再详细讨论一下\Nwe should at least discuss this some more.

338
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,040
这是他所希望的\NThat's what he'd want.

339
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,420
他想活着\NHe'd want to live.

340
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:56,990
他想保住性命\NHe'd want to have a life.

341
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,680
我了解他\NI know him.

00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:00,820
他会想要抓住机会\NHe'd want to take the chance.

343
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,140
如果因为我做的鲁莽决定而害死马尔科\NI will never forgive myself if Marco died

344
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,040
我将永远不会原谅自己\Nbecause I made a reckless decision.

345
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,150
该由谁来做决定\NWhose decision is this?

346
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:09,730
他有医疗决策委托人吗\NDoes he have a healthcare proxy?

347
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,360
那是什么\NI don't know what that is.

348
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,340
发生事故时\NWhen the accident happened,

00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,230
你们是正去往婚礼还是从婚礼回来\Nwere you on the way to your wedding or on the way back?

我们在去婚礼的路上\NWe were headed to the wedding.

那么马尔科的父母是最近的亲属\NMarco's parents are the next of kin.

352

由他们决定\NThey decide.

给我儿子截肢吧\Namputate our son's leg.

莫菲\NMurphy.

356
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,870
为什么截肢手术中断端的缝合至关重要\NWhy is the primary closure on the stump so vital in amputation surgery?

为了得以装配假肢\NFor a proper prosthetic fitting.

358

为什么你要和杰西卡结婚\NWhy are you marrying Jessica?

我不明白为什么对人们来说\NI don't understand why having someone to love

363
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:05,580
拥有挚爱那么重要\Nis so important to everyone.

364
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,840
你们得停止手术\NYou have to stand down.

366
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,620
我申请了紧急禁制令来阻止手术\NI filed an emergency injunction to stop the surgery.

367
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,010
你发生了车祸\NYou were in a car accident.

你的脖子受伤了\NYour neck was punctured.

再有一周留院观察\NYou're gonna have to stay put for a week
