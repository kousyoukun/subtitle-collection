当我们一起开会时
When we're in meetings together,

4

别再说我的想法很荒谬

9
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,840
一个外科医生需要懂得沟通  莫菲医生能做到吗
A surgeon needs to communicate. Can Dr. Murphy do that?

10
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:17,920
重压之下他能行吗
Can he do that under stress?

11
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,450
明知别人命悬一线时
Can he do that knowing that a human life

12
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:22,230
他能做到吗
literally hangs in the balance?

那在这死定了

20
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,850
所以才叫「销魂大夜班」
That's why they call it the graveyard shift.

21
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:46,740
我称这为「天堂」  你们是我要带的创伤新人吗

事没忙完  谁都不准回家

Ballsy.

140
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,200
可能会惹出大麻烦
Could've gone really wrong.

141
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,930
对  但并没有
Yes, well, it didn't.

142
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,390
相当冒险
It's a cowboy move --

143
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:58,320
是你做梦都不敢尝试做的事
something you would never even dream of trying.

144
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,480
肖恩还要证明自己多少次
How many times is Shaun gonna have to prove himself

145
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,970
你才愿意给他机会
before you give him a shot?

146
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,450
洛林戴斯医生  请前往六号手术室
Dr. Rolendez, O.R. 6.

147
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,300
急诊室里怎么回事
What happened in the E.R.?

148
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:16,730
天鹅女孩进来时你犹豫了
Swan girl came in and you hesitated.

149
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:19,050
我没有犹豫  我在想救助计划
I wasn't hesitating. I was thinking of a game plan.

150
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:21,070
莫菲是在想救助计划
Murphy was thinking of the game plan.

151
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,430
你是不知所措了
You got overwhelmed.

152
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:23,930
我没有
I wasn't.

153
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:25,870
初次急救  会这样的
First trauma, it happens.

154
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,890
你需要有条不紊并清晰迅速地思考
You have to think clearly, quickly, methodically.

155
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,860
你可以学学肖恩的思考方式
You need to think a little more like Shaun.

156
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:35,320
稍微学习一下  不要完全照搬
A little more. Not identically.

157
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,870
你怎么样
How you doing?

158
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:55,580
抱歉
Sorry.

159
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,470
抱歉  这是个蠢问题
Sorry. That's a stupid question.

160
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:03,710
你体内的吗啡已被消耗完毕
You're maxed out on morphine.

161
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,770
我等吗啡重新起作用后再继续
I'll hold off until it reloads.

162
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,260
情况有多糟糕
How bad is it?

163
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,690
现在进展不错
We're making good progress.

164
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,090
我需要清除所有破溃的水疱
I'll have to... debride any deroofed blisters

165
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:19,530
避免二次感染...
to prevent a secondary nosocomial and then --

166
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:20,590
给我镜子
I need a mirror.

167
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,300
既然你都不敢看我的眼睛
It's the least you can do

168
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,340
至少能把镜子拿给我吧
since you can't even look me in the eye.

169
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,290
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

170
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:56,420
你知道这两年内我买了多少
Do you know how many hideous $300 bridesmaid dresses

171
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,750
丑陋的伴娘礼服吗
I've had to buy in the last two years?

172
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:03,430
我决定等自己结婚时
I decided that when I got married,

173
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,670
要让伴娘们穿小黑裙
my bridesmaids are gonna wear black cocktail dresses

174
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:09,200
这样她们就能重复穿了
so they can use them again, you know?

175
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,140
但现在...
But now...

176
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,010
我就像是《猛鬼街》中的恶魔
now I-I'm Freddy Krueger.

177
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,160
谁还愿意娶我呢
Who's gonna want to marry this?

178
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:28,160
我去找护士
I'm gonna find a nurse,

179
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,800
让她帮你调节一下吗啡的滴速
have her adjust your... your morphine drip.

180
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:37,850
好了
Okay.

181
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,370
你的脸被撞到了
You hit your face.

182
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,030
下巴脱臼  很疼
Your jaw got stuck. It hurts.

183
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:43,020
刚才给你打的针会让你晕过去
So, this shot I just gave you is gonna knock you out

184
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,110
好让我治好你的下巴
so that I can fix that.

185
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:44,960
请稍等
Hang tight.

186
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:47,640
-车祸患者状态分级确认了吗  -共有23人
- Crash patients status check? - 23 people total.

187
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,830
现场死亡一人  急诊室死亡一人
One fatality on site, lost one in the E.R.

188
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:50,730
红标患者全部经过检查
Examined all the red tags.

189
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,910
候诊室还有十三位黄标以及绿标患者
Got 13 yellow and green still in the waiting room.

190
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:55,360
-我负责下位患者  -马尔科·麦哲伦
- I'll take whoever's up next. - Marco Magallenes...

191
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,180
股动脉断裂  股骨粉碎
severed femoral artery, crushed femur.

192
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:00,310
我做了REBOA  并安装了临时分流器
I did the REBOA and then installed a temporary shunt.

193
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:03,040
这是他的CT和核磁共振结果
Here are his CT and MRI results.

194
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:09,500
找别人负责下位患者
Find someone else for whoever's up next.

195
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:13,340
终于安静了
Oh, finally.

196
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,520
打扰一下  你们是马尔科的亲属吗
Excuse me. Are you Marco's family?

197
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,270
是的
Yes.

198
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:38,270
我们刚知道我表亲没在事故中幸免于难
We just found out that my cousin didn't survive the accident.

199
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,320
请节哀
I'm sorry.

200
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,490
-有点吃不消  -我很遗憾
- It's a bit much. - I'm so sorry.

201
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:46,280
我是梅伦德斯医生  这位是莫菲医生
I'm Dr. Melendez, and this is Dr. Murphy.

202
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,910
我是里尔卡多
I'm Ricardo.

203
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,830
我是马尔科的父亲
I'm M-Marco's father.

204
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:53,440
这是他母亲蕾娜  这是索尼娅
This is, uh, his mother, Lorena, and this is Sonia.

205
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:55,590
他们今晚要结婚了
They were getting married tonight.

206
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,200
我儿子怎么样
How's my son?

207
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,140
马尔科的股骨彻底粉碎
Marco's femur was completely shattered,

208
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,410
小腿供血不足
and his lower leg isn't getting enough blood.

209
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,270
你能救下他的腿吗
Can you save his leg?

210
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:06,990
马尔科股骨粉碎太过严重
Marco suffered too much bone fragmentation.

211
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,450
我们治不好了
We can't fix it.

212
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,360
截肢是唯一的选择
Our only choice is to amputate.

213
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,900
女儿
Mija.

214
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,910
五区需要三级前房积血检查
Bay Five needs a grade three hyphema.

215
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:32,400
头部CT和眼科表单吗
Head CT and page ophthalmology?

216
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,490
你真懂我
You read my mind.

217
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:34,470
有一阵了
Been a while.

218
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:36,640
通宵加班还撑得住吗
How you holding up pulling an all-nighter?

219
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,300
还凑合  但你要是能给我来点静脉注射咖啡因
I'll manage, but if you can find me a caffeine IV,

220
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,870
-借过  -就更好了
- Please move! - it'd be helpful.

221
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,040
-今晚真辛苦  -是啊
- Tough night. - Yeah.

222
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,020
谢谢你过来
Thanks for coming.

223
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:47,270
这是工作的一部分
It's part of the job.

224
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,860
大喜日子定了吗
So, when's the big day?

225
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,040
我们还没定呢
We haven't set it yet.

226
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,880
在哪儿举行婚礼
Oh, where is it gonna be?

227
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:56,510
我们会再商量的
We'll figure it out.

228
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,620
也许在某处的沙滩上
Maybe a beach somewhere.

229
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:00,070
我们应该晚点再谈
We should talk about this later.

230
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,710
怎么了  我喜欢沙滩
What? I like beaches.

231
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:03,690
如果你有更浪漫的想法...
If you have a more romantic idea...

232
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,550
我家人喜欢教堂
My family likes churches.

233
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:10,230
我们确实应该晚点谈谈
We should talk about this later.

234
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,930
利姆医生  你有一位黄标患者要变成红标了
Dr. Lim, I think one of your yellows is about to turn red.

235
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:18,930
我把婚礼都策划好了
I've got my wedding all planned out.

236
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:21,240
婚纱和鲜花都选好了
I've got the dress, and I've got the flowers.

237
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,970
来个新郎就万事大吉了
All I need is a groom.

238
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,050
你愿意吗  莫菲医生
You available, Dr. Murphy?

239
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:27,460
不
No.

240
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,380
你不想要爱吗
You don't want some love?

241
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:33,310
不  我不想  我不想要
No. No, I don't. I don't want love.

242
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:39,960
格拉斯曼医生  神经会诊  三区
Dr. Glassman, neural consult, Bay Three.

243
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:41,000
谢谢你
Thank you.

244
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,030
我先到的
I was here first.

245
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:49,160
肖恩
Shaun.

246
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,340
肖恩
Shaun!

247
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:53,560
我患者的片子很重要
My patient's scans are very important.

248
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,010
我患者的也很重要
Well, my patient's important, too.

249
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:57,270
我得看看我患者的片子
I need to see my patient's scans.

250
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,780
你的患者是术前还是术后
Is your patient pre-op or post-op?

251
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,590
术前
Pre-op.

252
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:03,830
好吧  我把电脑让给你
Okay, I'll give you the computer,

253
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,240
但你得先道歉才行
but you need to apologize first.

254
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,160
好吧  对不起  快打开
Okay, I'm sorry. Turn it on.

255
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:16,020
为什么梅伦德斯医生告诉马尔科的亲属
Why was Marco's family crying when Dr. Melendez

256
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,290
他需要截肢时  他们要哭
told them his leg would need to be amputated?

257
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:23,190
他们儿子的腿要被截下去了
Well, their son's leg is about to be cut off.

258
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:25,740
这很悲伤  哭泣很正常
It's sad. Crying is normal.

259
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,400
但在截肢和死亡之间选择的话
But when your options are amputation or death,

260
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,110
截肢不是更好吗
amputation is good news.

261
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:32,960
人们需要时间消化这种巨变
People need time to adjust to big changes.

262
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:36,320
马尔科的家人甚至没机会奢求奇迹
Marco's family didn't even get a chance to pray for a miracle.

263
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,070
这没可能
It's not possible.

264
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,910
骨头受损太严重
The bone damage is too severe.

265
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,580
无法进行杆移植
A rod implantation won't work.

266
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,760
没有可供固定的地方
There's nothing to anchor into,

267
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:59,230
并且分流器持续不到重建的时候
and the shunt won't last long enough to do reconstruction.

268
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:02,930
没有其他选择了
There are no other options.

269
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,150
也许我们能更换整个股骨
What if we could replace the entire femur?

270
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,380
我们在给他造一根新的股骨
We're making him a new femur.

271
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:16,050
用3D打印机吗
With a 3D printer?

272
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:20,180
3D打印骨骼只成功应用于下颌处过
3D-printed bones have only successfully been done with the mandible.

273
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,150
我们知道
We know.

274
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,230
-那是个非常小的骨头  -我们知道
- That's a fairly small bone. - We know.

275
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:25,350
股骨需要支撑全身的重量
A femur has to support the weight of the entire body.

276
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:27,830
所以我们用钛合金来打造这根  没问题的
This one will be titanium. It can work.

277
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:29,210
这个想法很有趣
It's an interesting idea...

278
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:32,070
但我仍需考虑一下
but I need to think on it.

279
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:35,090
现在还有七位黄标患者等待救治呢
Right now we still got seven yellow tags waiting.

280
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,310
还有什么需要考虑的
What do you have to think about?

281
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:38,080
-这是个好主意  -非常棒的主意
- It's a good idea. - It's a brilliant idea.

282
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,440
那孩子很有想法  但并不意味着...
The kid has brilliant ideas. That doesn't mean --

283
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,770
不  这是我的主意
No, it was my idea,

284
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:41,970
我也清楚其中的风险
and I'm aware of the risks --

285
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:44,040
感染  凝血  身体机能受损
infection, clotting, hardware failure...

286
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:44,800
死亡
Death.

287
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:47,190
-这不是你的主意  -就是我的主意
- It wasn't your idea. - It was my idea!

288
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:48,720
风险确实很大
And the risks are significant,

289
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,030
但应由他们决定啊
but isn't that their call?

290
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,980
-我们需要... -也许他说了什么
- Don't we have to... - Maybe he said something,

291
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,320
你接着说了什么  之后你们一起...
and then you said something, and together, you --

292
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:55,280
我的主意  完全是我的主意
My idea. Completely my idea.

293
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,260
这个「非常棒」的想法完全来自于我
The "brilliant" idea is 100% my brilliant idea.

294
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,740
为什么你不能接受呢
Why is that a problem for you?

295
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:02,040
也许因为我们相识六个月了
Maybe because I've known you for six months.

296
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,880
我们每天都能学到新东西
Every day we learn new things.

297
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,680
今天你会发现我很聪明
Today, you learned I'm brilliant.

298
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,420
是这个想法很棒
The idea was brilliant.

299
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,410
而这想法是我的
And it was mine.

300
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:12,050
如果有谁能完成这个无与伦比的手术
And if anyone can do this brilliant surgery,

301
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:12,670
那非你莫属
it's you.

302
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:15,330
恭维
Flattery --

303
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,590
也很棒
also brilliant.

304
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,570
工作时间睡觉
Sleeping on the job?

305
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,080
只是出来透透气
Just needed some fresh air.

306
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:32,280
待在里面快要窒息了
Feels like I'm suffocating in there.

307
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:36,570
她很痛苦  痛得天翻地覆
She's in pain, spilling her guts out,

308
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:37,890
每次我说点什么
and every time I open my mouth,

309
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:38,980
听起来都像个笨蛋
I sound like an idiot.

310
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,780
卡卢医生  没法和女性交流
Dr. Kalu -- unable to talk to women.

311
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:43,920
这可真新鲜
There's a first.

312
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,980
你要是不帮我  克莱尔  就让我自己待会
If you're not gonna be helpful, Claire, just leave.

313
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:51,720
你不用和她交谈  用心倾听就好了
You don't need to talk. Just listen to her.

314
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:55,800
你可以出来透气  理清头绪
You get to come out here, clear your head.

315
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:56,880
她却被困在里面
She's trapped in there,

316
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,880
和她的思绪  恐惧为伴
alone with her thoughts, her fears.

317
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:00,440
你以为她不想出来透气吗
You don't think she wants to get out?

318
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,760
你是她的救赎
You are her escape.

319
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,830
你想在马尔科的腿上安一块假的股骨
You want to put a fake femur into Marco's leg?

320
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:15,770
不是假的  是真的
It's not fake. It's real.

321
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:18,330
不算真正的骨头  我们打算用钛合金来制作
It's not a real bone. We're making it out of titanium.

322
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:19,260
还是真的
It's still real.

323
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,450
真是太不可思议了
That's incredible.

324
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,400
之后马尔科就可以走路跑步甚至爬山了吗
And Marco will be able to walk, run, climb?

325
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,560
还能游泳呢
And swim.

326
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:27,700
希望如此  这是我们的手术目的
Hopefully. That's the intention.

327
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:30,240
你们之前做过类似的手术吗
Well, have you done the surgery before?

328
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,810
-我没有  -我们将是首例
- I haven't. - We'll be the first.

329
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:35,940
之前没有人用股骨这样大的骨头
Well, nobody has ever attempted this surgery

330
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,860
来尝试过此类手术
with a bone as large as the femur.

331
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,680
我相信此方案可行  但也存在风险
I believe it's a viable option, but there are risks.

332
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,170
风险  马尔科会死吗
Risks? Could Marco die?

333
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:46,080
据我估计  他有10%的可能性撑不过手术
In my estimation, there's a 10% chance he won't make it.

334
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:46,940
那就不做
Then no.

335
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,550
我不能失去儿子
I'm not losing my son.

336
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:51,410
等等  如果我们有可能拯救马尔科的腿
Wait. If there's a chance we can save Marco's leg,

337
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:52,870
我们应该至少再详细讨论一下
we should at least discuss this some more.

338
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,040
这是他所希望的
That's what he'd want.

339
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,420
他想活着
He'd want to live.

340
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:56,990
他想保住性命
He'd want to have a life.

341
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,680
我了解他
I know him.

342
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:00,820
他会想要抓住机会
He'd want to take the chance.

343
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,140
如果因为我做的鲁莽决定而害死马尔科
I will never forgive myself if Marco died

344
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,040
我将永远不会原谅自己
because I made a reckless decision.

345
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,150
该由谁来做决定
Whose decision is this?

346
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:09,730
他有医疗决策委托人吗
Does he have a healthcare proxy?

347
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,360
那是什么
I don't know what that is.

348
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,340
发生事故时
When the accident happened,

349
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,230
你们是正去往婚礼还是从婚礼回来
were you on the way to your wedding or on the way back?

350
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,880
我们在去婚礼的路上
We were headed to the wedding.

351
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,830
那么马尔科的父母是最近的亲属
Marco's parents are the next of kin.

352
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,060
由他们决定
They decide.

353
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:28,390
求你
Please...

354
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:31,290
给我儿子截肢吧
amputate our son's leg.

355
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:36,900
莫菲
Murphy.

356
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,870
为什么截肢手术中断端的缝合至关重要
Why is the primary closure on the stump so vital in amputation surgery?

357
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:49,570
为了得以装配假肢
For a proper prosthetic fitting.

358
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,070
为什么你要和杰西卡结婚
Why are you marrying Jessica?

359
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:55,370
为什么任何人要结婚
Why does anyone get married?

360
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,360
我不知道
I don't know.

361
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,500
我爱她
I love her.

362
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:03,880
我不明白为什么对人们来说
I don't understand why having someone to love

363
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:05,580
拥有挚爱那么重要
is so important to everyone.

364
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,840
你们得停止手术
You have to stand down.

365
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,410
-你不能给马尔科截肢  -为什么
- You can't amputate Marco's leg. - Why not?

366
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,620
我申请了紧急禁制令来阻止手术
I filed an emergency injunction to stop the surgery.

367
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,010
你发生了车祸
You were in a car accident.

368
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:21,520
你的脖子受伤了
Your neck was punctured.

369
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,420
修复手术进行得很顺利
The repair surgery went well.

370
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:24,810
再有一周留院观察
You're gonna have to stay put for a week

371
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:26,170
我们才能让你出院
before we can release you.

372
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,180
你能活下来很幸运
You're very lucky to be alive.

373
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:41,820
我妻子珍娜·亨塞尔  她还好吗
My wife, Jenna Hensel -- is she okay?

374
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,120
我能见她吗
Can I see her?

375
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,370
她不在名单上
She's not listed.

376
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,480
这是好事
That's a good thing.

377
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:53,260
她可能还在候诊室
She's probably still in the waiting room.

378
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:55,100
我去找她  把她带过来
I'll find her and bring her up.

379
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:57,090
她知道你没事一定会松一口气
She'll be relieved to know you're okay.

380
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,170
好
Okay.

381
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,790
伤腿就像颗定时炸弹的昏迷患者
What the hell am I supposed to do with an unconscious patient

382
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:04,000
我应该拿他怎么办
whose leg is a ticking time bomb?

383
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,250
辛格法官在路上了
Judge Singh is en route.

384
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:08,120
她想听听父母双方以及相关医生的意见
She wants to hear from both parties and the doctors on the case.

385
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,730
我也得去作证吗
I have to testify?

386
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:10,860
-但愿不用  -但愿不用
- Hopefully not. - Hopefully not.

387
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,360
我以为你会很高兴
I thought you would be happy.

388
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,240
你觉得能拯救他的腿
You thought you could save the leg,

389
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,310
我不希望因为他的父母不敢做这个艰难的决定
and I didn't want that not happening because the parents

390
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,490
而导致手术不能进行
are afraid to make a tough call.

391
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,910
这是他们的决定
It's their call to make.

392
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:20,610
如果车祸晚一个小时发生
And if the accident happened an hour later,

393
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,120
就是他妻子做决定了
it would be the wife's.

394
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,570
而她想要安装假骨
And she wants the fake leg.

395
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:24,860
那不是假的
It's not fake.

396
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:28,980
我以为你不会盲目遵守规则
I thought you didn't believe in just blindly following protocol.

397
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,190
他是他们的儿子
He's their son.

398
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,780
没人比他们更爱他
Nobody's gonna love him more than them.

399
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:32,780
真的吗
Seriously?

400
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:35,990
所有父母都比任何人更爱自己的孩子吗
All parents love all children more than anybody else?

401
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:37,770
人们无时无刻不在离婚
People get divorced all the time.

402
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,340
他们多常会放弃自己的孩子
How often do they give up their kids?

403
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,680
所以  如果是我们
So, if this was us,

404
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,550
你更希望你的父母而不是我来替你决定吗
you'd want your parents to decide over me?

405
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:44,480
-我不是那个意思  -你就是
- I didn't say that. - You kind of did.

406
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,440
我是说  需要有规定
I was saying, there needs to be rules,

407
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:50,830
需要有明显的界限告诉我们
that there needs to be bright red lines telling us

408
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,460
谁能做这些重要决定
who gets to make these calls.

409
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,250
这是父母的决定
It's the parents' call.

410
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,220
现在不是了
Not anymore.

411
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:56,970
现在是法官的决定了
Now it's the judge's.

412
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:59,850
马尔科的临时分流还剩多少时间
How much time does Marco have left on the temporary shunt?

413
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:01,090
三小时
Three hours,

414
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:03,870
然后他的腿就彻底没救了
and then his leg will die.

415
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,560
好
Okay.

416
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,840
「折磨医生」回来了
Dr. Torture returns.

417
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:21,720
还以为我把你吓跑了
Thought I'd scared you off for good.

418
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,200
选个电影
Pick a movie.

419
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:26,410
你也应该得以离开房间出去透透气
You deserve to get out of this room for a little while, too.

420
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:32,020
你认为看《偷天情缘》能有用吗
You think "Groundhog Day" is gonna make a difference?

421
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:36,050
「我折磨你  但你可以看个搞笑电影」
"I'm torturing you, but, hey, you get to watch a funny movie."

422
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:38,520
我差不多就是这个意思
That is sort of what I was going for, yeah.

423
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,870
抱歉
I'm sorry.

424
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,790
我希望我还能做点什么
I wish there was something else I could do.

425
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:51,100
你怎么知道没有
How do you know there isn't?

426
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,720
这是规定  这是他们教给我们的东西
This is protocol. This is what they teach us.

427
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:53,880
我真是太走运了
I lucked out.

428
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,540
我这个烧伤病人遇到了世界上最好的专家
I got the world's greatest expert on burn victims?

429
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,990
你知道所有能做的事
You know everything that can be done.

430
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:07,400
他喜爱攀岩  深潜  蹦极
He loves to rock-climb, scuba dive, bungee-jump.

431
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,860
这太愚蠢了
This is insane.

432
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:12,510
我们在这里回忆时  他的腿正逐渐死去
His leg is literally dying while we sit here reminiscing.

433
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:15,630
我们正努力搞清楚你儿子真正希望的是什么
Please. We're trying to figure out what your son would want.

434
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:17,390
-他想活着  -我也希望他活着
- He would want to live. - I want that, too,

435
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:20,470
但如果有办法能救回马尔科的腿
but if there's a way that we can save Marco's leg,

436
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,470
他会希望我同意的
he'd want me to do it.

437
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:26,550
女儿  你知道他最希望什么吗
Mija, Do you know what he wanted most of all?

438
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,860
他想娶你
He wanted to marry you.

439
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:34,220
他想和你共度余生  与你生儿育女
He wanted to spend his life with you, have children with you.

440
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:36,230
他能做到这些
Now, he can do all that.

441
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:39,960
即使装上假肢他也可以很幸福
He can be happy with a prosthetic leg.

442
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,310
他还年轻  还很坚强
He's young, and he's strong.

443
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:45,950
女儿  他能度过这个难关的
Mija, he can get through this.

444
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:55,070
-我们相遇时  -我不在乎你的故事
- When we met -- - I don't care about your stories.

445
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:58,970
我不在乎你们是攀岩时
I don't care that you met rock-climbing

446
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:00,990
还是泛舟时认识的
or kayaking or whatever.

447
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:04,030
-我只希望... -我们在戒酒中心认识的
- I just want -- - We met in rehab.

448
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:15,850
珍娜·亨塞尔在吗
Hey, are either of you Jenna Hensel?

449
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:19,140
在酒店拍完照后我就没见过珍娜了
I haven't seen Jenna since we took pictures at the hotel.

450
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:20,930
但是她上了公车
But she got on the bus?

451
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:23,080
是的  她坐在内奥米旁边
Yeah, she was sitting with Noomi.

452
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:30,970
我觉得她还在那里
I think she's still out there.

453
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:33,130
-各位  我们得回去  -去哪里
- Hey, guys! We've got to go back. - Where?

454
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:34,440
去事故现场  立刻去
To the crash site. Now.

455
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,900
他不想让你知道
He never wanted you to know.

456
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,910
他是个瘾君子
He's an addict.

457
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:45,180
他从酒瘾换到了更健康的癖好
He replaced one addiction for another one -- a healthier one.

458
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:48,270
-但是他需要... -什么
- But he needs -- - What?

459
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,560
他需要去花式滑水  不然就喝死自己吗
He needs to wakeboard or he'll drink himself to death?

460
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:54,510
-这太荒谬了  -不  这没有
- This is ridiculous. - No, it's not!

461
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:56,360
我们谈过很多
We talked about it a lot.

462
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,550
在戒酒中心也只能谈话了
It's pretty much all you do in rehab.

463
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,630
马尔科在他的人生中第一次清醒
Marco has clarity for the first time in his life.

464
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,750
他知道什么让他快乐
He knows what makes him happy.

465
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,470
他知道自己的弱点
He knows his weaknesses.

466
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:08,270
他并没有你想象的那么坚强
He's not as strong as you think.

467
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:12,060
那也无妨  但是...
And that's okay, but --

468
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:13,840
马尔科出轨了
Marco cheated on you.

469
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,670
大约一个月前
It was about a month ago.

470
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:21,950
他被婚礼和策划压得喘不上气
He was overwhelmed with the wedding and the planning.

471
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,570
于是他去找了前女友
He ran into an ex-girlfriend.

472
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,330
只有那一次
It only happened once.

473
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,500
你说谎
You're lying.

474
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:33,810
你是在生气他有秘密瞒着你
You're upset that he had secrets from you, so --

475
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:35,510
不  她没有撒谎
No, she's not lying.

476
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:40,800
女儿  他非常心烦意乱
Mija, he -- he was -- he was so upset.

477
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:41,800
但他确实是爱你的
He does love you.

478
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,390
我们似乎有点偏题了
Okay, maybe we're digressing here a little bit.

479
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:45,770
我们真的没有时间了
And we really don't have the time.

480
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:47,040
这很重要
It matters.

481
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,810
她没那么了解他
She doesn't know him like --

482
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,300
可能我们也不了解  但是...
maybe none of us do, but...

483
00:23:54,650 --> 00:24:00,370
但我们是他的父母  而你还不是他的妻子
but we are his parents, and you're not his wife. Yet.

484
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,330
叫警察来  检查所有地方
Okay. Get the cops. Check everywhere --

485
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:20,310
路的另一边  灌木丛  树下
other side of the road, bushes, trees.

486
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:21,200
如果她从公车上飞了出去
If she was ejected from the bus,

487
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,160
她可能落在任何方向的12到15米之间
she could be 40, 50 feet in any direction.

488
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:28,250
珍娜
Jenna!

489
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,950
我找到她了  我需要帮助
I found her! I need some help!

490
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,650
她脑出血了
Okay, she's got a brain bleed.

491
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:43,570
我们需要立刻带她离开这里
We need to get her out of here now!

492
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,040
安德鲁斯医生
Dr. Andrews.

493
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,820
我认为塞拉斯可以胜任
I think Celez may be eligible

494
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,540
实验性骨治疗
for an experimental bone treatment.

495
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:53,850
说说看
Sell it to me.

496
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,180
我做了一些研究
Well, I've been doing some digging.

497
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:57,440
圣地亚哥社区医院的烧伤科
San Diego Community Hospital's burn unit

498
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,540
在遵循一家巴西医院的协议
has been following a Brazilian hospital's protocol

499
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,190
用罗非鱼鱼皮包裹烧伤部位
to wrap burns in tilapia skins.

500
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:03,960
我知道使用鱼皮听起来有点疯狂
Now -- Now, I know fish skins sound a bit crazy,

501
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,060
但我觉得我们在这里也可以做
but -- but I was thinking we could do the same thing here.

502
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:09,940
卡卢医生  你的想法很棒
Dr. Kalu, I applaud your thinking.

503
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:12,680
-但我们  -罗非鱼皮所含胶原蛋白
- But we -- - Tilapia skins contain more collagen proteins --

504
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,990
比人类皮肤还多  一号三号都有
both types 1 and 3 -- than even human skin,

505
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,270
有助于修复组织
which aids in tissue repair,

506
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,780
-就不需要移植皮肤了  -卡卢医生
- negating the need for grafts. - Dr. Kalu.

507
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,170
-并能加速皮肤恢复  减少  -卡卢医生
- It's shown to accelerate healing, would reduce... - Dr. Kalu.

508
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:21,730
避免感染的风险并降低了病人切割皮肤之痛
the risk of infection and cut down on the patient's physical pain.

509
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:24,640
你说完了吗  还是说你想再打断我
Are you finished, or would you like to cut me off again?

510
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:27,360
我们这样来  可以吗
Okay, let's follow this through, shall we?

511
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,310
你得提出一个实验性治疗的可行建议
You have to come up with a proposal for the experimental treatment,

512
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:32,570
机构审查委员会通过之后
get it approved by our institutional review board,

513
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:36,120
你去提取医学级别的罗非鱼鱼皮  然后再...
get your hands on medical-grade tilapia skins, and then we...

514
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,210
也许你可以帮助我加快进程
Well, I thought you could help expedite the process.

515
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,510
你认为我可以帮你从三个月减到两小时
You think I could bring it down from three months to two hours?

516
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:46,470
你做完清创术了吗
You finish the debridement?

517
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:50,310
-之后就交给我吧  -好
- Okay, I'll take over from here. - Okay.

518
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:52,830
挣脱思维定势
Keep thinking outside the box.

519
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,320
有主动性是好事
Initiative is good.

520
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:06,140
我来了  给她使用呼吸气囊
I'm in. Bag her.

521
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:07,230
你拿来电钻了吗
Did you get me the drill?

522
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:08,700
消防车上有  怎么回事
The fire truck had one. What's going on?

523
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:09,700
她的瞳孔扩张
Her pupil's blown.

524
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,980
她有硬脑膜下血肿
She has a subdural hematoma,

525
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,890
导致颅内压增高
causing increased intracranial pressure.

526
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:14,060
如果现在不减压
If I don't alleviate it now,

527
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:16,220
她肯定撑不到医院
there's no way she makes it to the hospital alive.

528
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:18,790
好吧
Okay.

529
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:43,020
不省人事  女性  连枷胸
Unconscious female. Flail chest.

530
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,780
我得在现场钻孔
I had to do a burr hole in field.

531
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,850
氧饱和度只有70多
Her sats are in the low 70s.

532
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:57,330
可以把她送去手术室了
She's good to go to the O.R.

533
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,550
硬脑膜下血肿
Subdural hematoma?

534
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,880
她有去大脑姿势  左瞳孔扩张
She had decerebrate posturing, a blown left pupil.

535
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,410
当我用钻头在颅骨上钻孔时
When I passed the drill bit through her skull,

536
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:05,870
涌出了一大堆血
a whole lot of blood pooled out.

537
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:06,770
做得好
Good call.

538
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,490
圣地亚哥社区医院打来了
San Diego Community Hospital called.

539
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:15,990
他们在送罗非鱼皮过来
They're sending the tilapia skins.

540
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,250
用救伤直升机送过来
They're medevacing them in.

541
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:19,330
一小时内能送到
Should be here within the hour.

542
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:20,810
塞拉斯...
Celez...

543
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:24,490
你符合一项实验治疗的标准
you meet the criteria for an experimental treatment

544
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,400
我认为这能让你免受植皮手术之苦
that I think will prevent you from having to undergo skin grafts.

545
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,620
慢着  怎么会有这样的事
Hold up. How did this even happen?

546
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:31,560
我发现圣地亚哥的试验
Well, I found out San Diego's trial

547
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,610
允许多站点协作
allows for multi-site collaborations.

548
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,650
所以我们不用有自己的伦理委员会
So, there's no need for us to get our own I.R.B.

549
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:38,950
他们把皮给我们  我们提供病人数据
They give us the skins, we provide the patient data.

550
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,250
鱼皮吗
Fish skins?

551
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:43,720
罗非鱼皮已经被清洗和杀菌
The tilapia skins have been cleaned and sterilized.

552
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:44,990
它们非常安全
They're perfectly safe.

553
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,840
你会做吧
You'll do it?

554
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:53,960
我会做
I'll do it.

555
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,640

00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:02,350
愿上帝助你

558
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,180
好的
Yes.

559
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,420
-梅伦德斯医生可以告诉你  -他说了
- Dr. Melendez can tell you -- - He has.

560
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:10,200
但假股骨是你的主意  对吧
But the fake femur is yours, though, right?

561
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:12,800
-你对这个构思有多大信心  -不是假的
- How confident are you in its design? - It's not fake!

562
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,260
-肖恩  她想知道...-我知道她想知道什么
- Shaun, she needs to know -- - I know what she needs to know.

563
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,470
她需要知道能不能成功
She needs to know will it work.

564
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:20,100
她需要知道能维持多久
She needs to know how long it will last.

565
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:23,150
是的
Yes.

566
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:24,050
好吧
Okay.

567
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:32,000
他是他的医生吗
He's his doctor?

568
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,010
他是外科住院医师  他很有天赋
He is a surgical resident. He's very gifted.

569
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:36,300
他会回答我的问题吗
Is he going to answer my questions?

570
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:38,790
肖恩  我真的需要你专注
Shaun, I really need you to focus.

571
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:44,930
-马尔科快没时间了  -让他回答吧
- Marco is running out of time! - Just let him answer!

572
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:47,040
不  我们已经知道答案了  他们不知道
No, we already know the answer. They don't know.

573
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,550
以前从未做过这种手术
This thing has never been done before.

574
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:49,610
安静
Be quiet!

575
00:28:57,810 --> 00:29:00,430
他的脚趾在变色
His toes are changing color.

576
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,380
动脉

577
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:04,030
受损

578
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:06,200
导致凝血

579
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:11,580
他在凝血  糟了  马上呼叫梅伦德斯医生
He's clotting. That's bad. Page Dr. Melendez stat!

580
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:17,500
-莫菲  什么情况  -血液分流在凝血
- Murphy, what do we got? - The shunt is clotting.

581
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,580
它在限制血流  它不行了
It's restricting blood flow. It is failing.

582
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:20,990
好吧  我们现在要做个决定
All right, we need a decision now.

583
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:22,660
要截腿还是换骨
Are we cutting off the leg or replacing the bone?

584
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,470
我相信马尔科的父母和未婚妻
There's no doubt in my mind that Marco's parents

585
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:27,340
都很爱他  但现在显然...
and fiancée all love Marco, but it's become clear --

586
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:29,100
现在给我个决定
Now. I need a decision now.

587
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,210
在父母眼中他是孩子
His parents know him as their child.

588
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,840
但在索尼娅心中他是成年人
Sonia knows him as a man.

589
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:36,930
换股骨
Replace the femur.

590
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,130
走吧
Let's go!

591
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:43,050
谢谢  谢谢
Thank you! Thank you.

592
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,300
-那就是出血  看见了吗  -看见了
- And there's the bleed. See it? - Yes, sir.

593
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,980
你有夹过颅内动脉吗
You ever clip an intracranial artery before?

594
00:29:57,890 --> 00:29:58,740
没有
No, sir.

595
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:00,340
来吧
Go for it.

596
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:09,860
每个第一次都一样
Just like every first time --

597
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,660
你有点激动  有点恶心
you're a little excited, a little nauseous.

598
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,290
希望没人受伤
Hopefully nobody gets hurt.

599
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:36,200
准备好了吗
Is it good to go?

600
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,640
非常好
It's very good.

601
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,610
钳子
Forceps.

602
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:45,900
你准备好了吗
You ready?

603
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:47,840
是的
Yes.

604
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:24,320
确保夹子的利片不会碰到有孔动脉
Be careful the clip blades don't catch any perforated arteries.

605
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:27,320
我没看见有血管挡着
I don't seen any vessels in the way.

606
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,640
那你还在等什么
Then what are you waiting for?

607
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:35,390
非常好
Very nice.

608
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,330
谢谢
Thank you.

609
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,020
没有出血
Everything's dry.

610
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,600
道别完就盖上去吧
Say goodbye and close the roof.

611
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,060
我们得在一分钟左右
We need to get blood back into his leg

612
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:49,580
让血流回他的腿
in the next minute or so,

613
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:51,980
否则我还是得做截肢
or I'm gonna have to amputate after all.

614
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:54,800
吊了胰岛素  给他输钙
Insulin's hanging, loaded him with calcium.

615
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,910
尽我所能
Best I can do.

616
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,320
现在拿掉钳夹
Let's release the clamps.

617
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:01,380
检查毛细管充血
Check for capillary refill.

618
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:16,070
血流已修复
Blood flow is restored.

619
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,380
心电图正常
EKG is normal.

620
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:26,470
金  我要听到类似「变化」和「增量」的词
Okay. Kim, I want to hear words like "Variability" and "Delta".

621
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:27,540
说给我听
Give them to me.

622
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,570
我在耐心等待
I'm waiting patiently.

623
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:34,390
什么也没有
I'm not getting anything.

624
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:36,500
给我看看
Show me.

625
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:45,830
检查引线
Check the leads.

626
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,160
还是没有
Still nothing.

627
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:57,090
也许是神经重塑
Maybe there will be some neuroplasticity.

628
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,440
她的大脑自己重新连接
Her brain -- I-it could rewire itself.

629
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:01,800
不
No.

630
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,230
没有脑部活动
Zero brain activity.

631
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:07,990
我不知道为什么  但她去世了
I don't know why, but she's gone.

632
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,300
什么
What?

633
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:29,520
你的神经外科病人今晚死了
Your neurosurgery patient that died tonight --

634
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:31,090
有件事你该知道
there's something you should know.

635
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:32,350
什么
What?

636
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,560
马尔科  我要你尝试动动你的脚趾
Now, Marco, I want you to try and move your toes.

637
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,250
我不能
I can't.

638
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:56,480
他还好吗
Is he okay?

639
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,450
我们不确定骨...
We're not sure if the bone --

640
00:33:57,450 --> 00:33:58,350
他不会死吧
He's not gonna die?

641

他不会被感染吧
H-He's not gonna get an infection?

642

-他的身体不会排斥... -不
- His body's not gonna reject -- - No, no.

643

我们密切监控他

644
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,540
-最大的威胁... -他动了

645

他动了

00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:14,750
成功了
It worked.

647
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:17,670
有漫长的复原期等着你
You'll have a long recovery ahead --

648
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:19,420
好几个月的物理治疗
months of physical therapy.

649
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,140
不过现在  你应该好好休息
But for now, all you have to do is rest.

650
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:22,150
谢谢你

651
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:26,520

准备好接着办完我们的事了吗
Are you ready to finish what we started?

654
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,080
先好起来再说
Get well first.

655
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,230
有的是时间办婚礼
There's plenty of time for a wedding.

656
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,310
-谢谢  -不用谢

00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:03,560
你看起来很好

659
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:05,910
坚强  就像潜水侠
Tough. Like Aquaman.

660
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:11,980
我看起来像寿司

大家都爱吃寿司
Everybody loves sushi.

只需要六个月
It's only for six months.

663
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:19,110
你的新皮肤应该就能完全长好了
Your new skin should have completely grown in by then.

664
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,570
瘢痕应该会很小

665
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,240
谢谢
Thank you.

666
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:26,970
我误会你了
I misjudged you.

667
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:30,590
你对我的评判很准确
You judged me just right.

668
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:44,380
她还在睡吗
Is she still sleeping?

669
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,520
-你还没告诉她吗  -没有

670
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:50,850
能出来一下吗
Can I have a moment please?

671
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:52,660
当然
Of course.

672
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:03,110
你在事故现场发现珍娜后多久
How soon after you found Jenna at the crash site

673
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,780
给她插的管
did you intubate her?

674
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,140
几乎是立刻就插了
Almost immediately.

675
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,320
我按压她的胸骨
I did a sternal rub.

676
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:10,060
她表现出去大脑强直
She had decerebrate posturing.

677
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,750
她的左侧瞳孔已经散大
Her left pupil was blown.

678
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,380
我知道她出现了硬膜下血肿
I knew she had a subdural hematoma,

679
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:16,040
所以我插了管  钻了孔
so I intubated, did the burr hole.

680
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,820
并且她还有连枷胸
She also had a flail chest.

681
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,670
你插管之后检查她的呼吸了吗
Did you check her breathing after you intubated her?

682
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:22,410
查了
Yes.

683
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:27,750
我觉得我应该查了
Well, at least I-I think I did.

684
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,950
利姆医生说珍娜到急诊的时候
Dr. Lim told me that when Jenna came into the E.R.,

685
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,890
她的呼吸并不正常
she wasn't ventilating properly.

686
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:37,830
你插管插得太深了
You inserted the tube too deep

687
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:40,600
插进了她伤侧肺的
into her right main stem bronchus

688
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:42,770
右主支气管
of her injured lung.

689
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,640
我们没法估计
We had no way of knowing

690
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:49,030
在做脑电图前她已经缺氧了多久
how long she was hypoxic before we gave her the EEG.

691
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:03,570
我在她颅骨上钻了一个非常完美的孔
I drilled a perfect burr hole into her skull

692
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:04,950
还是在夜里  在马路边
on the side of the road in the middle of the night,

693
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:07,770
但我  我插管却插坏了
and I-I-I screw up her intubation?

694
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:09,010
是的
Yes.

695
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:11,280
即使是高年资医生  当时的情况
It was tough conditions for anyone --

696
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,490
也是非常棘手的
resident or not.

697
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,980
我们任何人都有可能犯同样的错误
Any one of us could have made the same mistake.

698
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:32,900
我曾经在急诊室接诊过一个女病人
I had a woman come into the E.R. once...

699
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:36,650
51岁  是个母亲
a mother, 51 years old.

700
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:39,530
弗朗辛·帕克
Francine Parker.

701
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:41,560
她有两个儿子
She had two boys.

702
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,020
她因为咳嗽来的
She had a cough --

703
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,580
很剧烈  但也不过是个咳嗽
a bad one -- but a cough.

704
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:49,650
我给她做了检查
I checked her out,

705
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:51,520
给她开了点抗生素就让她回去了
gave her some antibiotics, sent her home.

706
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,680
六小时后  她被人送来急诊
Six hours later, she was rolled into the E.R..

707
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,230
她得了心脏病  我没发现  结果
She had had a heart attack, and I missed it, and...

708
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:00,730
她死了
she died.

709
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:06,430
从那时起
Not one day...

710
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:09,190
之后我的每一天我都会想起她
goes by when I don't think about her.

711
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:13,050
她是你的第一例
She was your first.

712
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:17,180
其实  是第四例
My fourth, actually.

713
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:21,880
你不会忘记这种病例的
You're not gonna forget this.

714
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:24,170
永远忘不了
You never forget.

715
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:27,620
但可能  下次遇到这些病例
But I don't know, maybe we're better off for it

716
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:28,980
我们可以做得更好
the next time around.

717
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:32,680
你得努力振作起来
You got to find a way to keep going.

718
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,740
回家去  去睡吧
Go home. Get some rest.

719
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:42,470
我都还没有告诉她
I haven't even told her yet.

720
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:43,840
你不准去
You're not going to.

721
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:47,940
你犯了个错误  你与此事关系太大
You made a mistake. You're too close to this.

722
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:50,180
我不能让你去和家属
I'm not gonna allow you to talk to the family

723
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:54,360
或院外的任何人谈论这事
or anyone else outside this hospital about this.

724
00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:57,430
你听明白了吗
Do we understand each other?

725
00:38:58,770 --> 00:38:59,710
明白
Yes, sir.

726
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:12,680
BGM: I Won't Let You Down by Erin McCarley

727
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:09,630
? I don't have all the words to say ?

728
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:16,110
? I'm still healing from my mistakes ?

729
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:22,460
? I'll take the weight if it makes you stronger ?

730
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:29,580
? I don't want to leave you in this place ?

731
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,350
我给圣地亚哥社区医院打电话谢谢他们
I called San Diego Community Hospital and thanked them

732
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:37,580
把我们纳入他们的研究
for including us in their study.

733
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:39,300
他们说他们非常乐意接纳我们
They said they were happy to do it.

734
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,610
并请我转达对你的感谢
And they asked that I pass along their thanks to you

735
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:47,460
感谢你对他们烧伤科无比慷慨的捐款
for your very generous donation to their burn unit.

736
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,710
我知道你家里非常有钱
I know you come from a wealthy family.

737
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:55,620
我也不是嫉妒  但你
I don't begrudge that, but you...

738
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:59,860
不能每次病人有需要你就自己掏钱
can't open your wallet every time a patient's in need.

739
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:04,430
医患之间的关系很快就会变味的
The lines can get real blurry real fast.

740
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:07,820
遵命
Yes, sir.

741
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:35,530
? Who am I to try and save you? ?

742
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:39,350
? I ain't gonna hide ?

743
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,200
? You have to fight today ?

744
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,010
这是什么
What's this?

745
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,200
我的医学委托人文件
My healthcare proxy.

746
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:46,360
杰西  不会有事的
Jess, nothing's gonna happen.

747
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:49,160
是吗  那真是太好了
Really? That's good to know.

748
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:51,290
? I won't let you down ?

749
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:52,600
? I won't let you down ?

750
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,390
? No, no, no ?

751
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:57,970
? But I won't let you down ?

752
00:40:57,970 --> 00:40:59,250
? I won't let you down ?

753
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:01,530
? No, no, no ?

754
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:12,820
真是非常忙碌的一晚
Well, that was quite a night.

755
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:15,650
即使当了这么久的医生
Been a doctor for a long while --

756
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:19,110
也没经历过像这样的夜班
don't remember a night quite like that one.

757
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:23,080
为什么法拉尔护士问我要不要爱
Why did Nurse Farrar ask if I wanted love?

758
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:24,580
因为她八卦
'Cause she's a nosy...

759
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,180
肖恩  你真的不想爱吗
Shaun, you really don't want love?

760
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:33,290
我以前爱过史蒂夫和我的兔子
I loved Steve and my rabbit.

761
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:35,310
现在不爱了
Not anymore.

762
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:37,450
你现在不爱他们了吗
You don't love them anymore?

763
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:40,810
不爱了  他们已经死了
No, I don't. They're dead.

764
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:43,440
你没法再爱一个死人了
You can't love someone if they're dead.

765
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:48,090
好吧  我爱的人也有曾经去世的
Well, I've lost people I love.

766
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:51,530
我很想他们  这很痛苦  但我仍然爱他们
I miss them, and it hurts, but I still love them.

767
00:41:57,790 --> 00:41:59,120
我不想要爱
I don't want love.

768
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,000
好吧
Okay.

769
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:10,210
你想要吃早餐吗
You want breakfast?

770
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:15,590
我能吃四个煎饼而不是三个吗
Can I have four pancakes instead of three?

771
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:16,690
你可以吃五个
You can have five.

772
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:18,740
我只想要吃四个
I only want four.

773
00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:19,930
可以
Okay.

774
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:21,990
好的
Okay.
