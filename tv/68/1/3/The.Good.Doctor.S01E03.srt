1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,950
Previously on "The Good Doctor"...

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:05,950
How hard can it be to just act like a normal human being?

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,050
No!

4
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,380
Will you stop petting that stupid rabbit? !

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,180
We're never going home again.

6
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,070
We have each other, and that's all we need.

7
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,140
Your fianc¨¦ sure can handle a knife.

8
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,860
He's got a serious deficit.

9
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:23,600
So, are you proud or disappointed?

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,630
Marcus, stop making everything so personal.

11
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:27,130
You've wanted his job since day one.

12
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:28,440
Everyone in this room knows that.

13
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,650
- How did you... - It's my department.

14
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:31,120
It's my job to know everything.

15
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,420
Since I work for you,

16
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,370
doesn't that make all this actually your fault?

17
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:36,250
Oh, I'm sorry. I stopped listening after "I work for you".

18
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,420
A surgeon needs to communicate.

19
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,500
Can Dr. Murphy do that? Can he do that under stress?

20
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,930
Can he do that knowing that a human life

21
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:44,720
literally hangs in the balance?

22
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:44,620
So, I'm in the middle of "Uncharted", and I'm dead.

23
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,300
Can I borrow some triple A's?

24
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:48,350
I'm your neighbor.

25
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:50,820
Hello.

26
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,690
34?

27
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:55,070
I moved in last week. 33.

28
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:56,080
Yeah, I know.

29
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,640
I work at a hospital.

30
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:00,120
That's cool.

31
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,140
Yes.

32
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:04,450
Triple A's, por favor?

33
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,120
Batteries.

34
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,070
Right.

35
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:08,570
Do you have any?

36
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,430
Triple A batteries.

37
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,630
Thank you.

38
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:26,010
Piece of advice -- don't feed the cat.

39
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:26,910
Which cat?

40
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,190
Feed it once, and it'll never leave you alone.

41
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,500
Thank you for the batteries, neighbor.

42
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,020
You're welcome!

43
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,190
Surgical.

44
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,420
Well, you're in luck because I'm not a nurse,

45
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,740
I'm a surgical resident.

46
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,850
How can I help you?

47
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,690
We got a liver for Chuck!

48
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,230
- Where? - SF Municipal Hospital!

49
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,320
And how long do we have body-to-body on the liver transplant?

50
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,010
- Eight hours. - Eight hours.

51
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:15,210
You don't know the longevity of a liver?

52
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,830
This is a teaching hospital, and I'm the teacher.

53
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,740
You and Murphy, you're on organ pick-up.

54
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:22,200
Check the health and bring the liver back from SFM.

55
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,290
I was at Chuck's intake. I'd really like to be --

56
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:26,210
Now you're gonna be at the intake for his new liver.

57
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,800
Jared, get Chuck down here and get him prepped.

58
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,810
We got eight hours on this thing,

59
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,390
and the clock starts ticking now.

60
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,930
Dr. Bender to the mental ward, please.

61
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,150
Dr. Bender.

62
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,410
I'm not interrupting your pre-game, am I?

63
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:59,460
I think this is my 400th breast reconstruction.

64
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,730
The board should give me a plaque.

65
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:03,540
What's up?

66
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:05,130
Your 4:00 P.M.

67
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:06,410
The V.I.P. -- Wannamaker.

68
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:07,700
Yes! The Free-Flap.

69
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,380
He's checked into the penthouse suite,

70
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,360
resting comfortably I'm sure.

71
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,630
I've been working on him for awhile now, and he's close.

72
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:16,290
He's real close to making the Foundation his tax relief.

73
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,340
That's good to hear.

74
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:18,780
I want aces on this.

75
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,440
Everything perfect.

76
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,300
That's good to know. I was gonna phone it in.

77
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,110
Dr. Bender to the mental ward, please.

78
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,920
Dr. Bender.

79
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,260
Is this the chairman's version of a pep talk?

80
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:35,270
I'm looking for a fail-safe outcome on the procedure.

81
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:38,420
I want you to use Dr. Melendez as your second.

82
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:41,500
That's your fail-safe? Melendez?

83
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:43,780
I'm your Chief of Surgery.

84
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:47,220
It's just a precaution to guarantee a perfect outcome.

85
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,500
Are you doubting my abilities?

86
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,200
Wannamaker is important.

87
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,740
Everything has to be perfect.

88
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,170
You said that already.

89
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,900
I'm your fail-safe.

90
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,660
The V.I.P. will be fine.

91
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,840
How you doing?

92
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,890
I know these sounds and everything might be a lot for you.

93
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,700
It's -- it's hard for anyone.

94
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,060
I like helicopters.

95
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,270
I, uh, didn't know you'd been on a helicopter.

96
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:17,100
I haven't.

97
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:38,940
15 minutes to San Francisco Municipal Hospital.

98
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:41,150
Should be a smooth ride.

99
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,010
You do know what this is, right?

100
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,240
Well, I'll tell you what it is. It's scut work.

101
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:11,120
Jared gets the golden ticket, and we get...

102
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:13,960
pizza delivery.

103
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,440
The rotors just go round and round, Shaun.

104
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,740
They don't change.

105
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,400
How do I talk to you?

106
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,920
So, Chuck, any chest pains, shortness of breath?

107
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,620
No.

108
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:51,430
Any alcohol in the last six months?

109
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:52,050
No.

110
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:54,650
-Here comes a quick pinch. -Any swelling in your limbs?

111
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:56,580
It's Walmart on Black Friday in here.

112
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,090
Things speed way up - when you're having a transplant.

113
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:00,030
I like it.

114
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:01,360
It's good energy.

115
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,160
So, that's a "No" on the swelling?

116
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,070
No.

117
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:08,120
I feel lousy all the time, pretty much.

118
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:13,280
But...I've got a second chance, you know, with this liver.

119
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,030
Sure.

120
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,590
Excuse me. It's my daughter.

121
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:18,520
I already spoke to Mom.

122
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,990
A-And Uncle Tommy, too.

123
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:23,320
Yeah, I need to see your face.

124
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,210
All right.

125
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,580
I love you.

126
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,640
Bye.

127
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,680
She just graduated from law school at Cal.

128
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:31,980
I told you that.

129
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,980
Uh, no. Congratulations.

130
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:36,020
I must've told Dr. Browne, then.

131
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,470
Where is Dr. Browne?

132
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:46,860
Here's your liver.

133
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,160
I'm going to need you to sign for it.

134
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,320
Standard operating procedure is to leave the liver

135
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,390
in the safety of the body cavity.

136
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,750
I'm aware of the procedure.

137
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,820
We had a John Doe - at the top of the registry,

138
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,910
but that John Doe died before we could plant.

139
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,440
How long ago did you take it out?

140
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,350
Three hours.

141
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:01,260
We just lost three hours.

142
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:03,560
Technically three hours and five minutes.

143
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,470
True clock is on the cooler.

144
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:08,410
Can't go below 39 degrees or above 47 degrees.

145
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:09,990
You want to sign for it?

146
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,910
Tissue looks healthy.

147
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:21,560
What are you doing?

148
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,310
What are you looking for?

149
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,450
-What's he doing? - I'm not sure.

150
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,880
Shaun, what are you looking for?

151
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,540
Masses? Cysts?

152
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:37,480
They're clean.

153
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,180
You think we'd miss a tumor?

154
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,550
There's nothing there.

155
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,000
I know.

156
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,550
There's nothing there.

157
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,120
Okay, the liver needs to go back into cold storage,

158
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,170
and we got to go.

159
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:57,640
...then I'll release the vascular clamp

160
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,780
and let your blood perfuse in your donor liver.

161
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,440
- That's it? - Connect the bile ducts,

162
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,000
sew you up, and then we wait.

163
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,250
Does the new one always take?

164
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,000
Over 70% of the time.

165
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,580
Oh, I can live with those odds.

166
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:11,270
You get some rest.

167
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,480
See you later.

168
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,770
He looks at something. I don't know what he's looking at.

169
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:17,620
Is he, you know, is -- is he curious?

170
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,290
Is he concerned? He won't answer me.

171
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:21,330
You're having trouble communicating with him.

172
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:23,200
It's a weekday. It's Shaun.

173
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,050
Hm, let's see. That seems about right.

174
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:26,940
He seemed different at the hospital.

175
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,820
I could kind of talk to him.

176
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,260
Well, he knows what to expect in the hospital.

177
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,010
Outside, everything's different. Everything's new.

178
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:34,000
New stimuli.

179
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,360
So, what do I do? I-I...

180
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,470
I don't know what he's thinking.

181
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:38,720
Claire, you're not gonna figure out what he's thinking,

182
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,830
so don't even try.

183
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,930
In fact, if he's thinking about something in his own mind,

184
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:42,930
just let him be.

185
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:45,110
I'd appreciate it if people gave me the same courtesy.

186
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:46,590
I thought with your history --

187
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,380
Claire, if you want to connect with him,

188
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,690
you're gonna have to figure out your own way in.

189
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:52,940
How's Chuck?

190
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:53,920
Chuck? Chuck's fine.

191
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,610
He's waiting for a liver.

192
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,050
So come home, please.

193
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:57,880
Okay.

194
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:02,760
Doctor.

195
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,490
- What's up? - I just wanted to thank you.

196
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,060
I haven't done anything yet.

197
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:09,210
You have.

198
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,140
You've given my dad hope.

199
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,590
You know, Chuck was my first patient.

200
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,850
Six months ago, - first day at St. Bonaventure,

201
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,240
I get a liver failure.

202
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:26,090
And the nicest guy in the world.

203
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:27,980
I wanted to be the one to give him the good news.

204
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,330
We're not leaving.

205
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,350
You said you liked helicopters.

206
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:34,600
We are not leaving.

207
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,030
We -- We made it here safe.

208
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:39,400
Yes, we are not leaving.

209
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,510
We're not leaving.

210
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:42,810
Fog's rolling in too quick.

211
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,200
Does that mean it rolls out quick?

212
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,840
Could be an hour. Could be three.

213
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,770
Don't know.

214
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,460
Okay, uh... We're gonna need a new ride.

215
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,370
Excuse me!

216
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:59,180
I need an ambulance to St. Bonaventure.

217
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,830
Sorry. I just don't have the EMS.

218
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,170
I've got a pile-up on I-80

219
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:03,520
and four other vehicles out on call.

220
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,140
Not one ambulance?

221
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,340
Let me be clear -- this is emergent.

222
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,380
It's time sensitive.

223
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,830
Honey, this ain't Hertz.

224
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:18,500
What about a police escort?

225
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,020
That can be arranged.

226
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:29,680
Of course.

227
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,780
Don't want to ruin the festivities.

228
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,790
But if I could just get a few minutes with my patient, alone.

229
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:39,890
Mr. Wannamaker.

230
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:43,480
Dr. Andrews.

231
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:46,910
How we doing today?

232
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:48,470
Incomplete.

233
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,950
Let's see what we can do about that.

234
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,030
Look here.

235
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:57,900
Well, looking not too bad considering we cut out a tumor

236
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,440
less than two weeks ago.

237
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,230
Yeah, I've been walking around with a hole in my mouth.

238
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,130
Ever drink Scotch with a hole in your mouth?

239
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:07,410
Waste of good Scotch.

240
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,070
We needed to give it time to heal.

241
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,870
Yeah, yeah. You told me.

242
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:15,090
Have you continued to smoke?

243
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,460
It constricts the vessels, slows the healing.

244
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:20,370
I'm not a quitter.

245
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,390
We are going to graft some skin from your leg

246
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,940
and fix that cheek up better than new.

247
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,820
I'm a real estate guy.

248
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,320
There's an old saying -- "You can have it fast.

249
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,330
You can have it good. You can have it cheap. Pick two."

250
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,510
It's not gonna be cheap.

251
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,700
I like doctors like you.

252
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,320
You're good, and you know it.

253
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:53,880
Yes. It was harvested before we got there.

254
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:55,430
We're waiting for transportation.

255
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:57,990
The itinerary and the life clock have changed.

256
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:59,790
Yeah, uh... Four hours and 14 minutes.

257
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:02,440
Excuse me! Are you talking to the hospital?

258
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:05,060
Have someone tell - Dr. Glassman

259
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,020
that I might be late for our lunch, please.

260
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,420
Yeah.

261
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,220
Okay.

262
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:17,930
So, how did you know about the weather?

263
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,650
Is it some kind of gift?

264
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,940
Come on, I got to know.

265
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,040
What, Shaun Murphy is Zeus?

266
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,400
I watch The Weather Channel.

267
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,660
You my doctors?

268
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:40,840
Shaun?

269
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,890
Shaun, we got to go!

270
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:02,560
You're home.

271
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,890
Your dad and mom have had a tough night with your brother and all.

272
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,430
Come on. Let's go.

273
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:11,400
No! No!

274
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,400
He -- He promised me!

275
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:16,870
He...He promised me!

276
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:19,380
He promised! He promised me!

277
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,290
He promised me! He promised me!

278
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,160
I think we'll get there much quicker if we drive, Shaun.

279
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,580
C-Could you turn off the flashers, please?

280
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:52,270
What's the patient's name?

281
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:53,570
I told you. It's Chuck.

282
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:55,210
- No. - No?

283
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:56,870
No. The -- The donor?

284
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,080
What's his name?

285
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,320
What? The liver?

286
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:02,150
I...

287
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:03,830
"Oliver"?

288
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,750
Oliver.

289
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,350
Hey, you got a second?

290
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:19,190
What's up?

291
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:21,390
Just waiting on a liver.

292
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:24,090
Transplant. Everyone wants in.

293
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,530
They'd trade their liver to do the liver.

294
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,660
Hey, look, uh, you want some help on this Free-Flap?

295
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,570
What's his name?

296
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:33,030
Wannamaker.

297
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,350
You got the transplant.

298
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,310
That should keep any attending busy.

299
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,760
Well, I can make time.

300
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,950
Aoki come to you about this?

301
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:41,460
Look, I get it. You're the Chief.

302
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,480
That's right.

303
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,120
Look, this -- this isn't a coup.

304
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,150
What is it?

305
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:47,520
It's about making sure this hospital is first

306
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,270
on Wannamaker's donation list.

307
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:50,940
I'm aware of the stakes.

308
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:52,710
Thanks for coming by.

309
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:57,060
You know, it doesn't make you any less of a surgeon,

310
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,520
having me in there as your second.

311
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,260
I'm the Chief. You're my attending.

312
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,280
Can't argue with that.

313
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:04,240
And we both know what your presence in my O.R. will say.

314
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,490
That's not my intention.

315
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:07,600
It's the impact. Intention doesn't matter.

316
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,690
Thanks...but I'm good.

317
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,000
These can't be right.

318
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,800
Whatever it is, it's right.

319
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,810
Chuck's labs.

320
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:32,170
It's got to be a false flag or a bad reading.

321
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:33,090
For what?

322
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:35,240
Medications? Foods? I don't know.

323
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:41,350
Look, if this is right, we lose our transplant.

324
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,350
I'm sorry. That doesn't change the results.

325
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,660
There's alcohol in his system.

326
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:49,220
He drank.

327
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:50,760
The blood doesn't lie.

328
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:54,950
Run the lab again.

329
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:00,510
E.T.A. To St. Bonaventure?

330
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,750
70 minutes.

331
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:09,970
What are you looking for?

332
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:11,790
What do you see?

333
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,130
I have a girl neighbor.

334
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:16,700
Okay.

335
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:20,020
Is she nice?

336
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:24,410
What does she do? - Does she...have a boyfriend?

337
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:27,880
Do you know her name?

338
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:36,950
What the hell are you looking for on the scans?

339
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:40,270
What the...

340
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:41,890
The temperature is going up!

341
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:45,690
Officer, we need to find a place with ice, like, now!

342
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:51,010
I tested it, Chuck. And re-tested it.

343
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,000
Talk to me. You know the six-month rule.

344
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,080
- Was it a craving? - It was three days ago.

345
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,620
My daughter's graduation.

346
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:10,100
Nobody in my family had ever gone to college.

347
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:14,760
There she was.

348
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,800
My little girl wearing the robes.

349
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:26,990
And for just that day, I...I wanted to be normal.

350
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:34,000
So, I...I had a glass of champagne.

351
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:42,840
You're out of ice?

352
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,250
It's broken. Supermarket's about three miles down.

353
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,370
We don't have time.

354
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,050
Okay. Okay.

355
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,130
The temperature's already at 47 degrees.

356
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:00,660
We can't let it go any higher.

357
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:07,550
Are you gonna help me?

358
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,880
It's sweet. You'll like it.

359
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,140
What should I do with him?

360
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,360
Child Services is down in Cheyenne.

361
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:31,720
That's 150 miles, and they'll just turn me around

362
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,400
and send me back to the parents.

363
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:35,130
The parents don't want him?

364
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:37,370
I don't know.

365
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:40,380
He doesn't seem to want the parents, that's for sure.

366
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,760
You can take him to do the hospital.

367
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:44,070
Social worker there.

368
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:51,160
That won't work.

369
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:53,420
How do you know?

370
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:54,650
Shaun?

371
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:59,740
You're right. It's not working! Why?

372
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:01,490
Shaun!

373
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,370
Are you even listening to me? !

374
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,620
Just one drink?

375
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:06,810
That's what he said.

376
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,930
Should I inform the registry?

377
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:12,510
How long ago - did Chuck have that drink?

378
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,590
Three days ago.

379
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:14,670
Give me your marker.

380
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,500
That's...

381
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:29,310
Estimated blood-alcohol content.

382
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:32,990
What type of alcohol?

383
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,580
Uh, champagne.

384
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,240
What percentage of alcohol is that?

385
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,310
I don't know. What's the difference?

386
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:38,680
Take out your phone and look it up.

387
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,460
I don't know why it's not working!

388
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:44,590
It needs to be submerged to cool.

389
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:04,320
Every five seconds is an XL.

390
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,140
Why did you answer me the last time, but not before?

391
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:10,180
Was it because I was angry?

392
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,780
Was it random?

393
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:15,750
Why can't you answer my questions?

394
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:22,170
This better work.

395
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:23,340
It will work.

396
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:28,240
You answer when I don't ask.

397
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:33,630
You don't like questions.

398
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:34,800
I don't.

399
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,430
I didn't do well in calculus.

400
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,720
This is algebra.

401
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,800
With his severe cirrhosis,

402
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:50,890
his alcohol-clearance rate is one milligram per deciliter per hour.

403
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,190
One drink, say eight ounces...

404
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,790
If it's champagne, six ounces, tops.

405
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:57,800
Play it conservative.

406
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,950
Eight ounces results in a blood alcohol level

407
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:03,550
of 39 milligrams per deciliter.

408
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:05,080
One standard drink.

409
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,660
Now, the purpose of abstinence,

410
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:12,100
at least according to the transplant registry is...

411
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,020
Patients who kill their livers due to excessive drinking

412
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,210
prove they can be sober.

413
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,490
Let me see that report.

414
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,120
0.02

415
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,380
Chuck was telling the truth.

416
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:26,260
He did have just the one drink.

417
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:27,480
He didn't fall off the wagon.

418
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,360
Corporate loves its data.

419
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:31,850
I'm not sure it'll actually make a difference,

420
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,190
but it does give us an argument.

421
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:37,040
You are a genius.

422
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,560
You don't like the cafeteria food?

423
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,670
They only make one thing well.

424
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,100
What does it say when the staff sees

425
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:58,170
the President of the hospital not eating their cafeteria food?

426
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:00,520
Well, it says the President of the hospital

427
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,080
isn't allowed in the kitchen.

428
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,960
You sat down. What can I do for you?

429
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:07,050
I'd like your advice.

430
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:07,820
Really?

431
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,140
Where's Aoki? Did she die?

432
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:12,380
This was a mistake.

433
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:13,910
That's insulting. Sit down.

434
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:15,490
At least hear what I have to say,

435
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,390
and then decide it's bad advice.

436
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:18,300
Sit.

437
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:23,560
Aoki is pushing Melendez on me for the VIP.

438
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:25,360
You didn't get the e-mail blast.

439
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,960
Rich people aren't allowed to die in this hospital.

440
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,720
You're not the young star anymore.

441
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,870
Melendez is.

442
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,070
I know that.

443
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:33,700
And you're upset about the "Why"?

444
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,860
Why does Aoki think that?

445
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,070
You should be asking "Who".

446
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:39,330
"Who"? I know who. Melendez.

447
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:40,320
Who are you?

448
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:43,120
Are you a Chief who wants to be top surgeon,

449
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,250
or are you a Chief who wants to be president?

450
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,390
'Cause if it's the latter, take your ego,

451
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:49,220
shove it in a cupboard somewhere,

452
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,280
and start acting presidential.

453
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:03,510
Dr. Melendez is going to argue to the board

454
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,470
that you get this liver.

455
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:06,100
And I think it's a pretty good argument.

456
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:08,530
Do I deserve it?

457
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:11,720
I'm... not sure that's relevant.

458
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:16,070
You know...

459
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,100
when you're dying,

460
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,300
and I've been dying for a long time,

461
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:25,640
you start to think about your life.

462
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,830
I haven't led a great one.

463
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,210
I could've been a better dad.

464
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,510
A better man.

465
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:42,040
News flash, I drank too much.

466
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:44,650
You know, I also have a son.

467
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,800
Yeah. First marriage.

468
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,400
I haven't seen him in three years.

469
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,500
Getting a liver is not a second chance,

470
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,800
and it's not a reward for being perfect.

471
00:24:58,530 --> 00:24:59,720
It's just what we can do.

472
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:01,390
Maybe.

473
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,700
But on the registry,

474
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:07,690
all of us wait in line together.

475
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,980
And I see these ...

476
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,990
these people here, waiting.

477
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,270
I know their faces.

478
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,680
Even their names.

479
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:24,580
They all have stories.

480
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:27,360
We're in it together.

481
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:30,150
And I...

482
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:33,280
I broke the...

483
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:36,280
Chuck? Chuck!

484
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,080
Chuck? Code blue!

485
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:40,430
Chuck, can you hear me?

486
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:55,570
He's got blood in his esophagus.

487
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,230
He's got a variceal bleed.

488
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,930
All right. Saline wide open. Type and cross four units.

489
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,730
I'm going to band the vein.

490
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,530
Pressure's coming up.

491
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:40,070
- Chuck had a variceal bleed. - I was in there.

492
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,440
Portal hypertension, decompensated...

493
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,330
Are you finished?

494
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,540
He's got three months to live, maybe.

495
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,030
You have to be six-months alcohol free

496
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:50,600
before you're registry eligible.

497
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,740
And you said you weren't good at math.

498
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:56,950
He gets this one or he dies.

499
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:08,430
You know what this thing looks like at 8:00 A.M.?

500
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:10,860
I need a police escort to work every morning.

501
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,370
280 South.

502
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:14,020
Where are all roads meet.

503
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,400
No, they don't!

504
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:32,530
- What's wrong with him? - He's autistic, officer.

505
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:33,620
What's that mean?

506
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:35,850
Does he need to be in a hospital?

507
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:38,230
The last place he should be is a hospital.

508
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:02,390
What are you doing?

509
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:04,430
Shaun?

510
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:06,230
What are you thinking?

511
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:14,490
Okay, this isn't a question.

512
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:17,650
I just...I don't know what you're looking for, Shaun.

513
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:20,000
Yes, I can feel it. It's firmer.

514
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:20,880
And?

515
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,320
I don't know what that means.

516
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:26,460
There must be a clot, but there isn't a clot.

517
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,230
The scan showed no clot.

518
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:39,490
That's because the scans were taken before

519
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:40,690
they harvested the liver.

520
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:43,490
Prior to the liver being flushed with UW solution!

521
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:44,560
It's dying!

522
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:46,470
To preserve the liver, they replace all its blood

523
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:48,180
with a solution to protect it from the cold storage,

524
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:50,410
but they must've left some blood behind, which clotted.

525
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:51,970
How long to St. Bonaventure?

526
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:53,730
- Less than 30 minutes. - Can't wait!

527
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,510
We have to immediately remove the clot and flush the left lobe

528
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:57,910
to protect it from the ice bath.

529
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,230
We need to stop the car.

530
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:00,480
- Here? - Yes. Yes.

531
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,490
We need to operate right here, right now.

532
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:19,170
Flush this from the right.

533
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,820
So, the left lobe,

534
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,710
starting at the middle hepatic vein.

535
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:25,900
Less intrusive cut would be along the falciform ligament

536
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:27,650
to allow access to Segment III.

537
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:29,840
When you locate the blockage, I'm gonna have to remove it.

538
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:59,480
I need a straw to cannulate the vein, please.

539
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:00,990
There's a straw in my cup.

540
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:12,150
UW solution will stabilize the cell walls.

541
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:15,160
Preserve the integrity of the organ.

542
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:32,810
This is better than having a baby in my car.

543
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:39,290
How are you feeling?

544
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,250
Like I'm writing a blank check.

545
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,480
You're gonna be fine.

546
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,410
You're the best.

547
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,410
This bleed, these varices -- this isn't good news.

548
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:59,770
Tells us that your liver failure has progressed considerably.

549
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:01,870
How much?

550
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:03,940
You have two to three months.

551
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:07,040
We're getting - the liver today, in an hour.

552
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:07,980
I don't get it.

553
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,710
You didn't tell them.

554
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:11,640
What?

555
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:13,990
Your father had a drink.

556
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:18,120
He had one glass.

557
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:21,050
Transplant registry doesn't quantify things like that.

558
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:22,370
So he doesn't get the liver?

559
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:24,010
I'm gonna try and get it for him.

560
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:25,530
What are you, a car salesman?

561
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:26,790
What, you're gonna try?

562
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:28,910
The final decision is out of my hands.

563
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:34,730
And if you fail?

564
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:38,070
I'm gonna do everything that I can.

565
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,380
I am meeting with - the committee in 10 minutes.

566
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,520
Excuse me.

567
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:50,560
BGM: American Honey by Lady Antebellum

568
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:52,400
I handed my dad the drink.

569
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:55,490
Doesn't matter how it happened.

570
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:58,170
He didn't want it. He just wanted to make me happy.

571
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:01,130
If you let him die, I will have killed my father.

572
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:30,350
It was a glass.

573
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:33,150
A glass of champagne at his daughter's graduation.

574
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:34,460
I have the labs to prove it.

575
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,900
Chuck didn't fall off the wagon.

576
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,520
He had one drink and never went back.

577
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,650
The transplant registry guidelines don't play

578
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:41,130
in the gray for a reason.

579
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:42,540
Those guidelines are so arbitrary.

580
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,790
Have one drink and you die.

581
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:45,740
A couple pills of ecstasy, no problem.

582
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:48,330
Hepatitis B from careless sexual practice, nope.

583
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:49,570
Nothing at all about that.

584
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:51,510
So, what do you want us to do? Throw out the rules?

585
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:53,280
I want us not to hide behind them.

586
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,500
We do have a responsibility.

587
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,580
Without the rules, we're playing God.

588
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:58,570
We need the rules.

589
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:00,150
Does that help you sleep better at night?

590
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:02,430
Yes, it does.

591
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:07,840
We have one liver today, and 800 people in this state need it.

592
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,020
I don't want to be haunted by the other 799.

593
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:11,380
Your guy hasn't earned it.

594
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,060
He knew the rules, and this...

595
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:15,620
it's a technicality.

596
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,400
No, the drink is a technicality.

597
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,280
Jessica, what's the legal burden here?

598
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,210
Significant.

599
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:22,160
If we move forward with this transplant,

600
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,910
we could lose privileges from the registry.

601
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:26,960
-If it were discovered. -If it were discovered?

602
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,120
How narrow can you be about this?

603
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,500
Dr. Glassman, where are you on this?

604
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,620
I can make a good argument either way.

605
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:34,950
Go ahead, please.

606
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,490
Better to remove - the arguments all together.

607
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,250
What the hell is he talking about?

608
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:41,380
All I'm talking about is that we have a patient

609
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:43,490
in this hospital who needs a liver.

610
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:46,770
We also just happen to have a liver that needs a patient.

611
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:47,680
It's not that simple.

612
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,860
It is that simple if you consider the patient.

613
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:51,870
Rules are secondary.

614
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:56,600
But is saving this patient worth the risk

615
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,570
of not being able - to save hundreds of others?

616
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:00,660
I don't have hundreds of patients right now.

617
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,940
I have one, and his name is Chuck.

618
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,240
Blood pressure's steady.

619
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,060
Donor vessel to the facial artery,

620
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,580
and we're ready to close him up.

621
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,970
10-0 polypropylene and vascular forceps.

622
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:15,600
Nice work, Dr. Andrews.

623
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:20,110
What do we have here?

624
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:23,220
hematoma?

625
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:25,330
I can see that. Let's find its source.

626
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:26,970
Sponge, stick, and probe.

627
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:28,300
Sponge, stick, and probe.

628
00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:34,010
It's not my recipient artery.

629
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:35,250
Heart rate is dropping.

630
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:37,150
Whatever it is, - it's compressing his carotid.

631
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:39,780
I can't get deep enough here. I need better access.

632
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:44,180
We move through zone three from the outside.

633
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:45,340
Zone three's a minefield.

634
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:47,330
I'm aware, but we need to do this.

635
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:48,990
Whatever you're gonna do, do it quick.

636
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:50,870
It's strangling him from the inside.

637
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,400
Get me Melendez.

638
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,230
We made it!

639
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,360
Yeah, we're here.

640
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:04,780
Downstairs, coming up.

641
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:08,080
No, no, no. Jared, you're not gonna believe wh--

642
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,150
Yeah?

643
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:18,800
Got it.

644
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:29,980
Chuck's been moved to the bottom of the list.

645
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:32,780
San Jose Presbyterian are coming to get the liver.

646
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:41,970
-Oxygen sats tanking. -Up him to 100 % O2.

647
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:43,360
You have to go through the mandible from the inside

648
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,440
to probe for the source. It's the only way.

649
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:47,210
Loupes.

650
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:51,890
We have to be careful in there, or he'll get a stroke.

651
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,190
We'll just have to be careful then.

652
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:58,560
Give Dr. Melendez - the mandibular channel retractor

653
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,650
and number five bone cutter.

654
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:00,950
number five bone cutter.

655
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:18,350
29 minutes. That's a lifetime.

656
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:20,020
Thank you. This is amazing.

657
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,540
Got to go. The whole team is waiting.

658
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:23,360
His name is Oliver.

659
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,510
It was a good day.

660
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:43,060
We saved a life...

661
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:46,110
just not Chuck's.

662
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:56,980
BGM: Build It Better by Aron Wright

663
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:06,200
* You can still see where the water was *

664
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:11,160
* In a line at the top of the chimney bricks *

665
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:14,330
It's not your fault.

666
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:16,880
I want to believe that.

668
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:26,960

00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:31,280

Hello.

672
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,780
Are you a lab guy or something?

673
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:13,800
- I'm a surgeon. - That's insane.

674
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,430
May I have my batteries back?

675
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,820
The ones you borrowed.

676
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:21,610
Yeah.

677
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:28,270
* You can still see where the water was *

678
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,230
There you go.

679
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:33,660
* In a line at the top of the chimney bricks *

680
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:35,170
What's your name?

681
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:37,130
I'm Lea.

682
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,680
I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy. Nice to meet you.

683
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:41,390
* Can never be fixed *

684
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:49,290
* So, we saved a few things that were spared *

685
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:53,680
* And brought it to the ground *

686
00:38:55,270 --> 00:39:01,340
* 'Cause you always build it better the second time around *

687
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:28,570
* I drove past the place where we used to live *

688
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:34,620
* Where you said you never wanted kids *

689
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:41,980
* Sometimes, something so broken can never be fixed *

690
00:40:09,330 --> 00:40:10,770
You'll stay with me tonight.

691
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:16,320
And tomorrow, - we'll figure out the rest.

692
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:35,440
* You always build it better *

693
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:40,670
* You always build it better *

694
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:48,140
* You always build it better the second time around *

695
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:57,170
* You always build it better the second time around *

696
00:40:57,170 --> 00:41:01,500
* You always build it better *

697
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:07,570
* You always build it better the second time around *
