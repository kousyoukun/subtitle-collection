00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:18,520
我跟妈妈说过了
I already spoke to Mom.

143
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,990
还有汤米叔叔
A-And Uncle Tommy, too.

144
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:23,320
是啊  我得亲眼看到你
Yeah, I need to see your face.

145
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,210
好的
All right.

146
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,580
我爱你
I love you.

147
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,640
再见
Bye.

148
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,680
她刚从加州大学法学院毕业
She just graduated from law school at Cal.

149
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:31,980
我跟你说过
I told you that.

150
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,980
没说过  恭喜了
Uh, no. Congratulations.

151
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:36,020
那我应该是跟布朗医生说过
I must've told Dr. Browne, then.

152
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,470
布朗医生呢
Where is Dr. Browne?

153
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,900
存活倒计时

154
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:46,860
肝源在这里
Here's your liver.

155
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,160
需要你签个字
I'm going to need you to sign for it.

156
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,320
标准操作流程是
Standard operating procedure is to leave the liver

157
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,390
把肝留在供体腹腔内
in the safety of the body cavity.

158
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,750
我知道流程
I'm aware of the procedure.

159
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,820
本来移植名单上有个无名氏排在前面
We had a John Doe - at the top of the registry,

160
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,910
但还没来得及移植那人就死了
but that John Doe died before we could plant.

161
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,440
你们摘取多久了
How long ago did you take it out?

162
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,350
三小时
Three hours.

163
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:01,260
我们一下少了三小时
We just lost three hours.

164
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:03,560
准确得说是三小时五分钟
Technically three hours and five minutes.

165
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,470
冷藏箱上有准确时间
True clock is on the cooler.

166
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:08,410
不得低于四摄氏度或高于八摄氏度
Can't go below 39 degrees or above 47 degrees.

167
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:09,990
可以签字了吗
You want to sign for it?

168
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,910
组织看起来很健康
Tissue looks healthy.

169
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:21,560
你在干什么
What are you doing?

170
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,310
你在找什么
What are you looking for?

171
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,450
-他干嘛呢  -我不知道
-What's he doing? - I'm not sure.

172
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:36,310
门静脉是八个肝段供血的主要来源

173
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,880
肖恩  你在找什么
Shaun, what are you looking for?

174
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,540
肿块  囊肿
Masses? Cysts?

175
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:37,480
肝脏没问题
They're clean.

176
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,180
你觉得我们遗漏了肿瘤
You think we'd miss a tumor?

177
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,550
没有问题
There's nothing there.

178
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,000
我知道
I know.

179
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,550
没有问题
There's nothing there.

180
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,120
好了  得把肝脏放回冷藏箱
Okay, the liver needs to go back into cold storage,

181
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,170
我们该走了
and we got to go.

182
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,680
移植用人体器官

183
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:57,640
然后我松开血管钳
...then I'll release the vascular clamp

184
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,780
让你的血液灌注到移植肝脏里
and let your blood perfuse in your donor liver.

185
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,440
-就行了吗  -连上胆管
- That's it? - Connect the bile ducts,

186
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,000
缝合  然后等待
sew you up, and then we wait.

187
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,250
新器官一般能适应吗
Does the new one always take?

188
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,000
70%以上能
Over 70% of the time.

189
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,580
这个概率我还能接受
Oh, I can live with those odds.

190
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:11,270
你先休息
You get some rest.

191
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,480
回头见
See you later.

192
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,770
他盯着看  我不知道他在看什么
He looks at something. I don't know what he's looking at.

193
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:17,620
他是...好奇吗
Is he, you know, is -- is he curious?

194
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,290
他在担心吗  他从不回答我
Is he concerned? He won't answer me.

195
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:21,330
你跟他交流有困难
You're having trouble communicating with him.

196
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:23,200
工作日嘛  肖津嘛
It's a weekday. It's Shaun.

197
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,050
再看看吧  听上去问题不大
Hm, let's see. That seems about right.

198
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:26,940
他似乎跟在医院时不一样
He seemed different at the hospital.

199
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,820
我在医院还能跟他说上话
I could kind of talk to him.

200
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,260
他对医院里的事有心理准备
Well, he knows what to expect in the hospital.

201
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,010
外面就完全不同了  一切都是新事物
Outside, everything's different. Everything's new.

202
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:34,000
新刺激
New stimuli.

203
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,360
那我该怎么办  我...
So, what do I do? I-I...

204
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,470
我不知道他在想什么
I don't know what he's thinking.

205
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:38,720
克莱尔  你不会知道他在想什么
Claire, you're not gonna figure out what he's thinking,

206
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,830
所以放弃吧
so don't even try.

207
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,930
其实  如果他在自顾自想什么
In fact, if he's thinking about something in his own mind,

208
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:42,930
就随他去好了
just let him be.

209
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:45,110
如果有人这样对我  我会很感激的
I'd appreciate it if people gave me the same courtesy.

210
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:46,590
我觉得鉴于您的经历...
I thought with your history --

211
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,380
克莱尔  如果你想跟他交流
Claire, if you want to connect with him,

212
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,690
就得找到自己的方法
you're gonna have to figure out your own way in.

213
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:52,940
查克怎么样了
How's Chuck?

214
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:53,920
查克  他很好
Chuck? Chuck's fine.

215
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,610
在等肝源
He's waiting for a liver.

216
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,050
所以请赶快回来吧
So come home, please.

217
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:57,880
好的
Okay.

218
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:02,760
医生
Doctor.

219
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,490
-什么事  -我想跟你说声谢谢
- What's up? - I just wanted to thank you.

220
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,060
我还什么都没做呢
I haven't done anything yet.

221
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:09,210
你做了
You have.

222
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,140
你给了我爸爸希望
You've given my dad hope.

223
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:17,810
存活倒计时

224
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,590
查克是我的第一个病人
You know, Chuck was my first patient.

225
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,850
六个月前我在来圣何塞圣文德医院的第一天
Six months ago, - first day at St. Bonaventure,

226
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,240
接受的肝衰患者
I get a liver failure.

227
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:26,090
他是这个世界上最好的人
And the nicest guy in the world.

228
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:27,980
我想由我来告诉他这个好消息
I wanted to be the one to give him the good news.

229
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,330
我们走不了了
We're not leaving.

230
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,350
你说过你喜欢直升飞机的
You said you liked helicopters.

231
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:34,600
我们走不了了
We are not leaving.

232
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,030
我们...我们来的时候很安全
We -- We made it here safe.

233
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:39,400
是的  但我们走不了了
Yes, we are not leaving.

234
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,510
我们走不了了
We're not leaving.

235
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:42,810
雾来的太快
Fog's rolling in too quick.

236
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,200
所以去得也快吗
Does that mean it rolls out quick?

237
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,840
可能一小时  也可能三小时
Could be an hour. Could be three.

238
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,770
谁知道
Don't know.

239
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,460
好吧  我们得用别的方法回去了
Okay, uh... We're gonna need a new ride.

240
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,880
存活倒计时

241
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,370
打扰一下
Excuse me!

242
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:59,180
我需要一辆救护车到圣何塞圣文德医院
I need an ambulance to St. Bonaventure.

243
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,830
抱歉  现在没有车搞送货
Sorry. I just don't have the EMS.

244
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,170
80号州际公路发生连环车祸
I've got a pile-up on I-80

245
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:03,520
四辆车在外待命
and four other vehicles out on call.

246
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,140
一辆救护车都没有吗
Not one ambulance?

247
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,340
听我说  这事很紧急
Let me be clear -- this is emergent.

248
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,380
一分一秒都耽搁不起
It's time sensitive.

249
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,830
亲爱的  这里不是租车行
Honey, this ain't Hertz.

250
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:18,500
那警车护送呢
What about a police escort?

251
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,020
那倒可以安排
That can be arranged.

252
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:29,680
当然
Of course.

253
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,780
我不想破坏现在的氛围
Don't want to ruin the festivities.

254
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,790
但是我想和我的病人单独待一会
But if I could just get a few minutes with my patient, alone.

255
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:39,890
万纳梅克先生
Mr. Wannamaker.

256
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:43,480
安德鲁斯医生
Dr. Andrews.

257
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:46,910
今天怎么样
How we doing today?

258
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:48,470
依旧还有个洞
Incomplete.

259
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,950
那让我们看看有什么办法吧
Let's see what we can do about that.

260
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,030
看这里
Look here.

261
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:57,900
鉴于肿瘤刚刚切除了不到两周的时间
Well, looking not too bad considering we cut out a tumor

262
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,440
看起来还不错
less than two weeks ago.

263
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,230
是啊  我一直带着嘴边的大洞到处逛
Yeah, I've been walking around with a hole in my mouth.

264
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,130
嘴边带洞喝威士忌试过没有
Ever drink Scotch with a hole in your mouth?

265
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:07,410
着实浪费了好酒
Waste of good Scotch.

266
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,070
伤口需要一定时间来愈合
We needed to give it time to heal.

267
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,870
知道  知道  你说过了
Yeah, yeah. You told me.

268
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:15,090
你还抽烟吗
Have you continued to smoke?

269
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,460
抽烟会收缩血管  减缓愈合
It constricts the vessels, slows the healing.

270
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:20,370
我不是个半途而废的人
I'm not a quitter.

271
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,390
我们准备从你的腿上移植些皮肤
We are going to graft some skin from your leg

272
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,940
将你的脸颊修复得比原来还好
and fix that cheek up better than new.

273
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,820
我是搞房地产的
I'm a real estate guy.

274
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,320
有句老话说
There's an old saying -- "You can have it fast.

275
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,330
「快速  出色和便宜  你得占两条」
You can have it good. You can have it cheap. Pick two."

276
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,510
便宜是占不了
It's not gonna be cheap.

277
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,700
我喜欢你这样的医生
I like doctors like you.

278
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,320
你很出色  你自己知道
You're good, and you know it.

279
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:53,880
存活倒计时

280
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:53,880
是的  在我们来之前就已经摘取了
Yes. It was harvested before we got there.

281
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:55,430
我们正等车送我们回去
We're waiting for transportation.

282
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:57,990
行程和存活时间都有所改变
The itinerary and the life clock have changed.

283
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:59,790
是的...还剩4小时14分钟
Yeah, uh... Four hours and 14 minutes.

284
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:02,440
打扰一下  你是在和医院通话吗
Excuse me! Are you talking to the hospital?

285
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:05,060
麻烦找人转告一下格拉斯曼医生
Have someone tell - Dr. Glassman

286
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,020
我去跟他吃午餐可能会迟到
that I might be late for our lunch, please.

287
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,420
是
Yeah.

288
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,220
好的
Okay.

289
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:17,930
所以你是怎么预知天气的
So, how did you know about the weather?

290
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,650
是某种天赋吗
Is it some kind of gift?

291
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,940
拜托  我想知道
Come on, I got to know.

292
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,040
难道肖恩·莫菲是宙斯吗
What, Shaun Murphy is Zeus?

293
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,400
我看了天气预报
I watch The Weather Channel.

294
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,660
我要接的医生是你们吗
You my doctors?

295
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:40,840
肖恩
Shaun?

296
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,890
肖恩  我们得走了
Shaun, we got to go!

297
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:02,560
你到家了
You're home.

298
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,890
因为你弟弟的事  你爸妈今晚都不太好受
Your dad and mom have had a tough night with your brother and all.

299
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,430
快  走吧
Come on. Let's go.

300
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:11,400
不要  不要
No! No!

301
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,400
他...他答应过我的
He -- He promised me!

302
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:16,870
他...他答应过我的
He...He promised me!

303
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:19,380
他答应了的  他答应过我的
He promised! He promised me!

304
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,290
他答应我的  他答应我的
He promised me! He promised me!

305
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,160
我觉得现在走的话能早点到  肖恩
I think we'll get there much quicker if we drive, Shaun.

306
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,580
能麻烦你把警灯关了吗
C-Could you turn off the flashers, please?

307
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:52,270
患者的姓名是什么
What's the patient's name?

308
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:53,570
我告诉过你了  是查克
I told you. It's Chuck.

309
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:55,210
-不是  -不是
- No. - No?

310
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:56,870
不是  器官捐献者的名字
No. The -- The donor?

311
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,080
他的名字是什么
What's his name?

312
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,320
什么  肝脏吗
What? The liver?

313
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:02,150
我...
I...

314
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:03,830
「奥利弗」
"Oliver"?

315
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,750
奥利弗
Oliver.

316
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,350
你有空吗
Hey, you got a second?

317
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:19,190
怎么了
What's up?

318
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:21,390
在等一个肝源
Just waiting on a liver.

319
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:24,090
移植手术人人都想参与
Transplant. Everyone wants in.

320
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,530
大家宁愿用自己的肝换取参与手术的机会
They'd trade their liver to do the liver.

321
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,660
话说  你的皮瓣移植需要帮忙吗
Hey, look, uh, you want some help on this Free-Flap?

322
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,570
他叫什么来着
What's his name?

323
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:33,030
万纳梅克
Wannamaker.

324
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,350
你有移植手术要做
You got the transplant.

325
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,310
任何一个主治医生都该忙得不可开交才对
That should keep any attending busy.

326
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,760
我可以挤时间
Well, I can make time.

327
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,950
青木来找过你了
Aoki come to you about this?

328
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:41,460
听着  我知道  你是主任
Look, I get it. You're the Chief.

329
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,480
没错
That's right.

330
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,120
听着  这不是政治阴谋
Look, this -- this isn't a coup.

331
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,150
那是什么
What is it?

332
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:47,520
是为了确保我们医院
It's about making sure this hospital is first

333
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,270
成为万纳梅克捐款的首选
on Wannamaker's donation list.

334
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:50,940
利害关系我清楚得很
I'm aware of the stakes.

335
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:52,710
多谢你过来告诉我
Thanks for coming by.

336
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:57,060
你知道的  让我做你的助手
You know, it doesn't make you any less of a surgeon,

337
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,520
对你没有任何坏处
having me in there as your second.

338
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,260
我是你的主任  你是我的主治医师
I'm the Chief. You're my attending.

339
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,280
这没错
Can't argue with that.

340
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:04,240
你我都清楚你出现在我的手术室里意味着什么
And we both know what your presence in my O.R. will say.

341
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,490
那并不是我的本意
That's not my intention.

342
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:07,600
重要的是产生的影响  意图不重要
It's the impact. Intention doesn't matter.

343
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,690
谢了  但是我不需要
Thanks...but I'm good.

344
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,000
这肯定有问题
These can't be right.

345
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,800
不管这是哪份报告  没有问题
Whatever it is, it's right.

346
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,810
查克的化验结果
Chuck's labs.

347
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:32,170
不是弄错了人就是化验结果有误
It's got to be a false flag or a bad reading.

348
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:33,090
怎么会
For what?

349
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:35,240
药物  或是食物  我不知道
Medications? Foods? I don't know.

350
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:41,350
如果结果没错  我们就没法移植了
Look, if this is right, we lose our transplant.

351
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,350
我很抱歉  但结果就是这样
I'm sorry. That doesn't change the results.

352
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,660
他体内有酒精
There's alcohol in his system.

353
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:49,220
他喝酒了
He drank.

354
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:50,760
血液不会撒谎
The blood doesn't lie.

355
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:54,950
重做一遍化验
Run the lab again.

356
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,290
存活倒计时

357
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:00,510
到圣何塞圣文德医院要多久
E.T.A. To St. Bonaventure?

358
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,750
七十分钟
70 minutes.

359
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:09,970
你在找什么
What are you looking for?

360
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:11,790
你看到什么了
What do you see?

361
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,130
我有个女邻居
I have a girl neighbor.

362
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:16,700
哦
Okay.

363
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:20,020
她人好吗
Is she nice?

364
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:24,410
她做什么工作的  有男朋友吗
What does she do? - Does she...have a boyfriend?

365
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:27,880
你知道她叫什么吗
Do you know her name?

366
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:36,950
你到底在片子上找什么呢
What the hell are you looking for on the scans?

367
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:40,270
怎么会
What the...

368
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:41,890
温度在升高
The temperature is going up!

369
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:45,690
警官  我们得找个有冰的地方  马上
Officer, we need to find a place with ice, like, now!

370
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:51,010
我验过了  查克  验了两遍
I tested it, Chuck. And re-tested it.

371
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,000
说话啊  你知道六个月内不能喝酒的规定
Talk to me. You know the six-month rule.

372
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,080
-是忍不住吗  -是三天前
- Was it a craving? - It was three days ago.

373
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,620
我女儿的毕业典礼
My daughter's graduation.

374
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:10,100
我们家里没有人上过大学
Nobody in my family had ever gone to college.

375
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:14,760
她就站在那
There she was.

376
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,800
我的宝贝女儿穿着学士服
My little girl wearing the robes.

377
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:26,990
那一天我只想做个平凡的父亲
And for just that day, I...I wanted to be normal.

378
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:34,000
所以我喝了一杯香槟
So, I...I had a glass of champagne.

379
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,030
存活倒计时

380
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:42,840
你们没有冰了
You're out of ice?

381
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,250
冰箱坏了  五公里外有个超市
It's broken. Supermarket's about three miles down.

382
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,370
我们没时间了
We don't have time.

383
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,050
好吧  好吧
Okay. Okay.

384
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,130
温度已经到八摄氏度了
The temperature's already at 47 degrees.

385
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:00,660
我们不能让它再继续升高了
We can't let it go any higher.

386
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:07,550
你不来帮我吗
Are you gonna help me?

387
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,880
甜的  你会喜欢的
It's sweet. You'll like it.

388
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,140
我该拿他怎么办
What should I do with him?

389
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,360
儿童保护机构在夏延
Child Services is down in Cheyenne.

390
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:31,720
有240公里远  而且他们肯定会
That's 150 miles, and they'll just turn me around

391
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,400
打发我调头送到他父母那里
and send me back to the parents.

392
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:35,130
他父母不想要他吗
The parents don't want him?

393
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:37,370
不知道
I don't know.

394
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:40,380
可以肯定的是他不想要他父母
He doesn't seem to want the parents, that's for sure.

395
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,760
你可以带他去医院
You can take him to do the hospital.

396
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:44,070
那有社工
Social worker there.

397
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:51,160
这样不管用
That won't work.

398
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:53,420
你怎么知道
How do you know?

399
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:54,650
肖恩
Shaun?

400
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:59,740
你说得对  不管用  为什么
You're right. It's not working! Why?

401
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:01,490
肖恩
Shaun!

402
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,370
你到底有没有在听我说话
Are you even listening to me?!

403
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,620
只喝了一杯
Just one drink?

404
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:06,810
他是这么说的
That's what he said.

405
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,930
要不要通知器官移植登记中心
Should I inform the registry?

406
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:12,510
查克多长时间以前喝的那杯酒
How long ago - did Chuck have that drink?

407
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,590
三天前
Three days ago.

408
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:14,670
把记号笔给我
Give me your marker.

409
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,500
这是
That's...

410
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:29,310
血液酒精含量估计值
Estimated blood-alcohol content.

411
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:32,990
他喝的是什么酒
What type of alcohol?

412
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,580
香槟
Uh, champagne.

413
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,240
酒精含量是多少
What percentage of alcohol is that?

414
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,310
我不知道  有什么关系吗
I don't know. What's the difference?

415
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:38,680
把手机拿出来查查
Take out your phone and look it up.

416
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,460
我不知道为什么它不管用
I don't know why it's not working!

417
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:44,590
要被冰水淹没才可以
It needs to be submerged to cool.

418
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:04,320
每开五秒就是一份特大杯沙冰
Every five seconds is an XL.

419
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,140
为什么最后一次你回答我了  之前不回答
Why did you answer me the last time, but not before?

420
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:10,180
是因为我生气了吗
Was it because I was angry?

421
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,780
是巧合吗
Was it random?

422
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:15,750
为什么你就不能回答我的问题
Why can't you answer my questions?

423
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:22,170
最好管用
This better work.

424
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:23,340
会管用的
It will work.

425
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:28,240
我不问你就会说
You answer when I don't ask.

426
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:33,630
你不喜欢问题
You don't like questions.

427
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:34,800
不喜欢
I don't.

428
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,430
我微积分没学好
I didn't do well in calculus.

429
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,720
这是代数
This is algebra.

430
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,800
他有重度肝硬化
With his severe cirrhosis,

431
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:50,890
酒精清除率为每小时一毫克每分升
his alcohol-clearance rate is one milligram per deciliter per hour.

432
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,190
一杯酒  就算八盎司
One drink, say eight ounces...

433
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,790
香槟的话最多六盎司
If it's champagne, six ounces, tops.

434
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:57,800
按保守估计
Play it conservative.

435
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,950
八盎司导致血液酒精浓度
Eight ounces results in a blood alcohol level

436
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:03,550
上升39毫克每分升
of 39 milligrams per deciliter.

437
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:05,080
这是标准杯量
One standard drink.

438
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,660
而禁酒的目的
Now, the purpose of abstinence,

439
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:12,100
至少根据移植中心的说法...
at least according to the transplant registry is...

440
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,020
是让由过量饮酒引起肝病的患者
Patients who kill their livers due to excessive drinking

441
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,210
证明自己可以戒酒
prove they can be sober.

442
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,490
给我看一下报告
Let me see that report.

443
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,120
0.02

444
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,380
查克说的是实话
Chuck was telling the truth.

445
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:26,260
他确实只喝了一杯
He did have just the one drink.

446
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:27,480
他没有中断戒酒
He didn't fall off the wagon.

447
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,360
董事会会喜欢这个数据
Corporate loves its data.

448
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:31,850
我不确定这是否有用
I'm not sure it'll actually make a difference,

449
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,190
但至少给了我们论据
but it does give us an argument.

450
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:37,040
你是个天才
You are a genius.

451
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,560
你不喜欢食堂的饭菜吗
You don't like the cafeteria food?

452
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,670
他们能把东西做熟就不错了
They only make one thing well.

453
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,100
要是员工看见他们的院长
What does it say when the staff sees

454
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:58,170
不吃食堂的饭菜会怎么想
the President of the hospital not eating their cafeteria food?

455
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:00,520
这说明院长
Well, it says the President of the hospital

456
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,080
不允许进厨房
isn't allowed in the kitchen.

457
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,960
你坐这的意思是我能为你做什么吗
You sat down. What can I do for you?

458
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:07,050
我想听听你的建议
I'd like your advice.

459
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:07,820
是吗
Really?

460
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,140
青木呢  她去世了吗
Where's Aoki? Did she die?

461
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:12,380
这真是个错误
This was a mistake.

462
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:13,910
这么说真伤人啊  坐下吧
That's insulting. Sit down.

463
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:15,490
至少听完我要说什么
At least hear what I have to say,

464
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,390
再说这是个坏主意
and then decide it's bad advice.

465
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:18,300
坐吧
Sit.

466
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:23,560
青木把梅伦德斯推给我参与VIP的手术
Aoki is pushing Melendez on me for the VIP.

467
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:25,360
你没看到群发邮件吧
You didn't get the e-mail blast.

468
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,960
有钱人不能死在这家医院里
Rich people aren't allowed to die in this hospital.

469
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,720
你不再是明日之星了
You're not the young star anymore.

470
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,870
梅伦德斯才是
Melendez is.

471
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,070
我知道
I know that.

472
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:33,700
那你还为「为什么」而苦恼吗
And you're upset about the "Why"?

473
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,860
为什么青木这么想
Why does Aoki think that?

474
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,070
你应该问的是「谁」
You should be asking "Who".

475
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:39,330
「谁」  我知道是谁  梅伦德斯
"Who"? I know who. Melendez.

476
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:40,320
你是「谁」
Who are you?

477
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:43,120
你是想当顶级外科医生的主任
Are you a Chief who wants to be top surgeon,

478
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,250
还是个想当院长的主任
or are you a Chief who wants to be president?

479
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,390
因为若是后者  就收起你的自我
'Cause if it's the latter, take your ego,

480
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:49,220
塞进什么碗柜里
shove it in a cupboard somewhere,

481
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,280
表现得像个院长的样子
and start acting presidential.

482
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:03,510
梅伦德斯医生会和董事会沟通
Dr. Melendez is going to argue to the board

483
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,470
让你移植这个肝脏
that you get this liver.

484
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:06,100
我认为胜算很大
And I think it's a pretty good argument.

485
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:08,530
我值得吗
Do I deserve it?

486
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:11,720
我认为这与此无关
I'm... not sure that's relevant.

487
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:16,070
你知道吗
You know...

488
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,100
当人濒死时
when you're dying,

489
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,300
而我已经濒死很久了
and I've been dying for a long time,

490
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:25,640
你会开始思考自己的人生
you start to think about your life.

491
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,830
我的人生不尽人意
I haven't led a great one.

492
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,210
我本该成为一个更好的父亲
I could've been a better dad.

493
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,510
更好的男人
A better man.

494
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:42,040
告诉你  我曾酗酒
News flash, I drank too much.

495
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:44,650
我还有个儿子
You know, I also have a son.

496
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,800
第一次婚姻时生的
Yeah. First marriage.

497
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,400
我有三年没见过他了
I haven't seen him in three years.

498
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,500
肝脏移植不是你的第二次生命
Getting a liver is not a second chance,

499
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,800
也不是给好人的奖励
and it's not a reward for being perfect.

500
00:24:58,530 --> 00:24:59,720
只是我们能做的
It's just what we can do.

501
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:01,390
也许吧
Maybe.

502
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,700
但在移植登记中心里
But on the registry,

503
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:07,690
我们所有人都排着队
all of us wait in line together.

504
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,980
而我看到...
And I see these ...

505
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,990
那些人等着
these people here, waiting.

506
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,270
我认识他们的脸
I know their faces.

507
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,680
甚至知道他们的名字
Even their names.

508
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:24,580
他们都有各自的故事
They all have stories.

509
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:27,360
我们一起排在上面
We're in it together.

510
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:30,150
而我...
And I...

511
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:33,280
我打破了...
I broke the...

512
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:36,280
查克  查克
Chuck? Chuck!

513
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,080
查克  紧急呼叫
Chuck? Code blue!

514
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:40,430
查克  你能听见吗
Chuck, can you hear me?

515
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:55,570
他食管里有血
He's got blood in his esophagus.

516
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,230
静脉曲张出血
He's got a variceal bleed.

517
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,930
开一袋生理盐水  交叉配型四个单位
All right. Saline wide open. Type and cross four units.

518
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,730
我来结扎静脉
I'm going to band the vein.

519
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,530
血压回升了
Pressure's coming up.

520
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:40,070
-查克静脉曲张出血  -我也在场
- Chuck had a variceal bleed. - I was in there.

521
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,440
门脉高压  代偿失调
Portal hypertension, decompensated...

522
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,330
你说完了吗
Are you finished?

523
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,540
他可能只剩三个月了
He's got three months to live, maybe.

524
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,030
他得禁酒六个月
You have to be six-months alcohol free

525
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:50,600
才有资格进入移植名单
before you're registry eligible.

526
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,740
你还说自己数学不好呢
And you said you weren't good at math.

527
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:56,950
他得不到这个肝源就必死无疑
He gets this one or he dies.

528
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,210
存活倒计时

529
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:08,430
你知道早上八点坐警车是什么体验吗
You know what this thing looks like at 8:00 A.M.?

530
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:10,860
我需要警车每天早上护送我上班
I need a police escort to work every morning.

531
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,370
所有道路都在
280 South.

532
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:14,020
280号公路南段汇聚
Where are all roads meet.

533
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:19,960
圣何塞

534
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,400
不对
No, they don't!

535
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:32,530
-他怎么了  -他有自闭症  警官
- What's wrong with him? - He's autistic, officer.

536
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:33,620
那是什么意思
What's that mean?

537
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:35,850
他需要去医院吗
Does he need to be in a hospital?

538
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:38,230
他最不该去的地方就是医院
The last place he should be is a hospital.

539
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:02,390
你在做什么
What are you doing?

540
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:04,430
肖恩
Shaun?

541
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:06,230
你在想什么
What are you thinking?

542
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:14,490
好吧  我不是在问你问题
Okay, this isn't a question.

543
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:17,650
我只是  我不知道你在找什么  肖恩
I just...I don't know what you're looking for, Shaun.

544
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:20,000
我感觉得到  它变得更紧实了
Yes, I can feel it. It's firmer.

545
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:20,880
然后呢
And?

546
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,320
我不知道那是什么意思
I don't know what that means.

547
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:26,460
这里面肯定有凝块  但我找不到
There must be a clot, but there isn't a clot.

548
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,230
片子里看不到凝块
The scan showed no clot.

549
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:39,490
那是因为片子是在
That's because the scans were taken before

550
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:40,690
摘除肝脏之前拍的
they harvested the liver.

551
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:43,490
那时肝脏还没有用UW液冲洗
Prior to the liver being flushed with UW solution!

552
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:44,560
它要死了
It's dying!

553
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:46,470
为了保存肝脏  他们把里面的血液
To preserve the liver, they replace all its blood

554
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:48,180
全部替换为防止肝脏被冻伤的溶液
with a solution to protect it from the cold storage,

555
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:50,410
但里面肯定残留了血液  形成了凝块
but they must've left some blood behind, which clotted.

556
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:51,970
离圣文德医院还有多远
How long to St. Bonaventure?

557
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:53,730
-不到三十分钟  -来不及了
- Less than 30 minutes. - Can't wait!

558
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,510
我们必须马上清除凝块  冲洗左叶
We have to immediately remove the clot and flush the left lobe

559
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:57,910
防止肝脏冻伤
to protect it from the ice bath.

560
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,230
必须马上停车
We need to stop the car.

561
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:00,480
-在这里吗  -对  对
- Here? - Yes. Yes.

562
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,490
我们必须马上就地操作
We need to operate right here, right now.

563
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:19,170
从右边进行冲洗
Flush this from the right.

564
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,820
左叶
So, the left lobe,

565
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,710
从肝中静脉开始
starting at the middle hepatic vein.

566
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:25,900
沿镰状韧带做切口进入第三肝段
Less intrusive cut would be along the falciform ligament

567
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:27,650
侵入性更低
to allow access to Segment III.

568
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:29,840
你定位堵塞点  我来清除
When you locate the blockage, I'm gonna have to remove it.

569
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:59,480
我需要一根吸管做静脉插管
I need a straw to cannulate the vein, please.

570
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:00,990
我杯子里有根吸管
There's a straw in my cup.

571
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:12,150
UW溶液可以稳定细胞壁
UW solution will stabilize the cell walls.

572
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:15,160
保护器官的完整性
Preserve the integrity of the organ.

573
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:32,810
这总比在我车里生孩子强
This is better than having a baby in my car.

574
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:39,290
你感觉怎么样
How are you feeling?

575
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,250
像在开空头支票
Like I'm writing a blank check.

576
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,480
你会没事的
You're gonna be fine.

577
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,410
你是最好的医生
You're the best.

578
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,410
出血  静脉曲张  这些都不是好现象
This bleed, these varices -- this isn't good news.

579
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:59,770
说明你的肝衰竭严重恶化了
Tells us that your liver failure has progressed considerably.

580
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:01,870
有多严重
How much?

581
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:03,940
你还能活两到三个月
You have two to three months.

582
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:07,040
我们今天就有肝源了  一个小时后
We're getting - the liver today, in an hour.

583
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:07,980
我不明白你在说什么
I don't get it.

584
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,710
你没告诉她们
You didn't tell them.

585
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:11,640
什么
What?

586
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:13,990
你父亲喝酒了
Your father had a drink.

587
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:18,120
他就喝了一杯
He had one glass.

588
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:21,050
移植登记中心不管你喝了多少
Transplant registry doesn't quantify things like that.

589
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:22,370
所以他得不到这个肝源了吗
So he doesn't get the liver?

590
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:24,010
我会试着帮他争取
I'm gonna try and get it for him.

591
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:25,530
你是汽车销售员吗
What are you, a car salesman?

592
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:26,790
只会试试
What, you're gonna try?

593
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:28,910
最终决定权不在我这
The final decision is out of my hands.

594
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:34,730
如果你失败了呢
And if you fail?

595
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:38,070
我会竭尽全力
I'm gonna do everything that I can.

596
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,380
我十分钟后跟委员会开会
I am meeting with - the committee in 10 minutes.

597
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,520
失陪了
Excuse me.

598
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:50,560
BGM: American Honey by Lady Antebellum

599
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:52,400
那杯酒是我递给我爸爸的
I handed my dad the drink.

600
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:55,490
事情经过不重要
Doesn't matter how it happened.

601
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:58,170
他不想喝的  只是想让我开心
He didn't want it. He just wanted to make me happy.

602
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:01,130
如果你不救他  就是我亲手杀死了他
If you let him die, I will have killed my father.

603
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:30,350
就一杯
It was a glass.

604
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:33,150
他女儿的毕业典礼上的一杯香槟
A glass of champagne at his daughter's graduation.

605
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:34,460
化验结果可以证明
I have the labs to prove it.

606
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,900
查克没有中断戒酒
Chuck didn't fall off the wagon.

607
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,520
他只喝了一杯  仅此而已
He had one drink and never went back.

608
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,650
移植登记中心的指南
The transplant registry guidelines don't play

609
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:41,130
不留余地是有原因的
in the gray for a reason.

610
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:42,540
那些规定太专制了
Those guidelines are so arbitrary.

611
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,790
喝一杯酒就被剥夺生的希望
Have one drink and you die.

612
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:45,740
吃摇头丸却没问题
A couple pills of ecstasy, no problem.

613
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:48,330
高危性行为导致的乙型肝炎也没问题
Hepatitis B from careless sexual practice, nope.

614
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:49,570
什么规定都没有
Nothing at all about that.

615
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:51,510
所以你想我们怎么做  无视规定吗
So, what do you want us to do? Throw out the rules?

616
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:53,280
我希望我们不要拿规定当挡箭牌
I want us not to hide behind them.

617
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,500
负起责任来
We do have a responsibility.

618
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,580
没有了规则  那我们就是在扮演上帝
Without the rules, we're playing God.

619
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:58,570
我们需要规则
We need the rules.

620
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:00,150
它会让你晚上睡得更安稳吗
Does that help you sleep better at night?

621
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:02,430
会
Yes, it does.

622
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:07,840
全州有八百人需要今天这个肝源
We have one liver today, and 800 people in this state need it.

623
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,020
我不想对另外799人心怀愧疚
I don't want to be haunted by the other 799.

624
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:11,380
你的病人自己丢掉了这个机会
Your guy hasn't earned it.

625
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,060
他知道规定  这...
He knew the rules, and this...

626
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:15,620
这是一个技术性细则
it's a technicality.

627
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,400
不  这杯酒才是一个技术性细则
No, the drink is a technicality.

628
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,280
杰西卡  这里面涉及什么法律责任
Jessica, what's the legal burden here?

629
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,210
十分重大
Significant.

630
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:22,160
如果我们进行移植
If we move forward with this transplant,

631
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,910
可能会失去移植中心的特权
we could lose privileges from the registry.

632
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:26,960
-如果被发现的话  -如果被发现
-If it were discovered. -If it were discovered?

633
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,120
你是有多狭隘
How narrow can you be about this?

634
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,500
格拉斯曼医生  你怎么看
Dr. Glassman, where are you on this?

635
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,620
两边都有理
I can make a good argument either way.

636
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:34,950
请继续
Go ahead, please.

637
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,490
最好将这些争论都解决掉
Better to remove - the arguments all together.

638
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,250
他到底在说什么
What the hell is he talking about?

639
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:41,380
我是说我们医院有个患者
All I'm talking about is that we have a patient

640
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:43,490
需要肝源
in this hospital who needs a liver.

641
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:46,770
我们也恰好有一个肝脏需要一个患者
We also just happen to have a liver that needs a patient.

642
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:47,680
没那么简单
It's not that simple.

643
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,860
如果你为患者考虑就这么简单
It is that simple if you consider the patient.

644
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:51,870
规则是次要的
Rules are secondary.

645
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:56,600
但救这个患者值得我们承担
But is saving this patient worth the risk

646
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,570
救不了剩下几百个的风险吗
of not being able - to save hundreds of others?

647
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:00,660
我现在没有几百个患者
I don't have hundreds of patients right now.

648
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,940
只有一个  他叫查克
I have one, and his name is Chuck.

649
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,240
血压稳定
Blood pressure's steady.

650
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,060
面动脉接入供体血管
Donor vessel to the facial artery,

651
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,580
准备缝合
and we're ready to close him up.

652
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,970
10-0缝合线和血管钳
10-0 polypropylene and vascular forceps.

653
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:15,600
干得好  安德鲁斯医生
Nice work, Dr. Andrews.

654
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:20,110
这是什么
What do we have here?

655
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:23,220
血肿
hematoma?

656
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:25,330
我看见了  找出来源吧
I can see that. Let's find its source.

657
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:26,970
纱布棒  探针
Sponge, stick, and probe.

658
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:28,300
纱布棒  探针
Sponge, stick, and probe.

659
00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:34,010
不是受体动脉
It's not my recipient artery.

660
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:35,250
心率在下降
Heart rate is dropping.

661
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:37,150
不管是什么  都在压迫他的颈动脉
Whatever it is, - it's compressing his carotid.

662
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:39,780
我无法深入病灶  需要更好的切口
I can't get deep enough here. I need better access.

663
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:44,180
从外部进入第三区
We move through zone three from the outside.

664
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:45,340
第三区是危险区
Zone three's a minefield.

665
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:47,330
我知道  但必须这样做
I'm aware, but we need to do this.

666
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:48,990
不管你做什么  赶紧
Whatever you're gonna do, do it quick.

667
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:50,870
里面的东西正威胁着他
It's strangling him from the inside.

668
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,400
叫梅伦德斯过来
Get me Melendez.

669
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:59,460
存活倒计时

670
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,230
赶到了
We made it!

671
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,360

Yeah, we're here.

672
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:04,780
下楼  来吧
Downstairs, coming up.

673
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:08,080
不不不  杰瑞德  你肯定不信
No, no, no. Jared, you're not gonna believe wh--

674
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,150
啊
Yeah?

675
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:18,800
知道了
Got it.

676
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:29,980
查克被放在了名单最后
Chuck's been moved to the bottom of the list.

677
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:32,780
圣何塞长老会医院正过来取肝源
San Jose Presbyterian are coming to get the liver.

678
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:41,970
-血氧饱和度下降  -给予100%浓度吸氧
-Oxygen sats tanking. -Up him to 100 % O2.

679
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:43,360
你得从里面穿过下颌
You have to go through the mandible from the inside

680
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,440
来探测来源  只能这样
to probe for the source. It's the only way.

681
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:47,210
手术放大镜
Loupes.

682
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:51,890
我们必须小心  否则他可能会中风
We have to be careful in there, or he'll get a stroke.

683
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,190
我们需要的只是小心
We'll just have to be careful then.

684
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:58,560
给梅伦德斯医生下颌槽状拉钩
Give Dr. Melendez - the mandibular channel retractor

五号骨刀
number five bone cutter.

687
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:18,350
存活时间剩余29分钟
29 minutes. That's a lifetime.

688
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:20,020
谢谢  真是太好了
Thank you. This is amazing.

689
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,540
我得走了  整个组都等着呢
Got to go. The whole team is waiting.

690
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:23,360
他叫奥利弗
His name is Oliver.

691
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,510
真是美好的一天
It was a good day.

692
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:43,060
我们拯救了一个生命
We saved a life...

693
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:46,110
只不过不是查克的
just not Chuck's.

694
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:56,980
BGM: Build It Better by Aron Wright

695
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:06,200
? You can still see where the water was ?

696
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:11,160
? In a line at the top of the chimney bricks ?

697
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:14,330
这不是你的错
It's not your fault.

698
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:16,880
我也想相信
I want to believe that.

699
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,130
? Can never be fixed ?

700
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:26,960
? So, we saved a few things that were spared ?

701
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:31,280
? And brought it to the ground ?

702
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:39,100
? 'Cause you always build it better the second time around ?

703
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:09,150

你是个实验员还是
Are you a lab guy or something?

705
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:13,800
-我是个外科医生  -那太疯狂了
- I'm a surgeon. - That's insane.

706
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,430
我能要回我的电池吗
May I have my batteries back?

707
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,820
你借的那些
The ones you borrowed.

708
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:21,610
好啊

709
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:28,270

给你
There you go.

711
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:33,660
? In a line at the top of the chimney bricks ?

712
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:35,170
你叫什么名字
What's your name?

715
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:41,390
? Can never be fixed ?

716
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:49,290
? So, we saved a few things that were spared ?

717
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:53,680
? And brought it to the ground ?

718
00:38:55,270 --> 00:39:01,340
? 'Cause you always build it better the second time around ?

719
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:28,570
? I drove past the place where we used to live ?

720
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:34,620
? Where you said you never wanted kids ?

721
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:41,980
? Sometimes, something so broken can never be fixed ?

722
00:40:09,330 --> 00:40:10,770
你今晚就跟我待在一起
You'll stay with me tonight.

723
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:16,320
明天我们再解决其他事
And tomorrow, - we'll figure out the rest.

724
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:35,440
? You always build it better ?

725
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:40,670
? You always build it better ?

726
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:48,140
? You always build it better the second time around ?

727
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:57,170
? You always build it better the second time around ?

728
00:40:57,170 --> 00:41:01,500
? You always build it better ?

729
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:07,570
