<i>Previously on "The Good Doctor"...</i>

2
00:00:02,893 --> 00:00:03,925
How hard can it be

3
00:00:03,927 --> 00:00:06,621
to just act like a normal human being?

4
00:00:06,768 --> 00:00:07,934
No!

5
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:09,694
Would you stop petting
that stupid rabbit?!

6
00:00:10,747 --> 00:00:11,880
We're never going home again.

7
00:00:11,882 --> 00:00:13,781
We have each other,
and that's all we need.

8
00:00:15,017 --> 00:00:16,752
Aah!

9
00:00:17,925 --> 00:00:20,225
Your fiancé sure can handle a knife.

10
00:00:20,227 --> 00:00:21,994
He's got a serious deficit.

11
00:00:21,996 --> 00:00:24,430
So, are you proud or disappointed?

12
00:00:24,432 --> 00:00:26,665
Marcus, stop making
everything so personal.

13
00:00:26,667 --> 00:00:28,233
You've wanted his job since day one.

14
00:00:28,235 --> 00:00:29,535
Everyone in this room knows that.

15
00:00:29,537 --> 00:00:30,836
How did you... It's my department.

16
00:00:30,838 --> 00:00:32,438
It's my job to know everything.

17
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:34,540
Since I work for you,
doesn't that make all this

18
00:00:34,542 --> 00:00:35,931
- actually your fault?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

19
00:00:35,933 --> 00:00:37,242
I stopped listening after
"I work for you".

20
00:00:37,244 --> 00:00:40,412
A surgeon needs to communicate.
Can Dr. Murphy do that?

21
00:00:40,414 --> 00:00:41,580
Can he do that under stress?

22
00:00:41,582 --> 00:00:43,882
Can he do that knowing that a human life

23
00:00:43,884 --> 00:00:45,819
literally hangs in the balance?

24
00:01:42,075 --> 00:01:45,711
So, I'm in the middle of
"Uncharted", and I'm dead.

25
00:01:45,713 --> 00:01:47,591
Can I borrow some triples A's?

26
00:01:48,215 --> 00:01:49,760
I'm your neighbor.

27
00:01:50,851 --> 00:01:51,850
Hello.

28
00:01:51,852 --> 00:01:53,180
34?

29
00:01:53,921 --> 00:01:56,155
I moved in last week. 33.

30
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:57,476
Yeah, I know.

31
00:01:58,058 --> 00:01:59,558
I work at a hospital.

32
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,093
That's cool.

33
00:02:01,095 --> 00:02:02,694
Yes.

34
00:02:02,696 --> 00:02:05,230
Triple A's, <i>por favor?</i>

35
00:02:05,943 --> 00:02:07,132
Batteries.

36
00:02:07,134 --> 00:02:08,467
Right.

37
00:02:08,469 --> 00:02:09,988
Do you have any?

38
00:02:21,948 --> 00:02:23,682
Triple A batteries.

39
00:02:23,684 --> 00:02:25,083
Thank you.

40
00:02:25,085 --> 00:02:26,919
Piece of advice... don't feed the cat.

41
00:02:26,921 --> 00:02:28,220
Which cat?

42
00:02:28,222 --> 00:02:30,055
Feed it once, and it'll
never leave you alone.

43
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:33,458
Thank you for the batteries, neighbor.

44
00:02:36,863 --> 00:02:38,559
You're welcome!

45
00:02:41,669 --> 00:02:44,469
<i>Dr. Forrest, dial 118, please.</i>

46

47
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:51,863
Surgical.

48
00:02:52,746 --> 00:02:54,479
Well, you're in luck
because I'm not a nurse,

49
00:02:54,481 --> 00:02:55,681
I'm a surgical resident.

50
00:02:55,683 --> 00:02:57,202
How can I help you?

51
00:03:08,261 --> 00:03:09,728
We got a liver for Chuck!

52
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,163
- Where?
- SF Municipal Hospital!

53
00:03:11,165 --> 00:03:12,397
And how long do we have body-to-body

54
00:03:12,399 --> 00:03:13,332
on the liver transplant?

55
00:03:13,334 --> 00:03:14,399
- Eight hours.
- Eight hours.

56
00:03:14,401 --> 00:03:16,401
You don't know the longevity of a liver?

57
00:03:16,403 --> 00:03:18,704
This is a teaching hospital,
and I'm the teacher.

58
00:03:18,706 --> 00:03:20,806
You and Murphy, you're on organ pick-up.

59
00:03:20,808 --> 00:03:22,841
Check the health and bring
the liver back from SFM.

60
00:03:22,843 --> 00:03:25,310
I was at Chuck's intake.
I'd really like to be...

61
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:27,274
Now you're gonna be at the
intake for his new liver.

62
00:03:27,982 --> 00:03:29,781
Jared, get Chuck down here
and get him prepped.

63
00:03:29,783 --> 00:03:31,216
We got eight hours on this thing,

64
00:03:31,218 --> 00:03:32,654
and the clock starts ticking now.

68
00:03:55,075 --> 00:03:57,542
I'm not interrupting
your pre-game, am I?

69
00:03:57,544 --> 00:04:00,812
I think this is my
400th breast reconstruction.

70
00:04:00,814 --> 00:04:03,101
The board should give me a plaque.

71
00:04:03,717 --> 00:04:04,816
What's up?

72
00:04:04,818 --> 00:04:05,984
Your 4:00 P.M.

73
00:04:05,986 --> 00:04:07,319
The V.I.P... Wannamaker.

74
00:04:07,321 --> 00:04:08,687
Yes! The Free-Flap.

75
00:04:08,689 --> 00:04:10,222
He's checked into the penthouse suite,

76
00:04:10,224 --> 00:04:11,552
resting comfortably I'm sure.

77
00:04:11,554 --> 00:04:14,426
I've been working on him for
awhile now, and he's close.

78
00:04:14,428 --> 00:04:17,262
He's real close to making
the Foundation his tax relief.

79
00:04:17,264 --> 00:04:18,196
That's good to hear.

80
00:04:18,198 --> 00:04:19,743
I want aces on this.

81
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:21,495
Everything perfect.

82
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:25,170
That's good to know.
I was gonna phone it in.

83

<i>Dr. Bender.</i>

85
00:04:30,778 --> 00:04:33,111
Is this the chairman's
version of a pep talk?

86
00:04:33,113 --> 00:04:36,014
I'm looking for a fail-safe
outcome on the procedure.

87
00:04:36,016 --> 00:04:40,319
I want you to use
Dr. Melendez as your second.

88
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:43,188
That's your fail-safe? Melendez?

89
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,890
I'm your Chief of Surgery.

90
00:04:44,892 --> 00:04:48,060
It's just a precaution to
guarantee a perfect outcome.

91
00:04:48,062 --> 00:04:49,328
Are you doubting my abilities?

92
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,929
Wannamaker is important.

93
00:04:51,733 --> 00:04:53,832
Everything has to be perfect.

94
00:04:53,834 --> 00:04:55,445
You said that already.

95
00:04:56,003 --> 00:04:57,970
I'm your fail-safe.

96
00:04:57,972 --> 00:04:59,771
The V.I.P. will be fine.

97
00:05:04,878 --> 00:05:06,206
How you doing?

98
00:05:06,814 --> 00:05:08,013
I know these sounds and everything

99
00:05:08,015 --> 00:05:09,047
might be a lot for you.

100
00:05:09,049 --> 00:05:11,116
It's... it's hard for anyone.

101
00:05:11,118 --> 00:05:13,046
I like helicopters.

102
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,955
I, uh, didn't know you'd
been on a helicopter.

103
00:05:16,957 --> 00:05:18,427
I haven't.

104
00:05:36,442 --> 00:05:40,412
15 minutes to San Francisco
Municipal Hospital.

105
00:05:40,414 --> 00:05:42,659
Should be a smooth ride.

106
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:05,307
You do know what this is, right?

107
00:06:05,939 --> 00:06:08,393
Well, I'll tell you what it is.
It's scut work.

108
00:06:09,376 --> 00:06:12,314
Jared gets the golden ticket,
and we get...

109
00:06:13,514 --> 00:06:15,514
pizza delivery.

110
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,490
The rotors just go
round and round, Shaun.

111
00:06:25,492 --> 00:06:26,900
They don't change.

112
00:06:42,843 --> 00:06:44,888
How do I talk to you?

113
00:06:47,747 --> 00:06:49,748
So, Chuck, any chest pains,
shortness of breath?

114
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,016
No.

115
00:06:51,018 --> 00:06:52,117
Any alcohol in the last six months?

116
00:06:52,119 --> 00:06:53,485
No.

117
00:06:53,487 --> 00:06:55,387
- Here comes a quick pinch.
- Any swelling in your limbs?

118
00:06:55,389 --> 00:06:57,856
It's Walmart on Black Friday in here.

119
00:06:57,858 --> 00:06:59,891
Things speed way up
when you're having a transplant.

120
00:06:59,893 --> 00:07:01,159
I like it.

121
00:07:01,161 --> 00:07:02,694
It's good energy.

122
00:07:02,696 --> 00:07:04,029
So, that's a "no" on the swelling?

123
00:07:04,031 --> 00:07:05,116
No.

124
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,301
I feel lousy all the time, pretty much.

125
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:13,972
But... I've got a second chance,
you know, with this liver.

126
00:07:13,974 --> 00:07:15,006
Sure.

127
00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:17,876
Oh! Excuse me. It's my daughter.

128
00:07:17,878 --> 00:07:19,311
I already spoke to Mom.

129
00:07:19,798 --> 00:07:21,646
A-And Uncle Tommy, too.

130
00:07:21,648 --> 00:07:24,552
Yeah, I need to see your face.

131
00:07:25,085 --> 00:07:26,485
All right.

132
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:27,719
I love you.

133
00:07:27,721 --> 00:07:29,121
Bye.

134
00:07:29,123 --> 00:07:31,523
She just graduated
from law school at Cal.

135
00:07:31,525 --> 00:07:32,824
I told you that.

136
00:07:32,826 --> 00:07:34,759
Uh, no. Congratulations.

137
00:07:34,761 --> 00:07:36,962
I must've told Dr. Browne, then.

138
00:07:36,964 --> 00:07:38,296
Where is Dr. Browne?

139
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:47,906
Here's your liver.

140
00:07:47,908 --> 00:07:49,174
I'm going to need you to sign for it.

141
00:07:49,176 --> 00:07:51,343
Standard operating procedure
is the leave the liver

142
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:52,511
in the safety of the body cavity.

143
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:53,912
I'm aware of the procedure.

144
00:07:53,914 --> 00:07:55,747
We had a John Doe
at the top of the registry,

145
00:07:55,749 --> 00:07:57,649
but that John Doe died
before we could plant.

146
00:07:57,651 --> 00:07:59,284
How long ago did you take it out?

147
00:07:59,286 --> 00:08:00,285
Three hours.

148
00:08:00,287 --> 00:08:02,053
We just lost three hours.

149
00:08:02,055 --> 00:08:04,489
Technically three hours
and five minutes.

150
00:08:04,491 --> 00:08:05,824
True clock is on the cooler.

151
00:08:05,826 --> 00:08:09,294
Can't go below 39 degrees
or above 47 degrees.

152
00:08:09,724 --> 00:08:11,266
You want to sign for it?

153
00:08:17,437 --> 00:08:19,149
Tissue looks healthy.

154
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:23,111
What are you doing?

155
00:08:24,077 --> 00:08:25,644
What are you looking for?

156
00:08:25,646 --> 00:08:28,013
- What's he doing?
- I'm not sure.

157
00:08:32,362 --> 00:08:34,362
_

158
00:08:34,387 --> 00:08:35,921
Shaun, what are you looking for?

159
00:08:35,923 --> 00:08:37,355
Masses? Cysts?

160
00:08:37,357 --> 00:08:38,657
They're clean.

161
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:40,158
You think we'd miss a tumor?

162
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,671
There's nothing there.

163
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,342
I know.

164
00:08:46,233 --> 00:08:48,099
There's nothing there.

165
00:08:48,101 --> 00:08:49,968
Okay, the liver needs
to go back into cold storage,

166
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:51,636
and we got to go.

167
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:58,343
...then I'll release the vascular clamp

168
00:08:58,345 --> 00:09:00,478
and let your blood perfuse
in your donor liver.

169
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,080
- That's it?
- Connect the bile ducts,

170
00:09:02,082 --> 00:09:03,615
sew you up, and then we wait.

171
00:09:03,617 --> 00:09:05,817
Does the new one always take?

172
00:09:05,819 --> 00:09:07,919
Over 70% of the time.

173
00:09:07,921 --> 00:09:09,454
Oh, I can live with those odds.

174
00:09:11,158 --> 00:09:12,357
You get some rest.

175
00:09:12,359 --> 00:09:13,787
See you later.

176
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:16,795
He looks at something.
I don't know what he's looking at.

177
00:09:16,797 --> 00:09:18,396
Is he, you know, is... is he curious?

178
00:09:18,398 --> 00:09:19,965
Is he concerned? He won't answer me.

179
00:09:19,967 --> 00:09:22,267
<i>You're having trouble
communicating with him.</i>

180
00:09:22,269 --> 00:09:24,035
It's a weekday. It's Shaun.

181
00:09:24,037 --> 00:09:26,004
Hm, let's see. That seems about right.

182
00:09:26,006 --> 00:09:27,772
He seemed different at the hospital.

183
00:09:27,774 --> 00:09:29,908
I could kind of talk to him.

184
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:32,177
<i>Well, he knows what
to expect in the hospital.</i>

185
00:09:32,179 --> 00:09:33,945
Outside, everything's different.
Everything's new.

186
00:09:33,947 --> 00:09:34,879
New stimuli.

187
00:09:34,881 --> 00:09:36,214
So, what do I do?

188
00:09:36,216 --> 00:09:37,515
I-I... I don't know what he's thinking.

189
00:09:37,517 --> 00:09:39,684
Claire, you're not gonna
figure out what he's thinking,

190
00:09:39,686 --> 00:09:40,986
so don't even try.

191
00:09:40,988 --> 00:09:42,954
In fact, if he's thinking
about something in his own mind,

192
00:09:42,956 --> 00:09:44,322
just let him be.

193
00:09:44,324 --> 00:09:46,124
I'd appreciate it if people
gave me the same courtesy.

194
00:09:46,126 --> 00:09:47,626
I thought with your history...

195
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:49,294
<i>Claire, if you want to connect with him,</i>

196
00:09:49,296 --> 00:09:51,991
you're gonna have to
figure out your own way in.

197
00:09:52,966 --> 00:09:53,898
How's Chuck?

198
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,933
<i>Chuck? Chuck's fine.</i>

199
00:09:54,935 --> 00:09:56,334
<i>He's waiting for a liver.</i>

200
00:09:56,336 --> 00:09:58,103
<i>So come home, please.</i>

201
00:09:58,105 --> 00:09:59,165
Okay.

202
00:10:02,808 --> 00:10:04,476
Doctor.

203
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:05,510
What's up?

204
00:10:05,512 --> 00:10:07,545
I just wanted to thank you.

205
00:10:07,547 --> 00:10:08,813
I haven't done anything yet.

206
00:10:08,815 --> 00:10:10,148
You have.

207
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:12,350
You've given my dad hope.

208
00:10:16,255 --> 00:10:17,989
_

209
00:10:17,991 --> 00:10:19,958
You know, Chuck was my first patient.

210
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,560
Six months ago,
first day at St. Bonaventure,

211
00:10:22,562 --> 00:10:23,828
I get a liver failure.

212
00:10:24,482 --> 00:10:27,198
And the nicest guy in the world.

213
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,134
I wanted to be the one
to give him the good news.

214
00:10:29,136 --> 00:10:30,780
We're not leaving.

215
00:10:32,472 --> 00:10:34,039
You said you liked helicopters.

216
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:35,807
We are not leaving.

217
00:10:35,809 --> 00:10:37,876
We... We made it here safe.

218
00:10:37,878 --> 00:10:40,211
Yes, we are not leaving.

219
00:10:40,213 --> 00:10:42,013
We're not leaving.

220
00:10:42,015 --> 00:10:44,169
Fog's rolling in too quick.

221
00:10:45,319 --> 00:10:48,086
Does that mean it rolls out quick?

222
00:10:48,088 --> 00:10:49,587
Could be an hour. Could be three.

223
00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:50,925
Don't know.

224
00:10:52,459 --> 00:10:55,363
Okay, uh... We're gonna need a new ride.

225
00:10:56,831 --> 00:10:59,180
Excuse me! I need
an ambulance to St. Bonaventure.

226
00:10:59,182 --> 00:11:01,009
Sorry. I just don't have the EMS.

227
00:11:01,056 --> 00:11:03,733
I've got a pile-up on I-80 and
four other vehicles out on call.

228
00:11:03,735 --> 00:11:05,192
Not one ambulance?

229
00:11:09,964 --> 00:11:11,431
Let me be clear... this is emergent.

230
00:11:11,433 --> 00:11:12,598
It's time sensitive.

231
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,233
Honey, this ain't Hertz.

232
00:11:17,171 --> 00:11:18,938
What about a police escort?

233
00:11:20,908 --> 00:11:22,624
That can be arranged.

234
00:11:29,184 --> 00:11:30,316
Of course.

235
00:11:30,318 --> 00:11:32,218
Don't want to ruin the festivities.

236
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:35,588
But if I could just get a few
minutes with my patient, alone.

237
00:11:38,726 --> 00:11:41,094
Mr. Wannamaker.

238
00:11:42,162 --> 00:11:44,229
Dr. Andrews.

239
00:11:45,999 --> 00:11:47,400
How we doing today?

240
00:11:47,402 --> 00:11:49,035
Incomplete.

241
00:11:49,037 --> 00:11:52,038
Let's see what we can do about that.

242
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,738
Look here.

243
00:11:54,743 --> 00:11:58,177
Well, looking not too bad
considering we cut out a tumor

244
00:11:58,179 --> 00:11:59,479
less than two weeks ago.

245
00:11:59,481 --> 00:12:02,815
Yeah, I've been walking around
with a hole in my mouth.

246
00:12:02,817 --> 00:12:05,752
Ever drink Scotch with
a hole in your mouth?

247
00:12:05,754 --> 00:12:07,420
Waste of good Scotch.

248
00:12:07,422 --> 00:12:10,223
We needed to give it time to heal.

249
00:12:10,225 --> 00:12:12,632
Yeah, yeah. You told me.

250
00:12:13,428 --> 00:12:15,695
Have you continued to smoke?

251
00:12:15,697 --> 00:12:19,031
It constricts the vessels,
slows the healing.

252
00:12:19,033 --> 00:12:21,000
I'm not a quitter.

253
00:12:23,437 --> 00:12:28,648
We are going to graft
some skin from your leg

254
00:12:29,377 --> 00:12:32,545
and fix that cheek up better than new.

255
00:12:32,547 --> 00:12:34,413
I'm a real estate guy.

256
00:12:34,415 --> 00:12:36,516
There's an old saying...
"You can have it fast.

257
00:12:36,518 --> 00:12:38,050
You can have it good.
You can have it cheap.

258
00:12:38,052 --> 00:12:40,186
Pick two."

259
00:12:40,188 --> 00:12:41,854
It's not gonna be cheap.

260
00:12:44,058 --> 00:12:46,592
I like doctors like you.

261
00:12:46,594 --> 00:12:48,761
You're good, and you know it.

262
00:12:51,632 --> 00:12:54,167
Yes. It was harvested
before we got there.

263
00:12:54,169 --> 00:12:55,935
We're waiting for transportation.

264
00:12:55,937 --> 00:12:58,437
The itinerary and the life clock
have changed.

265
00:12:58,439 --> 00:13:00,106
Yeah, uh... Four hours and 14 minutes.

266
00:13:00,108 --> 00:13:02,974
Excuse me! Are you
talking to the hospital?

267
00:13:03,344 --> 00:13:05,645
Have someone tell
Dr. Glassman that I might

268
00:13:05,647 --> 00:13:07,603
be late for our lunch, please.

269
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:10,416
Yeah. Okay.

270
00:13:16,825 --> 00:13:18,573
So, how did you know about the weather?

271
00:13:19,494 --> 00:13:21,159
Is it some kind of gift?

272
00:13:22,896 --> 00:13:25,431
Come on, I got to know.

273
00:13:25,433 --> 00:13:27,415
What, Shaun Murphy is Zeus?

274
00:13:28,169 --> 00:13:30,236
I watch The Weather Channel.

275
00:13:36,778 --> 00:13:38,444
You my doctors?

276
00:13:40,314 --> 00:13:41,681
Shaun?

277
00:13:41,683 --> 00:13:43,681
Shaun, we got to go!

278
00:14:02,136 --> 00:14:03,534
You're home.

279
00:14:04,439 --> 00:14:05,972
Your dad and mom have had a tough night

280
00:14:05,974 --> 00:14:07,580
with your brother and all.

281
00:14:08,776 --> 00:14:09,842
Come on. Let's go.

282
00:14:09,844 --> 00:14:12,645
No! No!

283
00:14:12,647 --> 00:14:15,047
He... He promised me!

284
00:14:15,049 --> 00:14:17,316
He... He promised me!

285
00:14:17,318 --> 00:14:19,719
He promised! He promised me!

286
00:14:19,721 --> 00:14:22,555
He promised me! He promised me!

287
00:14:28,897 --> 00:14:31,729
I think we'll get there much
quicker if we drive, Shaun.

288
00:14:37,804 --> 00:14:40,740
C-Could you turn off
the flashers, please?

289
00:14:50,951 --> 00:14:52,718
What's the patient's name?

290
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,020
I told you. It's Chuck.

291
00:14:54,022 --> 00:14:55,688
- No.
- No?

292
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:57,523
No. The... The donor?

293
00:14:57,525 --> 00:14:58,958
What's his name?

294
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,227
What? The liver?

295
00:15:01,229 --> 00:15:02,995
I...

296
00:15:02,997 --> 00:15:04,679
"Oliver"?

297
00:15:05,767 --> 00:15:07,333
Oliver.

298
00:15:17,411 --> 00:15:18,945
Hey, you got a second?

299
00:15:18,947 --> 00:15:20,146
What's up?

300
00:15:20,148 --> 00:15:21,948
Just waiting on a liver.

301
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:24,550
Transplant. Everyone wants in.

302
00:15:24,552 --> 00:15:27,118
They'd trade their liver
to do the liver.

303
00:15:27,555 --> 00:15:29,488
Hey, look, uh,

304
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:30,957
you want some help on this Free-Flap?

305
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:31,857
What's his name?

306
00:15:31,859 --> 00:15:33,247
- Wannamaker.
- Right.

307
00:15:33,249 --> 00:15:34,794
You got the transplant.

308
00:15:34,796 --> 00:15:36,395
That should keep any attending busy.

309
00:15:36,397 --> 00:15:38,497
Well, I can make time.

310
00:15:38,499 --> 00:15:40,132
Aoki come to you about this?

311
00:15:40,134 --> 00:15:41,634
Look, I get it. You're the Chief.

312
00:15:41,636 --> 00:15:42,868
That's right.

313
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:44,270
Look, this... this isn't a coup.

314
00:15:44,272 --> 00:15:45,511
What is it?

315
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,740
It's about making sure
this hospital is first

316
00:15:47,742 --> 00:15:49,241
on Wannamaker's donation list.

317
00:15:49,243 --> 00:15:50,910
I'm aware of the stakes.

318
00:15:51,475 --> 00:15:53,079
Thanks for coming by.

319
00:15:55,048 --> 00:15:57,350
You know, it doesn't make you
any less of a surgeon,

320
00:15:57,352 --> 00:15:58,884
having me in there as your second.

321
00:15:58,886 --> 00:16:00,353
I'm the Chief. You're my attending.

322
00:16:00,355 --> 00:16:01,754
Can't argue with that.

323
00:16:01,756 --> 00:16:04,357
And we both know what your
presence in my O.R. will say.

324
00:16:04,359 --> 00:16:05,891
That's not my intention.

325
00:16:05,893 --> 00:16:07,793
It's the impact.
Intention doesn't matter.

326
00:16:08,446 --> 00:16:11,297
Thanks... but I'm good.

327
00:16:25,178 --> 00:16:26,677
These can't be right.

328
00:16:27,682 --> 00:16:29,048
Whatever it is, it's right.

329
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,282
Chuck's labs.

330
00:16:30,284 --> 00:16:32,284
It's got to be a false flag
or a bad reading.

331
00:16:32,286 --> 00:16:33,319
For what?

332
00:16:33,321 --> 00:16:35,454
Medications? Foods? I don't know.

333
00:16:39,659 --> 00:16:41,776
Look, if this is right,
we lose our transplant.

334
00:16:42,296 --> 00:16:44,779
I'm sorry. That doesn't
change the results.

335
00:16:45,366 --> 00:16:47,406
There's alcohol in his system.

336
00:16:48,469 --> 00:16:49,802
He drank.

337
00:16:49,804 --> 00:16:51,704
The blood doesn't lie.

338
00:16:54,141 --> 00:16:55,775
Run the lab again.

339
00:16:59,079 --> 00:17:00,813
E.T.A. to St. Bonaventure?

340
00:17:00,815 --> 00:17:02,505
70 minutes.

341
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:10,596
What are you looking for?

342
00:17:11,192 --> 00:17:12,598
What do you see?

343
00:17:13,895 --> 00:17:15,594
I have a girl neighbor.

344
00:17:16,018 --> 00:17:17,596
Okay.

345
00:17:18,932 --> 00:17:20,523
Is she nice?

346
00:17:22,003 --> 00:17:25,027
What does she do?
Does she... have a boyfriend?

347
00:17:26,941 --> 00:17:28,823
Do you know her name?

348
00:17:34,781 --> 00:17:37,683
What the hell are you
looking for on the scans?

349
00:17:39,787 --> 00:17:40,820
What the...

350
00:17:40,822 --> 00:17:42,588
The temperature is going up!

351
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:45,762
Officer, we need to find
a place with ice, like, now!

352
00:17:48,532 --> 00:17:51,151
I tested it, Chuck. And re-tested it.

353
00:17:52,831 --> 00:17:54,028
Talk to me.

354
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,513
You know the six-month rule.

355
00:17:57,087 --> 00:17:59,228
- Was it a craving?
- It was three days ago.

356
00:18:00,457 --> 00:18:02,231
My daughter's graduation.

357
00:18:07,897 --> 00:18:10,932
Nobody in my family
had ever gone to college.

358
00:18:13,969 --> 00:18:15,437
There she was.

359
00:18:16,411 --> 00:18:20,314
My little girl wearing the robes.

360
00:18:22,445 --> 00:18:28,016
And for just that day,
I... I wanted to be normal.

361
00:18:30,586 --> 00:18:34,889
So, I... I had a glass of champagne.

362
00:18:38,061 --> 00:18:39,894
_

363
00:18:41,997 --> 00:18:43,298
You're out of ice?

364
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,467
It's broken. Supermarket's
about three miles down.

365
00:18:45,469 --> 00:18:47,135
We don't have time.

366
00:18:49,305 --> 00:18:51,039
Okay. Okay.

367
00:18:57,947 --> 00:18:59,981
The temperature's already at 47 degrees.

368
00:18:59,983 --> 00:19:01,549
We can't let it go any higher.

369
00:19:06,622 --> 00:19:08,690
Are you gonna help me?

370
00:19:10,025 --> 00:19:12,718
It's sweet. You'll like it.

371
00:19:25,075 --> 00:19:27,142
What should I do with him?

372
00:19:27,144 --> 00:19:29,978
Child Services is down in Cheyenne.

373
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:32,080
That's 150 miles,
and they'll just turn me around

374
00:19:32,082 --> 00:19:33,982
and send me back to the parents.

375
00:19:33,984 --> 00:19:35,866
The parents don't want him?

376
00:19:36,853 --> 00:19:38,286
I don't know.

377
00:19:38,288 --> 00:19:41,122
He doesn't seem to want
the parents, that's for sure.

378
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:43,291
You can take him to do the hospital.

379
00:19:43,293 --> 00:19:44,708
Social worker there.

380
00:19:50,432 --> 00:19:52,049
That won't work.

381
00:19:52,903 --> 00:19:54,169
How do you know?

382
00:19:54,171 --> 00:19:55,553
Shaun?

383
00:19:58,207 --> 00:20:00,224
You're right. It's not working! Why?

384
00:20:01,144 --> 00:20:02,268
Shaun!

385
00:20:02,913 --> 00:20:04,846
Are you even listening to me?!

386
00:20:04,848 --> 00:20:05,980
Just one drink?

387
00:20:05,982 --> 00:20:07,481
That's what he said.

388
00:20:08,652 --> 00:20:10,568
Should I inform the registry?

389
00:20:11,054 --> 00:20:12,954
How long ago did Chuck have that drink?

390
00:20:12,956 --> 00:20:14,389
Three days ago.

391
00:20:14,391 --> 00:20:15,957
Give me your marker.

392
00:20:23,966 --> 00:20:25,458
That's...

393
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:30,004
Estimated blood-alcohol content.

394
00:20:32,141 --> 00:20:33,708
What type of alcohol?

395
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:35,243
Uh, champagne.

396
00:20:35,245 --> 00:20:36,511
What percentage of alcohol is that?

397
00:20:36,513 --> 00:20:37,679
I don't know. What's the difference?

398
00:20:37,681 --> 00:20:39,263
Take out your phone and look it up.

399
00:20:40,817 --> 00:20:42,951
I don't know why it's not working!

400
00:20:42,953 --> 00:20:45,553
It needs to be submerged to cool.

401
00:21:00,804 --> 00:21:04,572
Hey! Every five seconds is an XL.

402
00:21:04,574 --> 00:21:08,000
Why did you answer me the last
time, but not before?

403
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:11,045
Was it because I was angry?

404
00:21:12,282 --> 00:21:13,982
Was it random?

405
00:21:13,984 --> 00:21:16,258
Why can't you answer my questions?

406
00:21:21,056 --> 00:21:22,657
This better work.

407
00:21:22,659 --> 00:21:24,225
It will work.

408
00:21:26,609 --> 00:21:29,344
You answer when I don't ask.

409
00:21:32,501 --> 00:21:34,002
You don't like questions.

410
00:21:34,004 --> 00:21:35,803
I don't.

411
00:21:42,344 --> 00:21:43,978
I didn't do well in calculus.

412
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,580
This is algebra.

413
00:21:45,582 --> 00:21:48,516
With his severe cirrhosis,
his alcohol-clearance rate

414
00:21:48,518 --> 00:21:51,085
is one milligram per deciliter per hour.

415
00:21:53,823 --> 00:21:55,857
One drink, say eight ounces...

416
00:21:55,859 --> 00:21:57,225
If it's champagne, six ounces, tops.

417
00:21:57,227 --> 00:21:58,293
Play it conservative.

418
00:21:58,295 --> 00:22:01,229
Eight ounces results
in a blood alcohol level

419
00:22:01,231 --> 00:22:03,765
of 39 milligrams per deciliter.

420
00:22:03,767 --> 00:22:05,933
One standard drink.

421
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:10,038
Now, the purpose of abstinence,

422
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,640
at least according to
the transplant registry is...

423
00:22:12,642 --> 00:22:13,941
Patients who kill their livers

424
00:22:13,943 --> 00:22:16,151
due to excessive drinking
prove they can be sober.

425
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,363
Let me see that report.

426
00:22:20,183 --> 00:22:22,116
0.02.

427
00:22:23,453 --> 00:22:25,286
Chuck was telling the truth.

428
00:22:25,288 --> 00:22:26,921
He did have just the one drink.

429
00:22:26,923 --> 00:22:28,389
He didn't fall off the wagon.

430
00:22:28,391 --> 00:22:30,207
Corporate loves its data.

431
00:22:30,593 --> 00:22:32,560
I'm not sure it'll
actually make a difference,

432
00:22:32,562 --> 00:22:34,879
but it does give us an argument.

433
00:22:36,392 --> 00:22:38,526
You are genius.

434
00:22:50,612 --> 00:22:52,547
You don't like the cafeteria food?

435
00:22:52,549 --> 00:22:54,349
They only make one thing well.

436
00:22:54,351 --> 00:22:55,750
What does it say when the staff sees

437
00:22:55,752 --> 00:22:58,553
the President of the hospital
not eating their cafeteria food?

438
00:22:58,555 --> 00:23:00,922
Well, it says
the President of the hospital

439
00:23:00,924 --> 00:23:02,781
isn't allowed in the kitchen.

440
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,493
You sat down. What can I do for you?

441
00:23:05,993 --> 00:23:07,536
I'd like your advice.

442
00:23:07,538 --> 00:23:08,579
Really?

443
00:23:08,852 --> 00:23:10,873
Where's Aoki? Did she die?

444
00:23:11,601 --> 00:23:12,867
This was a mistake.

445
00:23:12,869 --> 00:23:14,535
That's insulting. Sit down.

446
00:23:14,537 --> 00:23:16,003
At least hear what I have to say,

447
00:23:16,005 --> 00:23:17,905
and then decide it's bad advice.

448
00:23:17,907 --> 00:23:19,298
Sit.

449
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:23,878
Aoki is pushing Melendez
on me for the VIP.

450
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,880
Ah. You didn't get the e-mail blast.

451
00:23:25,882 --> 00:23:28,383
Rich people aren't allowed
to die in this hospital.

452
00:23:28,385 --> 00:23:30,184
You're not the young star anymore.

453
00:23:30,186 --> 00:23:31,386
Melendez is.

454
00:23:31,388 --> 00:23:32,754
I know that.

455
00:23:32,756 --> 00:23:34,389
And you're upset about the "why"?

456
00:23:34,391 --> 00:23:36,324
Why does Aoki think that?

457
00:23:36,326 --> 00:23:37,558
You should be asking "who".

458
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,772
"Who"? I know who. Melendez.

459
00:23:39,774 --> 00:23:41,070
Who are <i>you?</i>

460
00:23:41,598 --> 00:23:43,531
Are you a Chief who wants to be surgeon,

461
00:23:43,533 --> 00:23:45,767
or are you a Chief
who wants to be president?

462
00:23:45,769 --> 00:23:48,002
'Cause if it's the latter,
take your ego,

463
00:23:48,004 --> 00:23:49,437
shove it in a cupboard somewhere,

464
00:23:49,439 --> 00:23:52,039
and start acting presidential.

465
00:24:02,284 --> 00:24:04,085
Dr. Melendez is going
to argue to the board

466
00:24:04,087 --> 00:24:05,286
that you get this liver.

467
00:24:05,288 --> 00:24:06,762
And I think it's a pretty good argument.

468
00:24:07,824 --> 00:24:09,431
Do I deserve it?

469
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,309
I'm... not sure that's relevant.

470
00:24:15,731 --> 00:24:16,855
You know...

471
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,066
when you're dying,

472
00:24:19,636 --> 00:24:22,361
and I've been dying for a long time,

473
00:24:23,573 --> 00:24:26,340
you start to think about your life.

474
00:24:28,844 --> 00:24:30,577
I haven't led a great one.

475
00:24:32,115 --> 00:24:33,872
I could've been a better dad.

476
00:24:34,984 --> 00:24:36,500
A better man.

477
00:24:38,921 --> 00:24:42,923
News flash... I drank too much.

478
00:24:43,426 --> 00:24:45,384
You know, I also have a son.

479
00:24:46,062 --> 00:24:48,637
Yeah. First marriage.

480
00:24:49,812 --> 00:24:52,179
I haven't seen him in three years.

481
00:24:53,836 --> 00:24:56,471
Getting a liver is not a second chance,

482
00:24:56,473 --> 00:24:58,439
and it's not a reward for being perfect.

483
00:24:59,008 --> 00:25:00,566
It's just what we can do.

484
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:02,359
Maybe.

485
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,404
But on the registry,

486
00:25:05,715 --> 00:25:08,449
all of us wait in line together.

487
00:25:09,486 --> 00:25:13,187
And I see these...

488
00:25:13,189 --> 00:25:16,557
these people here, waiting.

489
00:25:18,227 --> 00:25:20,127
I know their faces.

490
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:22,629
Even their names.

491
00:25:23,399 --> 00:25:25,257
They all have stories.

492
00:25:26,536 --> 00:25:28,302
We're in it together.

493
00:25:29,672 --> 00:25:31,054
And I...

494
00:25:32,475 --> 00:25:33,774
I broke the...

495
00:25:35,578 --> 00:25:37,394
Chuck? Chuck!

496
00:25:37,881 --> 00:25:39,213
Chuck? Code blue!

497
00:25:39,215 --> 00:25:40,448
Chuck, can you hear me?

498
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,963
All right.

499
00:25:54,095 --> 00:25:56,997
He's got blood in his esophagus.

500
00:25:56,999 --> 00:25:58,432
He's got a variceal bleed.

501
00:25:58,434 --> 00:26:01,435
All right. Saline wide open.
Type and cross four units.

502
00:26:03,371 --> 00:26:05,631
I'm going to band the vein.

503
00:26:16,485 --> 00:26:18,310
Pressure's coming up.

504
00:26:38,441 --> 00:26:39,506
Chuck had a variceal bleed.

505
00:26:39,508 --> 00:26:40,507
I was in there.

506
00:26:40,509 --> 00:26:41,642
Portal hypertension, decompensated...

507
00:26:41,644 --> 00:26:43,076
Are you finished?

508
00:26:43,585 --> 00:26:46,213
He's got three months to live, maybe.

509
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:49,349
You have to be six-months alcohol free

510
00:26:49,351 --> 00:26:50,984
before you're registry eligible.

511
00:26:50,986 --> 00:26:53,454
And you said you weren't good at math.

512
00:26:55,457 --> 00:26:57,641
He gets this one or he dies.

513
00:27:04,409 --> 00:27:06,409
_

514
00:27:06,568 --> 00:27:08,702
You know what this thing
looks like at 8:00 A.M.?

515
00:27:08,704 --> 00:27:11,104
I need a police escort
to work every morning.

516
00:27:11,106 --> 00:27:12,940
280 South.

517
00:27:12,942 --> 00:27:14,408
Where are all roads meet.

518
00:27:17,846 --> 00:27:20,080
No, they don't!

519
00:27:29,506 --> 00:27:32,826
- What's wrong with him?
- He's autistic, officer.

520
00:27:32,828 --> 00:27:34,344
What's that mean?

521
00:27:34,763 --> 00:27:36,396
Does he need to be in a hospital?

522
00:27:36,398 --> 00:27:38,832
The last place he should
be is a hospital.

523
00:28:01,357 --> 00:28:03,206
What are you doing?

524
00:28:03,859 --> 00:28:05,459
Shaun?

525
00:28:05,461 --> 00:28:07,327
What are you thinking?

526
00:28:13,202 --> 00:28:14,835
Okay, this isn't a question.

527
00:28:14,837 --> 00:28:17,871
I just... I don't know what
you're looking for, Shaun.

528
00:28:17,873 --> 00:28:20,240
Yes, I can feel it. It's firmer.

529
00:28:20,242 --> 00:28:21,850
And?

530
00:28:23,112 --> 00:28:24,578
I don't know what that means.

531
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:26,647
There must be a clot,
but there isn't a clot.

532
00:28:26,649 --> 00:28:28,782
The scan showed no clot.

533
00:28:36,858 --> 00:28:39,693
That's because the scans
were taken before

534
00:28:39,695 --> 00:28:41,194
they harvested the liver.

535
00:28:41,196 --> 00:28:43,797
Prior to the liver being
flushed with UW solution!

536
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:44,932
It's dying!

537
00:28:44,934 --> 00:28:46,567
To preserve the liver,
they replace all its blood

538
00:28:46,569 --> 00:28:48,502
with a solution to protect
it from the cold storage,

539
00:28:48,504 --> 00:28:50,504
but they must've left some
blood behind, which clotted.

540
00:28:50,506 --> 00:28:52,272
How long to St. Bonaventure?

541
00:28:52,274 --> 00:28:54,207
- Less than 30 minutes.
- Can't wait!

542
00:28:54,209 --> 00:28:56,810
We have to immediately remove
the clot and flush the left lobe

543
00:28:56,812 --> 00:28:58,312
to protect it from the ice bath.

544
00:28:58,314 --> 00:28:59,513
We need to stop the car.

545
00:28:59,515 --> 00:29:00,847
- Here?
- Yes. Yes.

546
00:29:00,849 --> 00:29:02,482
We need to operate
right here, right now.

547
00:29:18,167 --> 00:29:19,600
Flush this from the right.

548
00:29:19,602 --> 00:29:21,001
So, the left lobe,

549
00:29:21,003 --> 00:29:22,869
starting at the middle hepatic vein.

550
00:29:22,871 --> 00:29:26,173
Less intrusive cut would be
along the falciform ligament

551
00:29:26,175 --> 00:29:27,874
to allow access to Segment III.

552
00:29:27,876 --> 00:29:30,811
When you locate the blockage,
I'm gonna have to remove it.

553
00:29:55,471 --> 00:29:56,937
Okay.

554
00:29:56,939 --> 00:29:59,773
I need a straw to cannulate
the vein, please.

555
00:29:59,775 --> 00:30:01,341
There's a straw in my cup.

556
00:30:09,351 --> 00:30:12,419
UW solution will stabilize
the cell walls.

557
00:30:12,421 --> 00:30:15,922
Preserve the integrity of the organ.

558
00:30:30,906 --> 00:30:33,040
This is better than having
a baby in my car.

559
00:30:38,327 --> 00:30:39,761
How are you feeling?

560
00:30:39,763 --> 00:30:42,330
Like I'm writing a blank check.

561
00:30:42,332 --> 00:30:43,865
You're gonna be fine.

562
00:30:43,867 --> 00:30:45,533
You're the best.

563
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:56,177
This bleed, these varices...
this isn't good news.

564
00:30:56,179 --> 00:31:00,081
Tells us that your liver failure
has progressed considerably.

565
00:31:00,467 --> 00:31:02,052
How much?

566
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:04,095
You have two to three months.

567
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,888
We're getting
the liver today, in an hour.

568
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:08,099
I don't get it.

569
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:10,758
You didn't tell them.

570
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,770
What?

571
00:31:12,629 --> 00:31:14,231
Your father had a drink.

572
00:31:15,398 --> 00:31:17,965
He had one glass.

573
00:31:17,967 --> 00:31:20,435
Transplant registry doesn't
quantify things like that.

574
00:31:20,437 --> 00:31:22,270
So he doesn't get the liver?

575
00:31:22,272 --> 00:31:23,905
I'm gonna try and get it for him.

576
00:31:23,907 --> 00:31:25,473
What are you, a car salesman?

577
00:31:25,475 --> 00:31:26,774
What, you're gonna try?

578
00:31:26,776 --> 00:31:28,776
The final decision is out of my hands.

579
00:31:33,416 --> 00:31:35,085
And if you fail?

580
00:31:35,652 --> 00:31:37,952
I'm gonna do everything that I can.

581
00:31:38,713 --> 00:31:41,189
I am meeting with
the committee in 10 minutes.

582
00:31:43,459 --> 00:31:44,928
Excuse me.

583
00:31:50,566 --> 00:31:52,686
I handed my dad the drink.

584
00:31:53,169 --> 00:31:55,203
Doesn't matter how it happened.

585
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:58,106
He didn't want it.
He just wanted to make me happy.

586
00:31:58,108 --> 00:32:01,242
If you let him die,
I will have killed my father.

587
00:32:29,139 --> 00:32:30,505
It was a glass.

588
00:32:30,507 --> 00:32:32,907
A glass of champagne
at his daughter's graduation.

589
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:34,475
I have the labs to prove it.

590
00:32:34,477 --> 00:32:35,710
Chuck didn't fall off the wagon.

591
00:32:35,712 --> 00:32:37,712
He had one drink and never went back.

592
00:32:37,714 --> 00:32:39,447
The transplant registry
guidelines don't play

593
00:32:39,449 --> 00:32:41,115
in the gray for a reason.

594
00:32:41,117 --> 00:32:42,350
Those guidelines are so arbitrary.

595
00:32:42,352 --> 00:32:43,718
Have one drink and you die.

596
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,620
A couple pills of ecstasy, no problem.

597
00:32:45,622 --> 00:32:48,356
Hepatitis B from careless
sexual practice, nope.

598
00:32:48,358 --> 00:32:49,557
Nothing at all about that.

599
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:51,359
So, what do you want us to do?
Throw out the rules?

600
00:32:51,361 --> 00:32:53,327
I want us not to hide behind them.

601
00:32:53,329 --> 00:32:55,429
We do have a responsibility.

602
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:57,398
Without the rules, we're playing God.

603
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,533
We need the rules.

604
00:32:58,535 --> 00:33:00,168
Does that help you
sleep better at night?

605
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:02,672
Yes, it does.

606
00:33:03,206 --> 00:33:07,542
We have one liver today, and 800
people in this state need it.

607
00:33:07,544 --> 00:33:09,777
I don't want to be haunted
by the other 799.

608
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:11,445
Your guy hasn't earned it.

609
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:13,141
He knew the rules, and this...

610
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:15,616
it's a technicality.

611
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:17,418
No, the drink is a technicality.

612
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:19,120
Jessica, what's the legal burden here?

613
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,321
Significant.

614
00:33:20,323 --> 00:33:21,923
If we move forward with this transplant,

615
00:33:21,925 --> 00:33:24,892
we could lose privileges
from the registry.

616
00:33:24,894 --> 00:33:26,961
- If it were discovered.
- If it were discovered?

617
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:29,030
How narrow can you be about this?

618
00:33:29,032 --> 00:33:31,532
Dr. Glassman, where are you on this?

619
00:33:31,534 --> 00:33:33,601
I can make a good argument either way.

620
00:33:33,603 --> 00:33:35,136
Go ahead, please.

621
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:37,738
Better to remove
the arguments all together.

622
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,340
What the hell is he talking about?

623
00:33:39,342 --> 00:33:41,409
All I'm talking about
is that we have a patient

624
00:33:41,411 --> 00:33:43,411
in this hospital who needs a liver.

625
00:33:43,413 --> 00:33:46,447
We also just happen to have
a liver that needs a patient.

626
00:33:46,449 --> 00:33:47,682
It's not that simple.

627
00:33:47,684 --> 00:33:50,218
It is that simple if you
consider the patient.

628
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:51,971
Rules are secondary.

629
00:33:52,689 --> 00:33:56,224
But is saving this patient
worth the risk

630
00:33:56,226 --> 00:33:58,526
of not being able
to save hundreds of others?

631
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:00,428
I don't have hundreds
of patients right now.

632
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:02,797
I have one, and his name is Chuck.

633
00:34:06,528 --> 00:34:08,035
Blood pressure's steady.

634
00:34:08,037 --> 00:34:10,004
Donor vessel to the facial artery,

635
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:11,472
and we're ready to close him up.

636
00:34:11,474 --> 00:34:13,908
10-0 polypropylene and vascular forceps.

637
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:15,787
Nice work, Dr. Andrews.

638
00:34:18,914 --> 00:34:20,375
What do we have here?

639
00:34:21,818 --> 00:34:23,184
Uh... hematoma?

640
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:25,253
I can see that. Let's find its source.

641
00:34:25,255 --> 00:34:27,154
Sponge, stick, and probe.

642
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:33,728
It's not my recipient artery.

643
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:35,229
Heart rate is dropping.

644
00:34:35,231 --> 00:34:37,098
Whatever it is,
it's compressing his carotid.

645
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,978
I can't get deep enough here.
I need better access.

646
00:34:41,771 --> 00:34:43,771
We move through zone three
from the outside.

647
00:34:43,773 --> 00:34:45,273
Zone three's a minefield.

648
00:34:45,275 --> 00:34:47,241
I'm aware, but we need to do this.

649
00:34:47,243 --> 00:34:48,709
Whatever you're gonna do, do it quick.

650
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:50,878
It's strangling him from the inside.

651
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:55,716
Get me Melendez.

652
00:34:56,652 --> 00:34:59,253
_

653
00:34:59,255 --> 00:35:00,821
We made it!

654
00:35:00,823 --> 00:35:03,157
Yeah, we're here.

655
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:04,925
Downstairs, coming up.

656
00:35:04,927 --> 00:35:08,195
No, no, no. Jared, you're not
gonna believe wh...

657
00:35:08,197 --> 00:35:09,997
Yeah?

658
00:35:17,774 --> 00:35:19,058
Got it.

659
00:35:26,015 --> 00:35:30,251
Um... Chuck's been moved
to the bottom of the list.

660
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:33,154
San Jose Presbyterian
are coming to get the liver.

661
00:35:38,677 --> 00:35:41,636
- Oxygen sats tanking.
- Up him to 100 % O2.

662
00:35:41,697 --> 00:35:43,163
You have to go through
the mandible from the inside

663
00:35:43,165 --> 00:35:45,699
to probe for the source.
It's the only way.

664
00:35:46,085 --> 00:35:47,462
Loops.

665
00:35:47,903 --> 00:35:51,538
We have to be careful in there,
or he'll get a stroke.

666
00:35:52,133 --> 00:35:54,427
We'll just have to be careful then.

667
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,927
Give Dr. Melendez
the mandibular channel retractor

668
00:35:57,929 --> 00:35:59,413
and number five bone cutter.

669
00:35:59,442 --> 00:36:01,175
Number five bone cutter.

670
00:36:16,054 --> 00:36:17,898
29 minutes. That's a lifetime.

671
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,855
Thank you. This is amazing.

672
00:36:19,857 --> 00:36:21,201
Got to go. The whole team is waiting.

673
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,370
His name is Oliver.

674
00:36:37,095 --> 00:36:39,086
It was a good day.

675
00:36:41,474 --> 00:36:43,434
We saved a life...

676
00:36:44,564 --> 00:36:46,193
just not Chuck's.

677
00:37:12,714 --> 00:37:14,121
It's not your fault.

678
00:37:14,674 --> 00:37:16,323
I want to believe that.

679
00:38:05,874 --> 00:38:07,507
Hi!

680
00:38:07,925 --> 00:38:09,116
Hello.

681
00:38:09,118 --> 00:38:11,652
Are you a lab guy or something?

682
00:38:11,654 --> 00:38:13,551
- I'm a surgeon.
- That's insane.

683
00:38:13,553 --> 00:38:15,651
May I have my batteries back?

684
00:38:17,299 --> 00:38:18,552
The ones you borrowed.

685
00:38:20,907 --> 00:38:22,456
Yeah.

686
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:29,529
There you go.

687
00:38:33,669 --> 00:38:35,602
What's your name?

688
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:37,013
I'm Lea.

689
00:38:37,015 --> 00:38:38,805
I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy. Nice to meet you.

690
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:11,398
You'll stay with me tonight.

691
00:40:13,644 --> 00:40:16,503
And tomorrow, we'll figure out the rest.

692
00:41:07,146 --> 00:41:11,366
