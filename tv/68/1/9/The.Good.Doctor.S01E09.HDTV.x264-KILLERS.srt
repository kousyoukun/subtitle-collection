1
00:00:04,313 --> 00:00:05,612
Very nice meeting you.

2
00:00:09,284 --> 00:00:13,053
So, who was that?

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,899
A housekeeper.

4
00:00:14,924 --> 00:00:17,091
Leaving your place
at 7:00 in the morning?

5
00:00:17,093 --> 00:00:18,492
I was interviewing her.

6
00:00:18,494 --> 00:00:20,649
You're hiring a housekeeper
for a studio apartment?

7
00:00:20,696 --> 00:00:21,895
I'm not hiring her.

8
00:00:21,897 --> 00:00:23,397
Her clothes don't match.

9
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:24,664
Right.

10
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:25,932
Mm.

11
00:00:28,469 --> 00:00:30,470
You're such an asshat, Shaun Murphy.

12
00:00:38,647 --> 00:00:41,081
Today we realize a dream...

13
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:43,650
seeing our international
humanitarian program

14
00:00:43,652 --> 00:00:44,885
come to fruition.

15
00:00:44,887 --> 00:00:48,088
Our cardiothoracic surgeon,
Dr. Neil Melendez,

16
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,626
in consultation with our head
cardiologist, Dr. Avi Mehta,

17
00:00:52,628 --> 00:00:57,097
evaluated children from Tanzania
to Malawi to Guinea.

18
00:00:57,099 --> 00:00:59,332
They screened over 100 candidates,

19
00:00:59,361 --> 00:01:01,445
each of them
needing life-saving surgeries.

20
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:04,404
Ultimately, we decided on a
particularly inspiring young boy

21
00:01:04,406 --> 00:01:05,650
named Gabriel,

22
00:01:05,651 --> 00:01:08,285
who hails from the
Democratic Republic of Congo,

23
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,377
with severe congenital heart anomalies.

24
00:01:12,648 --> 00:01:14,714
We identified
three perfect candidates...

25
00:01:14,716 --> 00:01:16,216
- children I can actually help.
- Hi. Thank you.

26
00:01:16,218 --> 00:01:18,251
- Gabriel wasn't one of them.
- Yes and no.

27
00:01:18,253 --> 00:01:19,786
I signed off on your choices.

28
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,588
But I wouldn't have
necessarily eliminated Gabriel

29
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:22,989
based on the echo I saw.

30
00:01:22,991 --> 00:01:24,491
A non-surgeon undermining a surgeon

31
00:01:24,493 --> 00:01:26,359
on his selection of surgical candidates.

32
00:01:26,361 --> 00:01:29,329
It's healthy when colleagues challenge
each others' decisions.

33
00:01:29,331 --> 00:01:30,430
It doesn't make any sense.

34
00:01:30,432 --> 00:01:31,698
We gave you good candidates.

35
00:01:31,723 --> 00:01:34,835
You're not a doctor.
Why wouldn't you stick with the list?

36
00:01:34,837 --> 00:01:37,604
There were several intangibles.

37
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:41,942
Can you say hi to Dr. Melendez?

38
00:01:41,944 --> 00:01:45,745
One of those intangibles,
I'm guessing, is cuteness.

39
00:01:47,737 --> 00:01:53,118

40
00:01:57,693 --> 00:01:59,860
Family displaced during the war.

41
00:01:59,862 --> 00:02:02,462
Mother took care of her husband
until he died of yellow fever.

42
00:02:02,464 --> 00:02:04,235
He bled out at home.

43
00:02:04,433 --> 00:02:06,566
A month later, Gabriel was born.

44
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:10,871
People tend to give more

45
00:02:10,873 --> 00:02:13,373
when the cause is not
only noble, but photogenic,

46
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:16,476
Adorable kids and sympathetic
moms may work on donors,

47
00:02:16,478 --> 00:02:17,711
but they won't work on me,

48
00:02:17,713 --> 00:02:19,579
and they certainly won't work
on echo results.

49
00:02:19,581 --> 00:02:21,381
Kinda working on me.

50
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:26,153
Before you say no,
at least do your own work-up.

51
00:02:32,627 --> 00:02:35,095
<i>Mommy, why can't I come?</i>

52
00:02:35,097 --> 00:02:37,764
The hospital's worried
that children bring in germs.

53
00:02:37,766 --> 00:02:39,533
<i>I won't, Mommy. I promise.</i>

54
00:02:39,535 --> 00:02:42,335
I know, boo.
It's just... It's the rules.

55
00:02:42,337 --> 00:02:44,004
Okay, baby. I have to go now.

56
00:02:44,006 --> 00:02:46,339
Do what Aunt Maggie says.
I'll call you later, okay?

57
00:02:46,341 --> 00:02:47,774
I love you to the moon...

58
00:02:47,776 --> 00:02:49,155
<i>And back.</i>

59
00:02:49,188 --> 00:02:50,287
I can't imagine voice rest

60
00:02:50,312 --> 00:02:51,578
could be very easy with a 3-year-old.

61
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,915
Yeah. Not very effective for
my podcast audience either.

62
00:02:54,917 --> 00:02:56,983
Of which, by the way, I'm a huge fan.

63
00:02:56,985 --> 00:02:59,286
Grim irony, though, right?

64
00:02:59,288 --> 00:03:01,188
A podcaster who loses her voice.

65
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:03,857
Elizabeth, I'm sure
the nodule will be benign

66
00:03:03,859 --> 00:03:05,425
and this'll be nothing more
than an inspiration

67
00:03:05,427 --> 00:03:06,593
for another great episode.

68
00:03:06,595 --> 00:03:08,495
If it's not benign, Isabel?

69
00:03:08,497 --> 00:03:09,701
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

70
00:03:09,726 --> 00:03:11,431
Today we're just focused
on removing the nodule

71
00:03:11,433 --> 00:03:12,499
and doing the biopsy.

72
00:03:12,501 --> 00:03:13,900
And you've done everything you could do.

73
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:15,068
And when the hoarseness started,

74
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,703
you sought early care from the best.

75
00:03:16,705 --> 00:03:17,737
And I sent you to the best.

76
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:20,058
You work perfectly together,

77
00:03:20,085 --> 00:03:21,752
kind of ping and pong-ish.

78
00:03:21,777 --> 00:03:23,343
It's nice.

79
00:03:23,345 --> 00:03:24,811
A lot of doctors who are married

80
00:03:24,813 --> 00:03:26,413
are more like miss and match.

81
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:31,084
Mrs. Bangura, this is
Dr. Murphy and Dr. Kalu.

82
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:33,019
They're gonna help me run
some tests on Gabriel.

83
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:35,422
I heard that you and Gabriel

84
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:36,756
have never been away from home before.

85
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,425
I was hoping that these
would make him feel welcome.

86
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:40,961
Yes. You are kind.

87
00:03:42,332 --> 00:03:45,106
I brought one for myself, too.

88
00:03:45,567 --> 00:03:48,101
Hey, how 'bout we all do some medicine?

89
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,074
AmericasCardroom.com brings poker back
Million Dollar Sunday Tournament every Sunday

90
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,083
He really needs our help.

91
00:04:09,524 --> 00:04:11,191
"He needs our help"?

92
00:04:11,193 --> 00:04:13,526
He sounds like he's got
a blow dryer in his chest.

93
00:04:13,528 --> 00:04:15,362
Exactly. Which is why he needs our help.

94
00:04:15,364 --> 00:04:16,730
This is the problem
with cardiologists...

95
00:04:16,732 --> 00:04:17,931
You're really good at telling people

96
00:04:17,933 --> 00:04:19,199
when something's broken,

97
00:04:19,201 --> 00:04:20,800
not so good at knowing
when they can't be fixed.

98
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:22,535
If that kid is dying, I'm not
gonna tell his mother that

99
00:04:22,537 --> 00:04:23,903
unless I'm damn sure.

100
00:04:23,905 --> 00:04:24,938
You heard that heart.

101
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:25,972
I heard that heart.

102
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:27,540
And it sounded like crap.

103
00:04:27,542 --> 00:04:29,476
But until we do a transesophageal echo,

104
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:31,478
I don't <i>know</i> anything.

105
00:04:39,021 --> 00:04:41,187
Do a transesophageal echo.

106
00:04:41,189 --> 00:04:43,590
She has a master's degree in Sociology,

107
00:04:43,592 --> 00:04:46,026
impeccable credentials,
excellent references,

108
00:04:46,028 --> 00:04:49,197
and you turned her away because
"her clothes didn't match"?

109
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:50,330
It's relevant.

110
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:53,667
If a life-skills coach can't
select a complementing wardrobe,

111
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:55,001
they lack life skills.

112
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,970
But she's not gonna pick out
your clothes for you.

113
00:04:56,972 --> 00:04:58,338
She's not a nanny.

114
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,895
She's there to help you
with problem-solving,

115
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:02,386
financial, social interactions.

116
00:05:02,411 --> 00:05:04,811
You're doing this
because I did not react well

117
00:05:04,813 --> 00:05:06,846
to a man with a gun
robbing a store I was in.

118
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:08,982
Statistically, that is very unlikely

119
00:05:08,984 --> 00:05:10,223
to ever happen to me again.

120
00:05:10,248 --> 00:05:11,885
Social interactions

121
00:05:11,887 --> 00:05:14,054
will happen again and again and again.

122
00:05:14,056 --> 00:05:16,256
It's statistically irrefutable.

123
00:05:16,258 --> 00:05:17,957
And if you learn how
to get along with people

124
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:19,626
a little bit better,
you'll have a fuller life.

125
00:05:19,628 --> 00:05:21,027
A happier life.

126
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,430
If you don't like this woman,
we'll find somebody else.

127
00:05:23,432 --> 00:05:24,464
I <i>am</i> happy.

128
00:05:24,466 --> 00:05:25,465
You could be happier.

129
00:05:25,467 --> 00:05:27,033
I don't think so.

130
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:30,303
My neighbor, Lea.

131
00:05:30,305 --> 00:05:33,306
If she were ever in a fire,
she'd be rescued first.

132
00:05:33,308 --> 00:05:34,674
Why's that?

133
00:05:34,676 --> 00:05:37,610
Dr. Melendez says attractive
people have advantages.

134
00:05:38,647 --> 00:05:40,447
Dr. Melendez says that, does he?

135
00:05:40,449 --> 00:05:41,681
Why is that funny?

136
00:05:41,683 --> 00:05:43,149
I don't know.

137
00:05:43,151 --> 00:05:44,851
It's just, um, some people

138
00:05:44,853 --> 00:05:47,954
consider Dr. Melendez attractive.

139
00:05:47,956 --> 00:05:50,023
So, how's it going with Lea?

140
00:05:50,858 --> 00:05:52,792
She doesn't like me.

141
00:05:52,794 --> 00:05:54,794
Why do you say that?

142
00:05:54,796 --> 00:05:58,163
- She said I was an asshat.
- Yeah?

143
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,033
What was she doing when she said that?

144
00:06:00,035 --> 00:06:03,036
Touching me. She was flirting with you.

145
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:06,406
Sometimes people say
the opposite of what they mean.

146
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:09,209
Um, they use teasing as a way

147
00:06:09,211 --> 00:06:10,710
of saying something they don't mean

148
00:06:10,712 --> 00:06:12,712
instead of saying something
that they do.

149
00:06:12,737 --> 00:06:15,606
I haven't seen any data
on the use of antonyms

150
00:06:15,617 --> 00:06:16,916
as a flirting technique.

151
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:19,958
Okay. Well, um, here's what to look for.

152
00:06:19,998 --> 00:06:21,365
- You ready?
- Yes.

153
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:23,356
Okay. The pretentious giggle.

154
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,494
The, uh... the squirm.

155
00:06:27,496 --> 00:06:29,596
And the hair sweep.

156
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:31,698
I call it the flirting trifecta.

157
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:35,301
Hair scuffing is used in both
animals and humans, Claire.

158
00:06:35,303 --> 00:06:38,104
Secreting glands are located
in the scalp and fur.

159
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,573
Scuffing sends hormones
out into the environment

160
00:06:40,575 --> 00:06:43,552
to let a potential mate
know they're interested.

161
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:45,111
Or it could be ringworm.

162
00:06:45,982 --> 00:06:47,180
Yeah.

163
00:06:47,182 --> 00:06:49,516
I suppose you have to factor
for that possibility.

164
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,220
Nice touch.

165
00:06:54,222 --> 00:06:55,588
Beauty increases happiness.

166
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:56,756
Happiness improves outlook.

167
00:06:56,758 --> 00:06:58,158
Still on Mission Carpe Diem.

168
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,659
You might want to try it.

169
00:06:59,661 --> 00:07:00,627
I'm doing fine.

170
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:02,061
We're having dinner at the sink.

171
00:07:02,063 --> 00:07:04,330
No, we're <i>enjoying</i> dinner at the sink.

172
00:07:04,332 --> 00:07:05,698
Although if you keep
talking like that...

173
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,500
Mm.

174
00:07:09,003 --> 00:07:11,301
Andrews.

175
00:07:11,573 --> 00:07:13,535
Well, look again. It has to be there.

176
00:07:14,342 --> 00:07:15,875
Yeah. Okay.

177
00:07:17,445 --> 00:07:18,545
Who was that?

178
00:07:18,547 --> 00:07:19,846
The lab.

179
00:07:19,848 --> 00:07:22,048
They misplaced Elizabeth's specimen.

180
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,750
- Oh, my God.
- Don't worry. They'll find it.

181
00:07:23,752 --> 00:07:26,052
Satisfied?

182
00:07:26,054 --> 00:07:28,121
- It's somewhere.
- Somewhere else.

183
00:07:28,123 --> 00:07:31,224
I love how everyone in surgery
is so fast to blame the lab.

184
00:07:31,226 --> 00:07:32,759
Well, double-checking can't hurt.

185
00:07:32,761 --> 00:07:33,827
Actually it can.

186
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:34,882
Because you are here

187
00:07:34,907 --> 00:07:36,440
when you should be
double-checking surgery.

188
00:07:36,465 --> 00:07:38,832
I saw the specimen go in the container.

189
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:40,200
It means it has to be here.

190
00:07:40,202 --> 00:07:43,036
No, all that means is that
it was put in a container.

191
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:44,237
It doesn't mean that that container

192
00:07:44,239 --> 00:07:45,972
was actually put
in the surgery refrigerator

193
00:07:45,974 --> 00:07:48,208
or that it was actually
picked up by the courier.

194
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:50,176
He's even worse than we thought.

195
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,778
Yeah.

196
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,214
Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy,

197
00:07:54,216 --> 00:07:55,815
atrial septal defect,

198
00:07:55,817 --> 00:07:58,351
abnormal insertion
of the mitral valve leaflet.

199
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:01,454
I've never seen so many
anomalies in one heart.

200
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:06,960
I'm sorry I pushed
for additional testing.

201
00:08:06,962 --> 00:08:09,471
That only got his mother's hopes up.

202
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:12,499
Any medication that'll help?

203
00:08:12,501 --> 00:08:14,267
Beta blockers.

204
00:08:14,269 --> 00:08:15,869
Maybe metoprolol.

205
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,470
It's not like they'll
get him playing soccer,

206
00:08:17,472 --> 00:08:19,539
but they might help him get
to the field to watch.

207
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,841
For a couple of years, anyway.

208
00:08:21,843 --> 00:08:25,022
Better than dying on a table tomorrow.

209
00:08:25,347 --> 00:08:27,714
You tell Aoki.

210
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:31,317
I'll break it to the mom.

211
00:08:36,334 --> 00:08:38,544
Dr. Lippman to plastic surgery.

212
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:40,837
Dr. Lippman to plastic surgery.

213
00:08:50,849 --> 00:08:55,585
It's called sakara, given by our shaman.

214
00:08:57,821 --> 00:08:59,734
His heartbeat...

215
00:09:00,025 --> 00:09:02,392
it follows the sound.

216
00:09:02,481 --> 00:09:06,182
It reminds it to beat until you fix it.

217
00:09:06,207 --> 00:09:09,909
Mrs. Bangura,
I've completed all the tests.

218
00:09:09,911 --> 00:09:11,577
And I'm sorry that you've
come all this way...

219
00:09:11,579 --> 00:09:15,975
When Gabriel was in my belly,
evil spirits came to him.

220
00:09:16,251 --> 00:09:18,051
Invade his heart.

221
00:09:18,202 --> 00:09:21,549
Our village shaman tried to rid them.

222
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:24,073
He could not.

223
00:09:24,893 --> 00:09:28,130
Then a vision came to him.

224
00:09:28,229 --> 00:09:31,646
A stronger healer would come.

225
00:09:32,644 --> 00:09:34,514
You.

226
00:09:36,037 --> 00:09:38,971
You will save Gabriel.

227
00:09:41,175 --> 00:09:43,992
I don't know about evil spirits.

228
00:09:44,412 --> 00:09:46,879
All I know is that your son was born

229
00:09:46,881 --> 00:09:48,448
with a heart that I can't fix.

230
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:49,615
I'm sorry.

231
00:09:49,617 --> 00:09:53,407
I would not have come so far
if I did not believe.

232
00:09:57,524 --> 00:10:00,562
We'll give him medicine
to make him feel better.

233
00:10:00,895 --> 00:10:02,969
And then you can take him home.

234
00:10:25,018 --> 00:10:26,552
We tell her we're sorry,

235
00:10:26,554 --> 00:10:28,354
we have no news yet, and then...

236
00:10:28,356 --> 00:10:30,275
Nope. You can't say that.
It's an expensive word.

237
00:10:30,302 --> 00:10:32,435
- "Sorry"?
- You can act sorry.

238
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,659
You can feel sorry.

239
00:10:33,661 --> 00:10:34,994
In fact, you should feel sorry.

240
00:10:34,996 --> 00:10:36,229
You just can't say it.

241
00:10:36,231 --> 00:10:38,131
Okay, uh, "I feel bad for you

242
00:10:38,133 --> 00:10:40,099
- because we made a mistake and..."
- Nope.

243
00:10:40,101 --> 00:10:41,940
A mistake isn't a mistake?

244
00:10:41,965 --> 00:10:44,070
Well, it's "an unanticipated outcome

245
00:10:44,072 --> 00:10:45,571
of an expected action."

246
00:10:45,573 --> 00:10:48,040
You can't use language that
implies blameworthy conduct.

247
00:10:48,042 --> 00:10:51,144
But if we did lose the specimen,
isn't it actually a mistake,

248
00:10:51,146 --> 00:10:53,278
and aren't we sorry,
and aren't we blameworthy?

249
00:10:53,302 --> 00:10:54,346
Yes.

250
00:10:54,371 --> 00:10:58,317
Doesn't mean we can make it
any easier for her attorney.

251
00:10:58,319 --> 00:10:59,986
Hello, Elizabeth.

252
00:10:59,988 --> 00:11:02,455
I'm Jessica Preston
from Risk Management.

253
00:11:02,457 --> 00:11:04,757
- How are you?
- I don't like the sound of that.

254
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:07,059
I know. I really need
a new... a new job title.

255
00:11:07,061 --> 00:11:09,896
Seems that we've encountered
an unexpected occurrence.

256
00:11:09,936 --> 00:11:11,207
The laboratory has been unable

257
00:11:11,232 --> 00:11:12,698
to locate your tissue specimen.

258
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,201
We don't want you to be
unnecessarily alarmed,

259
00:11:15,226 --> 00:11:17,547
but we want you to be fully
aware of what's going on.

260
00:11:17,572 --> 00:11:20,740
But ho... How will I know
if I have cancer

261
00:11:20,742 --> 00:11:21,874
if you don't find it?

262
00:11:21,876 --> 00:11:23,643
We are looking everywhere.

263
00:11:23,645 --> 00:11:24,810
We will find it.

264
00:11:24,812 --> 00:11:26,879
As long as it's in formalin
or a refrigerator,

265
00:11:26,881 --> 00:11:27,914
everything will be fine.

266
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:28,915
For how long?

267
00:11:28,917 --> 00:11:31,617
At least 24 hours. Maybe even 36.

268
00:11:33,554 --> 00:11:34,754
Well, then you better find it.

269
00:11:36,925 --> 00:11:38,257
Because I will be damned

270
00:11:38,259 --> 00:11:39,926
if I'm gonna have my voice box removed

271
00:11:39,928 --> 00:11:41,460
just because somebody screwed up.

272
00:11:45,567 --> 00:11:48,634
I've implemented
a proactive educational plan.

273
00:11:48,636 --> 00:11:50,603
Well, that's terrific, Shaun.

274
00:11:54,841 --> 00:11:57,410
Why are we talking about that here?

275
00:11:57,412 --> 00:11:59,445
I'm not stupid.

276
00:11:59,447 --> 00:12:01,180
I didn't say you were stupid, Shaun.

277
00:12:01,182 --> 00:12:02,415
Nobody said you were stupid.

278
00:12:02,417 --> 00:12:03,916
But sometimes you lack common sense.

279
00:12:03,918 --> 00:12:07,876
- I'm so sorry to have bothered you.
- This patient is deaf.

280
00:12:08,523 --> 00:12:10,056
Oh.

281
00:12:14,761 --> 00:12:18,231
I started flirting lessons yesterday.

282
00:12:18,233 --> 00:12:19,699
Flirting lessons.

283
00:12:19,701 --> 00:12:21,667
Wish they'd had that when I was young.

284
00:12:21,669 --> 00:12:25,137
Yes, I learned about
the flirting trifecta.

285
00:12:25,139 --> 00:12:26,672
There's the pretentious giggle.

286
00:12:26,674 --> 00:12:28,541
Shaun, what are you getting at?

287
00:12:29,316 --> 00:12:30,598
Flirting,

288
00:12:31,112 --> 00:12:34,647
it requires primarily
nonverbal interactions.

289
00:12:34,649 --> 00:12:37,005
Being perceptive in one social dimension

290
00:12:37,028 --> 00:12:39,128
translates well to other social skills.

291
00:12:39,153 --> 00:12:41,454
You're studying flirting.

292
00:12:41,456 --> 00:12:43,756
Are you lonely, Shaun?

293
00:12:43,758 --> 00:12:45,258
'Cause you know there are...

294
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,526
There are websites now where you can...

295
00:12:47,528 --> 00:12:49,595
I like being alone.

296
00:12:49,597 --> 00:12:51,998
Yeah, well, being alone and being lonely

297
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,299
are two different things.

298
00:12:53,301 --> 00:12:56,102
Sometimes we're lonely,
and we don't even know it.

299
00:12:56,629 --> 00:12:59,543
How would I know it?

300
00:12:59,874 --> 00:13:02,975
Well, uh, loneliness,

301
00:13:02,977 --> 00:13:05,528
it's kind of a dull...

302
00:13:06,581 --> 00:13:07,680
It's like a dark...

303
00:13:07,682 --> 00:13:09,382
Are <i>you</i> lonely?

304
00:13:12,352 --> 00:13:15,261
Yeah, sometimes.

305
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,957
You know, sometimes very much.

306
00:13:21,305 --> 00:13:23,273
You should learn the trifecta.

307
00:13:30,438 --> 00:13:32,104
Hey. Um, hey.

308
00:13:32,106 --> 00:13:33,439
We're looking for a lost specimen

309
00:13:33,441 --> 00:13:35,241
that I am positive left the O.R.

310
00:13:35,243 --> 00:13:36,809
And I'm positive it didn't
make it to the lab.

311
00:13:36,811 --> 00:13:38,511
And since you're the link
between the two,

312
00:13:38,513 --> 00:13:41,180
we wanted to ask you
about your 3:00 run yesterday.

313
00:13:41,182 --> 00:13:42,515
So, you took everything

314
00:13:42,517 --> 00:13:44,317
that was in the refrigerator
in the O.R.?

315
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:46,052
In the refrigerator,
out of the refrigerator.

316
00:13:46,054 --> 00:13:47,353
Everything that's meant to go, I took.

317
00:13:47,355 --> 00:13:49,155
- Did you stop on the way?
- No.

318
00:13:49,157 --> 00:13:50,723
Straight from the surgery to the lab,

319
00:13:50,725 --> 00:13:51,824
just like the rules say.

320
00:13:51,826 --> 00:13:53,592
Well, did you stop at the restroom

321
00:13:53,594 --> 00:13:55,528
or the... the coffee machine,
the cafeteria?

322
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:57,396
You know, believe it or not,
I can go a whole 30 minutes

323
00:13:57,398 --> 00:13:59,265
without stopping for a cream puff.

324
00:13:59,267 --> 00:14:00,299
We're just desperate.

325
00:14:00,301 --> 00:14:01,634
All we care about is the specimen

326
00:14:01,636 --> 00:14:03,169
and avoiding a full-on investigation.

327
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:05,281
Investigation?

328
00:14:05,786 --> 00:14:08,207
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

329
00:14:08,209 --> 00:14:09,342
I-I-I-If we don't find it,

330
00:14:09,344 --> 00:14:11,243
then the legal department gets involved.

331
00:14:11,245 --> 00:14:12,912
Everyone who was in contact with it,

332
00:14:12,914 --> 00:14:14,680
who might have been in contact with it

333
00:14:14,682 --> 00:14:16,169
goes under a magnifying glass.

334
00:14:16,194 --> 00:14:17,316
I'm not looking forward to it.

335
00:14:17,318 --> 00:14:19,485
You looking forward to it?
She's not looking forward to it.

336
00:14:19,487 --> 00:14:21,687
They're gonna check your
social media, your computer.

337
00:14:21,689 --> 00:14:24,090
- Blood tests.
- Blood tests.

338
00:14:24,092 --> 00:14:26,425
But if you find it before then...?

339
00:14:26,427 --> 00:14:27,560
Then life goes on.

340
00:14:27,562 --> 00:14:28,961
The same as it always has.

341
00:14:30,296 --> 00:14:31,831
I did stop.

342
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:32,965
At the cafeteria.

343
00:14:32,967 --> 00:14:35,267
The cashier is smokin'.

344
00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:37,870
I might have been distracted
for a little while.

345
00:14:38,573 --> 00:14:41,261
Okay. Thanks.

346
00:15:24,318 --> 00:15:26,899
Water.

347
00:15:27,422 --> 00:15:29,455
Always more water.

348
00:15:31,426 --> 00:15:32,858
Even more.

349
00:15:38,243 --> 00:15:39,909
I know. It's scary.

350
00:15:44,439 --> 00:15:47,173
You are good with children.

351
00:15:47,175 --> 00:15:48,641
You are father?

352
00:15:48,643 --> 00:15:49,975
No.

353
00:15:49,977 --> 00:15:51,857
One day, I hope.

354
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:00,953
Page rapid response team, STAT.

355
00:16:15,145 --> 00:16:16,477
Has he developed endocarditis?

356
00:16:16,502 --> 00:16:18,582
His echo didn't reveal vegetations

357
00:16:18,612 --> 00:16:20,237
on his valves or...

358
00:16:20,373 --> 00:16:22,573
endocardium.

359
00:16:22,575 --> 00:16:24,475
He has not developed a fever.

360
00:16:24,477 --> 00:16:26,145
Let's be sure. Get blood cultures.

361
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:28,810
- Order them times two, 15 minutes.
- It's in the wrong place.

362
00:16:35,131 --> 00:16:37,169
It was in the wrong place.

363
00:16:37,373 --> 00:16:39,325
Okay.

364
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,415
Times two. 15 minutes apart.

365
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,193
Hey.

366
00:16:52,195 --> 00:16:55,162
Um, Leonard says that
he stops by here to see you.

367
00:16:55,164 --> 00:16:56,797
Yeah.

368
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:58,966
He pretends the cafeteria
is on his route.

369
00:16:58,968 --> 00:17:00,468
Like I don't know where the lab is.

370
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:02,169
Yesterday around 3:00, Gwen.

371
00:17:02,171 --> 00:17:04,538
Notice anything on the food
trays that wasn't food?

372
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,464
Around 3:00?

373
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:07,952
Just the usual...

374
00:17:07,977 --> 00:17:12,704
uh, Tupperware, sunglasses,
cellphones, a condom.

375
00:17:12,806 --> 00:17:14,348
Around 4:00, I found a glass eye.

376
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:16,083
You see a biohazard bag?

377
00:17:16,085 --> 00:17:19,220
Uh, the ziplock bag
with the red circles?

378
00:17:19,222 --> 00:17:20,659
Yeah.

379
00:17:21,475 --> 00:17:23,141
C'mon.

380
00:17:26,606 --> 00:17:29,340
You can move the mitral valve.

381
00:17:29,365 --> 00:17:31,132
Thanks for the visual aid.

382
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:33,134
You can't move the mitral valve.

383
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:35,425
Now, if Mr. Potato Head
had an atrial septal nose

384
00:17:35,457 --> 00:17:36,923
- and hypertrophic obstructive...
- I believe...

385
00:17:36,948 --> 00:17:38,881
I believe the abnormal insertion

386
00:17:38,908 --> 00:17:40,941
- of the mitral valve can be...
- Stop.

387
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,826
Follow me.

388
00:17:46,851 --> 00:17:50,686
Pretty sure I saw a biohazard
bag in here yesterday.

389
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,329
You're lucky you came when you did.

390
00:17:52,354 --> 00:17:54,921
It's due to get dumped in two hours.

391
00:17:55,306 --> 00:17:58,025
Ugh, dentures. They're the worst.

392
00:17:58,027 --> 00:17:59,560
You know, every patient
gets a denture cup

393
00:17:59,585 --> 00:18:00,665
with their name on it.

394
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:03,197
So, tell me, why are
the dentures never in the cup?

395
00:18:03,199 --> 00:18:05,099
And if they are, it's the wrong cup?

396
00:18:05,101 --> 00:18:07,435
One of life's mysteries.

397
00:18:07,437 --> 00:18:10,771
Biohazard bag sighting.

398
00:18:10,773 --> 00:18:12,807
A biohazard bag for a coin purse?

399
00:18:12,809 --> 00:18:13,808
Really?

400
00:18:15,978 --> 00:18:18,412
Finally, a septal myectomy

401
00:18:18,414 --> 00:18:19,880
will open the outflow tract,

402
00:18:19,882 --> 00:18:21,716
and the mitral valve can be re-implanted

403
00:18:21,718 --> 00:18:23,617
into a more normal position.

404
00:18:23,619 --> 00:18:25,619
Thank you. That's my idea.

405
00:18:25,621 --> 00:18:27,755
Can you do this procedure on Gabriel?

406
00:18:27,757 --> 00:18:29,670
No.

407
00:18:29,824 --> 00:18:31,824
It's a terrible idea, and it won't work.

408
00:18:31,873 --> 00:18:33,861
So, what was the point
of this dog and pony show?

409
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:36,697
'Cause you seemed keen on
making medical decisions for me.

410
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:38,099
So just insubordination?

411
00:18:38,101 --> 00:18:40,968
And we were probably gonna
wind up coming to you anyway.

412
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:43,270
Once Dr. Murphy gets an idea,
he stays with it,

413
00:18:43,272 --> 00:18:44,839
regardless of what anyone says.

414
00:18:44,841 --> 00:18:46,698
This can work.

415
00:18:46,762 --> 00:18:48,706
Yes, this can work.

416
00:18:48,874 --> 00:18:51,975
And it would be a great idea if
the boy had two hours to live.

417
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:55,516
Is fear of failure
a good reason not to do this?

418
00:18:57,686 --> 00:18:59,527
No.

419
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,612
But you know what is?

420
00:19:01,669 --> 00:19:04,870
The thought that he might have
a few more birthdays...

421
00:19:04,927 --> 00:19:06,927
or make a best friend.

422
00:19:06,929 --> 00:19:08,896
And... I don't know.

423
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:11,232
I'm not sending him home in a box.

424
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,232
We got to go.

425
00:19:15,257 --> 00:19:16,937
Gabriel's arrhythmia, it's gotten worse.

426
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,740
You still haven't found it?

427
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:21,976
I can get Ms. Preston
to address any questions...

428
00:19:21,978 --> 00:19:23,911
She wasn't in the surgery. <i>You</i> were.

429
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:27,034
She is the point person for
all therapeutic misadventures.

430
00:19:27,037 --> 00:19:29,037
Are you kidding me?

431
00:19:29,062 --> 00:19:32,897
I may lose my voice
for absolutely no reason,

432
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:34,522
and you are using canned jargon.

433
00:19:34,524 --> 00:19:37,124
That sample cup doesn't have toothpaste

434
00:19:37,431 --> 00:19:40,206
or socks or sunblock in it, okay?
It has my life!

435
00:19:45,168 --> 00:19:47,201
I'm sorry.

436
00:19:49,114 --> 00:19:50,681
Thank you.

437
00:19:56,954 --> 00:19:59,556
- Good for you.
- Yeah, right.

438
00:19:59,582 --> 00:20:01,982
- just broke about eight rules.
- Maybe.

439
00:20:01,984 --> 00:20:03,851
"Ms. Preston" won't hear
about it from me.

440
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:07,788
You should go find that sample, though.

441
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:10,858
Thanks.

442
00:20:13,858 --> 00:20:17,187
The meds aren't working.
The question is why.

443
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,669
M-Maybe the arrhythmia
is just another manifestation

444
00:20:21,671 --> 00:20:23,161
of Gabriel's L.V. dysfunction.

445
00:20:23,205 --> 00:20:25,493
We should still be seeing
at least a modest decline

446
00:20:25,518 --> 00:20:27,885
- in his ectopy.
- Maybe his gradient is worse.

447
00:20:27,887 --> 00:20:29,507
We could try calcium channel blockers.

448
00:20:29,585 --> 00:20:32,319
There's a much simpler explanation.

449
00:20:39,455 --> 00:20:41,956
Good news about his endocarditis...

450
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:43,023
heart inflammation.

451
00:20:43,025 --> 00:20:44,925
His tests are normal.

452
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:47,194
But we still are concerned.

453
00:20:47,196 --> 00:20:50,395
For some reason,
his medication isn't helping.

454
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,654
Our best explanation is...

455
00:20:52,735 --> 00:20:55,169
he hasn't been taking his medication.

456
00:21:09,551 --> 00:21:11,652
I am trying to save his life.

457
00:21:11,654 --> 00:21:12,835
But withholding his medicine?

458
00:21:12,907 --> 00:21:15,408
By keeping him here.

459
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:17,324
If he takes the medicine
and becomes better,

460
00:21:17,326 --> 00:21:18,959
you send him to die.

461
00:21:18,961 --> 00:21:21,595
But there is nothing else
that we can do for him here.

462
00:21:21,597 --> 00:21:25,593
You do not understand
where I live, what it is like.

463
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:28,726
I don't know your village.

464
00:21:29,405 --> 00:21:31,605
But I do know what it's like to be poor.

465
00:21:33,308 --> 00:21:35,177
I grew up with nothing.

466
00:21:35,278 --> 00:21:36,477
My sister was disabled.

467
00:21:36,479 --> 00:21:38,911
My parents couldn't afford
her meds or treatments.

468
00:21:39,025 --> 00:21:43,224
And it killed them, and me,
to watch her suffer.

469
00:21:44,077 --> 00:21:48,354
But when nothing can be done,
nothing can be done.

470
00:21:49,285 --> 00:21:51,425
You became a doctor?

471
00:21:52,717 --> 00:21:55,518
You did not accept being poor.

472
00:21:56,395 --> 00:21:58,099
No.

473
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:01,936
Then you do not understand at all.

474
00:22:04,873 --> 00:22:07,638
We want for everything... food.

475
00:22:07,877 --> 00:22:11,334
Peace. Medicine.

476
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:16,583
But our greatest want is hope.

477
00:22:19,288 --> 00:22:22,056
If we leave here, we leave hope behind.

478
00:22:30,433 --> 00:22:31,699
Okay.

479
00:22:31,897 --> 00:22:34,183
I'll do what I can.

480
00:22:37,302 --> 00:22:38,714
I dropped by to see Elizabeth.

481
00:22:38,763 --> 00:22:40,721
Not surprisingly, she's very upset.

482
00:22:40,842 --> 00:22:42,787
There wasn't much I could offer
in the way of comfort.

483
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:44,161
If only people did their jobs.

484
00:22:44,249 --> 00:22:45,582
Which people?

485
00:22:45,634 --> 00:22:49,702
Scrub nurses, couriers, lab techs...

486
00:22:49,704 --> 00:22:51,571
That's a curiously limited list.

487
00:22:51,573 --> 00:22:52,906
I did the surgery correctly.

488
00:22:52,908 --> 00:22:54,374
I don't think it's too much
to expect others

489
00:22:54,376 --> 00:22:56,142
to do their jobs correctly, as well.

490
00:22:56,144 --> 00:22:57,914
So, not your fault, not your problem.

491
00:22:57,994 --> 00:22:59,694
What are you trying to do,
make me feel guilty?

492
00:22:59,815 --> 00:23:01,948
Yes. I want you to feel horrible.

493
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,683
That's the only thing
that's gonna make you change.

494
00:23:03,685 --> 00:23:05,652
- Into what?
- The guy I married.

495
00:23:05,654 --> 00:23:08,421
The guy who cared more
about patients than politics.

496
00:23:08,423 --> 00:23:10,256
Ah, okay, I get it.

497
00:23:10,258 --> 00:23:13,126
This is about me vying
for president of the hospital.

498
00:23:13,128 --> 00:23:14,661
Which we discussed at length,

499
00:23:14,663 --> 00:23:17,441
which you said you were
100% behind me on.

500
00:23:17,476 --> 00:23:19,042
I didn't realize how far behind.

501
00:23:19,067 --> 00:23:20,834
You think I've left you behind?

502
00:23:20,836 --> 00:23:22,368
Hmm.

503
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:25,244
Uh, Tuesday...

504
00:23:25,307 --> 00:23:27,040
"Capital expenditures meeting delayed.

505
00:23:27,042 --> 00:23:28,041
Will be late."

506
00:23:28,043 --> 00:23:31,277
Wednesday... "Fundraising event
ran over. Don't wait up."

507
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:33,179
- Thursday...
- Iz, there are things about my job...

508
00:23:33,181 --> 00:23:34,184
Right.

509
00:23:34,449 --> 00:23:36,067
"Not your fault."

510
00:23:48,597 --> 00:23:49,629
Hello.

511
00:23:50,033 --> 00:23:51,673
Hey.

512
00:23:51,844 --> 00:23:55,078
Did you know that specimens
in formalin go to one place,

513
00:23:55,103 --> 00:23:57,137
exempt specimens somewhere else,

514
00:23:57,139 --> 00:23:58,605
aerobic and anaerobic cultures...

515
00:23:58,607 --> 00:23:59,839
two different places?

516
00:23:59,841 --> 00:24:02,175
Um, radioactive, medical device,

517
00:24:02,177 --> 00:24:04,110
forensic specimens... all different?

518
00:24:04,112 --> 00:24:05,545
And all handled by different staff?

519
00:24:05,547 --> 00:24:06,513
Did you know that?

520
00:24:07,311 --> 00:24:08,811
Yes.

521
00:24:08,961 --> 00:24:10,060
Oh.

522
00:24:10,085 --> 00:24:12,118
I made a chart, too.

523
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,721
A qualitative observation log
of what you taught me.

524
00:24:14,723 --> 00:24:15,922
What did I teach you?

525
00:24:15,924 --> 00:24:17,483
Flirting.

526
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:19,926
Every time I saw
someone flirt, I noted it

527
00:24:19,928 --> 00:24:21,494
and cross-referenced the subject,

528
00:24:21,496 --> 00:24:24,097
object, and nonverbal gestures.

529
00:24:24,099 --> 00:24:25,532
I knew it.

530
00:24:25,534 --> 00:24:27,200
Gwen, the cashier.

531
00:24:27,202 --> 00:24:30,170
She made out that it was
all the courier, but...

532
00:24:30,172 --> 00:24:31,371
That's my name.

533
00:24:31,373 --> 00:24:33,006
Yes. You made flirting gestures.

534
00:24:33,008 --> 00:24:34,384
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

535
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:36,843
You brushed your hair back.

536
00:24:37,324 --> 00:24:40,604
Right hand, side sweeping.

537
00:24:41,612 --> 00:24:43,660
At Dr. Melendez?

538
00:24:43,685 --> 00:24:46,424
No, I don't think so. Shaun.

539
00:24:46,621 --> 00:24:48,221
- No.
- Yes.

540
00:24:48,223 --> 00:24:49,856
You were at the nurses station,

541
00:24:49,858 --> 00:24:51,858
and he said, "Good for you,"

542
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:54,235
and you said, "Yeah, right.
I just broke about eight rules,"

543
00:24:54,329 --> 00:24:56,596
and smiled and giggled
and brushed your hair back.

544
00:24:59,234 --> 00:25:01,034
"Ms. Preston" won't hear
about it from me.

545
00:25:06,241 --> 00:25:08,241
It's possible you have ringworm.

546
00:25:09,977 --> 00:25:12,645
Shaun, sometimes people toss their hair

547
00:25:12,647 --> 00:25:14,147
just 'cause it's in their face.

548
00:25:14,149 --> 00:25:15,848
Murphy.

549
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:17,417
I'd like you to elaborate on your idea.

550
00:25:17,419 --> 00:25:19,252
Mm, my terrible idea?

551
00:25:19,254 --> 00:25:20,520
That's the one.

552
00:25:33,902 --> 00:25:36,569
You can move the anterior
leaflet of the valve

553
00:25:36,571 --> 00:25:37,670
and reattach it.

554
00:25:37,811 --> 00:25:40,280
No, we can't.

555
00:25:40,542 --> 00:25:43,343
This is an exact replica
of the kid's heart,

556
00:25:43,345 --> 00:25:46,090
and there's no anchor point
to reattach it.

557
00:25:46,348 --> 00:25:48,014
So that part of your idea
is still terrible.

558
00:25:48,016 --> 00:25:50,028
Okay.

559
00:25:50,622 --> 00:25:52,088
But the rest of it?

560
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:53,997
We're dealing with a huge septum...

561
00:25:54,022 --> 00:25:55,355
25 millimeters.

562
00:25:55,357 --> 00:25:56,823
What would that number be
in a healthy kid?

563
00:25:56,825 --> 00:25:58,224
About 8.

564
00:25:58,226 --> 00:25:59,826
If we go anywhere near that number,

565
00:25:59,828 --> 00:26:02,762
we won't have enough support
for the valve.

566
00:26:04,765 --> 00:26:08,901
But let's say we took that down to 20...

567
00:26:08,903 --> 00:26:10,403
That won't be enough

568
00:26:10,405 --> 00:26:12,772
to relieve the outflow obstruction.

569
00:26:15,709 --> 00:26:17,235
Okay.

570
00:26:17,646 --> 00:26:19,279
18.

571
00:26:20,648 --> 00:26:22,148
Okay.

572
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:16,998
Let's take him off bypass.

573
00:27:29,384 --> 00:27:30,583
He's dead.

574
00:27:30,585 --> 00:27:32,643
Again. 16.

575
00:27:33,096 --> 00:27:34,768
I'm really tired.

576
00:27:36,282 --> 00:27:39,659
I used to think that I wanted to be

577
00:27:39,661 --> 00:27:41,527
the best surgeon in history.

578
00:27:41,529 --> 00:27:43,383
But my new goal?

579
00:27:43,408 --> 00:27:47,177
Is just not to get washed out
of my residency.

580
00:27:49,482 --> 00:27:52,052
You have a surgery now?

581
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,539
No.

582
00:27:53,541 --> 00:27:55,104
I'm here to see how I can help.

583
00:27:55,128 --> 00:27:57,662
The Chief of Surgery
joining the search party?

584
00:27:57,687 --> 00:27:59,086
Should I take a selfie,

585
00:27:59,088 --> 00:28:00,655
show my friends that
this really happened?

586
00:28:00,657 --> 00:28:02,273
This is a team problem.

587
00:28:02,306 --> 00:28:06,231
- It should be a team solution.
- How do you get a boss like this?

588
00:28:06,296 --> 00:28:08,229
What do we know so far?

589
00:28:13,803 --> 00:28:15,369
Let's take him off bypass.

590
00:28:26,482 --> 00:28:29,650
His outflow is perfect
at 13 millimeters.

591
00:28:30,235 --> 00:28:32,118
Which is irrelevant...

592
00:28:32,249 --> 00:28:34,549
...the mitral valve doesn't have
enough support to close.

593
00:28:35,259 --> 00:28:36,962
He's dead.

594
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:40,161
Again.

595
00:28:41,631 --> 00:28:43,006
Dr. Browne.

596
00:28:43,131 --> 00:28:45,066
Any reason you assumed responsibility

597
00:28:45,091 --> 00:28:46,983
on behalf of the hospital...

598
00:28:47,103 --> 00:28:49,884
told Elizabeth you were "sorry"?

599
00:28:50,707 --> 00:28:52,807
Because I was.

600
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:59,099
Well, I hope we don't see
the price tag on that.

601
00:29:01,171 --> 00:29:03,527
And I think you're out of time.

602
00:29:11,699 --> 00:29:13,799
Let's take him off bypass.

603
00:29:25,308 --> 00:29:26,941
Yes.

604
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:30,911
14 millimeters.

605
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:33,015
Exactly.

606
00:29:33,216 --> 00:29:34,570
Yeah.

607
00:29:34,688 --> 00:29:36,711
Exactly.

608
00:29:37,186 --> 00:29:41,968
Our margin of error is exceedingly low.

609
00:29:42,091 --> 00:29:44,398
Good luck.

610
00:29:44,527 --> 00:29:46,406
You believe in luck?

611
00:29:46,496 --> 00:29:50,398
It's something people say
in difficult situations.

612
00:29:52,981 --> 00:29:54,247
Neither do I.

613
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,493
Again.

614
00:29:57,285 --> 00:30:00,553
The reality is, even
if we found your specimen now,

615
00:30:00,984 --> 00:30:03,670
it's unlikely that it'd still be viable.

616
00:30:07,316 --> 00:30:10,084
You don't know if I have cancer,

617
00:30:11,012 --> 00:30:12,778
and there's no way to find out.

618
00:30:14,599 --> 00:30:19,745
So my choices
are surgery I may not need...

619
00:30:21,548 --> 00:30:24,084
...that will leave me without speech,

620
00:30:25,335 --> 00:30:27,319
or I do nothing and maybe die.

621
00:30:28,264 --> 00:30:30,850
Unfortunately, yes.

622
00:31:52,789 --> 00:31:54,669
Knife.

623
00:32:10,113 --> 00:32:11,780
3 hours, 30 minutes.

624
00:32:12,011 --> 00:32:14,578
You didn't want him on bypass
any longer than five hours.

625
00:32:18,843 --> 00:32:22,287
"Wynken and Blynken are two little eyes,

626
00:32:22,413 --> 00:32:25,296
and Nod is a little head,

627
00:32:25,883 --> 00:32:28,398
and the wooden shoe
that sailed the skies

628
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:30,663
is a wee one's trundle-bed.

629
00:32:31,156 --> 00:32:36,710
So shut your eyes while Mother sings...

630
00:32:39,864 --> 00:32:41,630
How's it look, Dr. Murphy?

631
00:32:44,902 --> 00:32:47,403
14 millimeters.

632
00:32:47,405 --> 00:32:49,138
Exactly.

633
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,172
Perfect.

634
00:32:53,311 --> 00:32:55,589
His septal tissue...

635
00:33:00,051 --> 00:33:02,837
It's stiffer than I anticipated.

636
00:33:10,895 --> 00:33:13,618
I don't think this is gonna be
enough for adequate outflow.

637
00:33:17,835 --> 00:33:20,766
I'm taking the septum down to 13.

638
00:33:21,072 --> 00:33:25,007
Okay, the valve wasn't supported at 13.

639
00:33:25,009 --> 00:33:26,275
The patient died.

640
00:33:26,277 --> 00:33:28,010
That was a model, not a patient.

641
00:33:28,012 --> 00:33:31,172
We're at five hours and three minutes.

642
00:33:36,821 --> 00:33:38,754
We're taking him down to 13.

643
00:33:45,229 --> 00:33:47,226
Field.

644
00:33:47,999 --> 00:33:51,100
All quiet for the time-out.

645
00:33:51,102 --> 00:33:52,801
Patient is Elizabeth McLaren.

646
00:33:52,803 --> 00:33:53,936
No known allergies.

647
00:33:53,938 --> 00:33:56,038
We'll be doing a total laryngectomy

648
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,773
with a Gluck Sorenson U-shaped incision.

649
00:33:57,775 --> 00:33:58,907
Is everyone in agreement?

650
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:01,577
Antibiotics in?

651
00:34:01,579 --> 00:34:03,646
One gram of cefotaxime has been infused.

652
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,913
We anticipate a specimen.

653
00:34:04,915 --> 00:34:06,849
I've requested labels be printed.

654
00:34:06,851 --> 00:34:08,608
Pen.

655
00:34:08,986 --> 00:34:10,719
Prepare to intubate.

656
00:34:12,555 --> 00:34:13,689
Dentures.

657
00:34:14,658 --> 00:34:16,525
You've gotta hold the surgery.

658
00:34:16,527 --> 00:34:19,228
Uh... just give me a little time.

659
00:34:24,335 --> 00:34:26,535
That's 13.

660
00:34:32,410 --> 00:34:34,671
Dammit.

661
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:36,718
Too thin?

662
00:34:37,401 --> 00:34:41,358
The valve doesn't have adequate support.

663
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:43,519
It won't be able to close.

664
00:34:46,757 --> 00:34:48,412
I was wrong.

665
00:35:02,573 --> 00:35:03,572
Whoa.

666
00:35:03,574 --> 00:35:06,775
There's a reattachment point.

667
00:35:06,777 --> 00:35:08,444
We must not have seen it at 14

668
00:35:08,446 --> 00:35:10,846
'cause it was obscured
by the subvalvular tissue.

669
00:35:10,848 --> 00:35:14,583
We can use that as an anchor
point and move the valve.

670
00:35:14,585 --> 00:35:17,152
Your terrible idea just got
a hell of a lot better.

671
00:35:17,154 --> 00:35:18,220
Stitch.

672
00:35:18,222 --> 00:35:20,956
5 hours, 23 minutes.

673
00:35:35,973 --> 00:35:37,239
Hey.

674
00:35:37,241 --> 00:35:38,307
Dentures.

675
00:35:38,309 --> 00:35:39,608
They always end up in the wrong cup,

676
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:41,577
which is why they're so hard
to get back to the owner.

677
00:35:41,579 --> 00:35:42,778
- Okay.
- Right.

678
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,747
What if the label
on the specimen was wrong?

679
00:35:44,749 --> 00:35:47,015
What... What if the nodule is here,

680
00:35:47,017 --> 00:35:48,584
but the container
has the wrong name on it?

681
00:35:48,586 --> 00:35:50,452
Okay, I'm reconciling
the operative records

682
00:35:50,454 --> 00:35:52,421
to the surgery schedule to the specimen.

683
00:35:52,423 --> 00:35:54,377
I'll read the cases,
check the containers,

684
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:55,801
and feel like a jerk for judging you.

685
00:35:55,826 --> 00:35:58,227
Well, you're only a jerk if I'm right.

686
00:36:00,831 --> 00:36:02,686
Pump time?

687
00:36:02,767 --> 00:36:04,900
6 hours, 48 minutes.

688
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,573
Get Mehta in here.

689
00:36:12,776 --> 00:36:15,043
Let's take him off bypass.

690
00:36:42,954 --> 00:36:45,288
12 seconds. Should I get the paddles?

691
00:36:45,587 --> 00:36:48,154
Not yet. Come on, Gabriel.

692
00:36:49,556 --> 00:36:51,257
How long has he been on bypass?

693
00:36:51,259 --> 00:36:52,992
Nearly two hours too long.
We need to jump-start...

694
00:36:52,994 --> 00:36:54,293
Not yet!

695
00:37:02,869 --> 00:37:03,936
Yeah.

696
00:37:03,938 --> 00:37:06,005
Yes!

697
00:37:11,579 --> 00:37:13,879
Dr. Murphy, close him up.

698
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:38,459
It's beating just fine on its own.

699
00:37:53,154 --> 00:37:54,820
Marcus.

700
00:38:05,933 --> 00:38:10,136
There was a specimen cup in
the O.R. prior to your surgery.

701
00:38:10,138 --> 00:38:12,638
It was supposed to be used
for a bullet removal,

702
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,174
but they left the bullet in the body,

703
00:38:15,176 --> 00:38:18,611
and the cup was used
accidentally for your specimen.

704
00:38:18,724 --> 00:38:21,185
Not only was it in formalin,

705
00:38:21,275 --> 00:38:24,343
but it was refrigerated
and fresh as a daisy.

706
00:38:24,678 --> 00:38:27,925
Elizabeth, you don't have cancer.

707
00:38:34,094 --> 00:38:36,746
Thank you.

708
00:38:37,031 --> 00:38:39,265
Doctor.

709
00:38:56,184 --> 00:38:57,650
Intangibles.

710
00:39:07,499 --> 00:39:08,698
Hello.

711
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:10,090
Hello.

712
00:39:10,164 --> 00:39:12,531
- I had a very good day today.
- Yes, you did.

713
00:39:12,533 --> 00:39:14,867
- That was a hell of an operation.
- Yes.

714
00:39:14,869 --> 00:39:16,639
And I caught Claire flirting.

715
00:39:16,664 --> 00:39:17,730
With you?

716
00:39:17,755 --> 00:39:20,530
- Shaun, I think you might be mis...
- With Dr. Melendez.

717
00:39:20,875 --> 00:39:23,476
- Ah, Dr. Melendez.
- I conducted observations,

718
00:39:23,478 --> 00:39:25,745
successfully interpreted them,
and logged them.

719
00:39:25,747 --> 00:39:27,947
Romance in a spreadsheet.

720
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:29,281
I love it.

721
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:33,267
I was aware of the cues
even when Claire wasn't.

722
00:39:33,494 --> 00:39:35,861
I think she needs a life-skills coach.

723
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:38,324
Extrapolating. I like that, too.

724
00:39:38,326 --> 00:39:39,425
That's great, Shaun.

725
00:39:39,427 --> 00:39:41,627
You're paying attention.
You're learning.

726
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:44,398
And when we find you a life coach,

727
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:45,756
one with a fashion sense,

728
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,533
then you're gonna be learning better,

729
00:39:47,535 --> 00:39:49,502
you're gonna be learning faster.

730
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:54,585
Are you giving up on me?

731
00:39:54,909 --> 00:39:56,983
What?

732
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:59,241
No. I haven't given up on you.

733
00:39:59,266 --> 00:40:02,133
I don't want a stranger helping me.

734
00:40:02,583 --> 00:40:04,984
I know, Shaun.

735
00:40:04,986 --> 00:40:06,561
But...

736
00:40:07,634 --> 00:40:10,216
And I can't...

737
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:12,944
I can't always be there. I-I...

738
00:40:13,083 --> 00:40:16,220
I can't always help you
the way you need to be helped,

739
00:40:16,245 --> 00:40:18,178
the way you deserve to be helped.

740
00:40:18,203 --> 00:40:20,704
I don't want a stranger helping me.

741
00:40:33,314 --> 00:40:34,824
Congratulations.

742
00:40:35,086 --> 00:40:36,852
You too.

743
00:40:36,928 --> 00:40:38,795
On your mad sleuthing skills.

744
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:41,520
Something to fall back on
if this surgery thing gets old.

745
00:40:43,658 --> 00:40:45,512
You did a nice job, Claire.

746
00:40:45,537 --> 00:40:47,946
- Thanks.
- And here is our price tag.

747
00:40:47,971 --> 00:40:49,338
We've been served.

748
00:40:49,758 --> 00:40:51,931
But we found it. Elizabeth's fine.

749
00:40:51,933 --> 00:40:52,998
I know.

750
00:40:53,023 --> 00:40:54,802
But we put her through two days of hell,

751
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:56,827
and she wants to make sure it
doesn't happen to anybody else.

752
00:40:56,852 --> 00:40:58,051
I mean, good for her.

753
00:41:01,565 --> 00:41:03,370
What is this?

754
00:41:03,617 --> 00:41:05,550
Gabriel's pacemaker.

755
00:41:05,661 --> 00:41:07,962
I heard you were brilliant again today.

756
00:41:09,716 --> 00:41:10,816
I got lucky.

757
00:41:16,244 --> 00:41:18,958
Do you think Armen would kill
me if I got a pet hedgehog?

758
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,492
I mean, I read that
they're actually pretty...

759
00:41:20,494 --> 00:41:22,494
- Lea.
- Yes, Shaun?

760
00:41:23,496 --> 00:41:25,952
You look absurd in that sweater.

761
00:41:32,462 --> 00:41:34,599
I have apples.

762
00:41:34,856 --> 00:41:37,062
Do you want an apple?

763
00:41:39,613 --> 00:41:41,521
Yeah.
