Our cardiothoracic surgeon,
Dr. Neil Melendez,

in consultation with our head
cardiologist, Dr. Avi Mehta,

22

life-saving surgeries.

25

- Yeah?

157
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,033
What was she doing
when she said that?

158
00:06:00,035 --> 00:06:03,036
Touching me.
She was flirting with you.

159
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:06,406
Sometimes people say
the opposite of what they mean.

160
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:09,209
Um, they use teasing as a way

161
00:06:09,211 --> 00:06:10,710
of saying something
they don't mean

162
00:06:10,712 --> 00:06:12,712
instead of saying something
that they do.

163
00:06:12,737 --> 00:06:15,606
I haven't seen any data on
the use of antonyms

164
00:06:15,617 --> 00:06:16,916
as a flirting technique.

165
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:19,958
Okay.
Well, um, here's what to look for.

166
00:06:19,998 --> 00:06:21,365
- You ready?
- Yes.

167
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:23,356
Okay.

169

The, uh... the squirm.

170
00:06:27,496 --> 00:06:29,596
And the hair sweep.

171
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:31,698
I call it
the flirting trifecta.

172
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:35,301
Hair scuffing is used in both
animals and humans, Claire.

173
00:06:35,303 --> 00:06:38,104
Secreting glands are located
in the scalp and fur.

174
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,573
Scuffing sends hormones
out into the environment

175
00:06:40,575 --> 00:06:43,552
to let a potential mate
know they're interested.

176
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:45,111
Or it could be ringworm.

177
00:06:45,982 --> 00:06:47,180
Yeah.

178
00:06:47,182 --> 00:06:49,516
I suppose you have to
factor for that possibility.

179
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,220
Nice touch.

180
00:06:54,222 --> 00:06:55,588
Beauty increases happiness.

181
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:56,756
Happiness improves outlook.

182

Still on Mission Carpe Diem.

184
00:06:59,661 --> 00:07:00,627

No, we're enjoying dinner

Yeah.
Okay.

193
00:07:18,547 --> 00:07:19,846
The lab.

194
00:07:19,848 --> 00:07:22,048
They misplaced
Elizabeth's specimen.

195
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,750
- Oh, my God.
- Don't worry. They'll find it.

196
00:07:23,752 --> 00:07:26,052
Satisfied?

197
00:07:26,054 --> 00:07:28,121
- It's somewhere.
- Somewhere else.

198
00:07:28,123 --> 00:07:31,224
I love how everyone in surgery
is so fast to blame the lab.

199
00:07:31,226 --> 00:07:32,759
Well, double-checking can't hurt.

200
00:07:32,761 --> 00:07:33,827
Actually it can.

201
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:34,882
Because you are here

202
00:07:34,907 --> 00:07:36,440

double-checking surgery.

203
00:07:36,465 --> 00:07:38,832
I saw the specimen
go in the container.

204
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:40,200
It means it has to be here.

205
00:07:40,202 --> 00:07:43,036
No, all that means is that
it was put in a container.

206
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:44,237
It doesn't mean that 
that container...

207
00:07:44,239 --> 00:07:45,972
was actually put in
the surgery refrigerator

208
00:07:45,974 --> 00:07:48,208
or that it was actually
picked up by the courier.

209
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:50,176
He's even worse than we thought.

210
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,778
Yeah.

211
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,214
Hypertrophic obstructive 
cardiomyopathy,

212
00:07:54,216 --> 00:07:55,815
atrial septal defect,

213
00:07:55,817 --> 00:07:58,351
abnormal insertion of
the mitral valve leaflet.

214

I've never seen so many
anomalies in one heart.

00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:06,960
I'm sorry I pushed for
additional testing.

That only got
his mother's hopes up.

Any medication that'll help?

Beta blockers.

Maybe metoprolol.

220
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,470
It's not like
they'll get him playing soccer,

but they might help him get
to the field to watch.

For a couple of years, anyway.

Better than dying on

what are you getting at?

310

Flirting,

311
00:12:31,112 --> 00:12:34,647
it requires primarily
nonverbal interactions.

312
00:12:34,649 --> 00:12:37,005
Being perceptive in
one social dimension

translates well to
other social skills.
