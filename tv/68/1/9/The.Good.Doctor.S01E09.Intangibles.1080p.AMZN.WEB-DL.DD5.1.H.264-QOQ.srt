1
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,700
那是谁啊
So, who was that?

2
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,010
管家
A housekeeper.

3
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:17,230
早上七点才从你家出来
Leaving your place at 7:00 in the morning?

4
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:18,610
我在面试她
I was interviewing her.

5
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:20,850
你住单间公寓都要请管家
You're hiring a housekeeper for a studio apartment?

6
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,050
我不会请她
I'm not hiring her.

7
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:23,540
她的着装不合格
Her clothes don't match.

8
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:24,330
好吧
Right.

9
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,710
你太混球了  肖恩·莫菲
You're such an asshat, Shaun Murphy.

10
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:41,210
今天我们梦想成真
Today we realize a dream --

11
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:45,200
我们的国际人道主义项目终于开花结果
seeing our international humanitarian program come to fruition.

12
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,430
我们的心胸外科医生  尼尔·梅伦德斯医生
Our cardiothoracic surgeon, Dr. Neil Melendez,

13
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:53,060
与首席心脏科医生艾威·梅达协商
in consultation with our head cardiologist, Dr. Avi Mehta,

14
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:57,330
评估了坦桑尼亚  马拉维和几内亚的儿童
evaluated children from Tanzania to Malawi to Guinea.

15
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:59,450
他们筛选了百余名候选者
They screened over 100 candidates,

16
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,500
每个孩子都需要进行救命的手术
each of them needing life-saving surgeries.

17
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,830
我们最终选中了一位格外鼓舞人心的小男孩
Ultimately, we decided on a particularly inspiring young boy

18
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:05,770
他叫加布里尔
named Gabriel,

19
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:08,330
来自刚果民主共和国
who hails from the Democratic Republic of Congo,

20
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,830
他有严重的先天性心脏畸形
with severe congenital heart anomalies.

21
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:15,050
我们有三位完全符合要求的候选者
We identified three perfect candidates --

22
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,280
-都是我能真正救治的孩子  -谢谢
- children I can actually help. - Hi. Thank you.

23
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,450
-加布里尔不在其中  -算是吧
- Gabriel wasn't one of them. - Yes and no.

24
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,870
我赞同你的选择
I signed off on your choices.

25
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:21,740
但鉴于我看到的超声心动图
But I wouldn't have necessarily eliminated Gabriel

26
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,040
我是不会剔除加布里尔的
based on the echo I saw.

27
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,620
非外科医生人员竟然
A non-surgeon undermining a surgeon

28
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:26,530
否定真正外科医生的手术决定
on his selection of surgical candidates.

29
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:29,480
同事间就各自的决定提出意见是好事
It's healthy when colleagues challenge each others' decisions.

30
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,610
简直是乱来啊
It doesn't make any sense.

31
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:31,970
我们选好了手术候选者
We gave you good candidates.

32
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:32,780
你又不是医生
You're not a doctor.

33
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,440
你怎么就不按照单子来呢
Why wouldn't you stick with the list?

34
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:36,810
有一些不可控因素
There were several intangibles.

35
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,440
给梅伦德斯医生打招呼
Can you say hi to Dr. Melendez?

36
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:45,440
我想某个不可控因素就是孩子很可爱
One of those intangibles, I'm guessing, is cuteness.

37
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:53,480
第一季  第九集
良     医

38
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,730
战争害他们流离失所
Family displaced during the war.

39
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:01,240
母亲一直照料着丈夫
Mother took care of her husband

40
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,570
直到丈夫死于黄热病
until he died of yellow fever.

41
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:03,770
他在家血流而亡
He bled out at home.

42
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,250
一个月后  加布里尔出生了
A month later, Gabriel was born.

43
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:12,480
当一件事不仅看着高尚  而且有新闻效应时
People tend to give more when the cause is not only noble,

44
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,780
人们才愿捐更多
but photogenic,

45
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,780
可爱的孩子和可怜的母亲或许能打动捐赠者
Adorable kids and sympathetic moms may work on donors,

46
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,790
但对我来说没用
but they won't work on me,

47
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,710
也肯定过不了超声心动图这关
and they certainly won't work on echo results.

48
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:20,980
起码过得了我这关
Kinda working on me.

49
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,150
在你说不行之前  至少做一下病情检查
Before you say no, at least do your own work-up.

50
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:35,290
妈妈  怎么不带我去
Mommy, why can't I come?

51
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:37,890
医院担心小孩会带来细菌
The hospital's worried that children bring in germs.

52
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,540
不会的  妈妈  我保证
I won't, Mommy. I promise.

53
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,490
我知道  宝贝  但这就是规定
I know, boo. It's just -- It's the rules.

54
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,210
宝贝  我得挂了
Okay, baby. I have to go now.

55
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:46,490
听玛吉阿姨的话  晚点打给你  好吗
Do what Aunt Maggie says. I'll call you later, okay?

56
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:47,860
我对你的爱长到月亮
I love you to the moon...

57
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,460
还要再回来
And back.

58
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,040
跟三岁的孩子聊语音放松不太容易吧
I can't imagine voice rest could be very easy with a 3-year-old.

59
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,990
没错  对我的播客听众也不太有用
Yeah. Not very effective for my podcast audience either.

60
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:57,020
对了  我也是你的忠实粉丝
Of which, by the way, I'm a huge fan.

61
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,950
很讽刺吧
Grim irony, though, right?

62
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,240
播主失声
A podcaster who loses her voice.

63
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:04,080
伊丽莎白  这肯定是个良性肿瘤
Elizabeth, I'm sure the nodule will be benign

64
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,890
这只会启发你又创作出一集精彩的节目
and this'll be nothing more than an inspiration for another great episode.

65
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,690
要不是良性呢  伊莎贝尔
If it's not benign, Isabel?

66
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:09,680
别想太多了
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

67
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,620
今天就专心摘除结节
Today we're just focused on removing the nodule

68
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,600
然后做活检
and doing the biopsy.

69
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,900
你已经尽力了
And you've done everything you could do.

70
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,070
而且你一发现声音嘶哑了
And when the hoarseness started,

71
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,870
就来最好的医院求治
you sought early care from the best.

72
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,170
我也派了最好的医生
And I sent you to the best.

73
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,220
你俩是完美搭档
You work perfectly together,

74
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,120
就像左右手一样配合完美
kind of ping and pong-ish.

75
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:23,450
很好
It's nice.

76
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:24,840
很多医生夫妻档
A lot of doctors who are married

77
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,650
更像是彼此的保险
are more like miss and match.

78
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,280
邦格乌拉夫人  这是莫菲医生和卡卢医生
Mrs. Bangura, this is Dr. Murphy and Dr. Kalu.

79
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,370
他们来帮我给加布里尔做些检查
They're gonna help me run some tests on Gabriel.

80
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,480
听说你和加布里尔
I heard that you and Gabriel

81
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,850
之前从没出过远门
have never been away from home before.

82
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:38,720
但愿这能让他感到我们的友好
I was hoping that these would make him feel welcome.

83
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,320
是啊  你真好
Yes. You are kind.

84
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:44,260
我也给自己买了一个
I brought one for myself, too.

85
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,430
我们来检查一下吧
How 'bout we all do some medicine?

86
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,250
他真的需要我们帮忙
He really needs our help.

87
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,470
「他需要我们帮忙」
"He needs our help"?

88
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,700
他的胸口听着像装了个吹风机
He sounds like he's got a blow dryer in his chest.

89
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,640
没错  所以他需要我们帮忙
Exactly. Which is why he needs our help.

90
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,100
这就是心脏科医生的毛病
This is the problem with cardiologists --

91
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,190
你们真的很擅长通知病患哪里有问题
You're really good at telling people when something's broken,

92
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,800
却搞不清楚什么时候无法救治
not so good at knowing when they can't be fixed.

93
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,820
只有等完全确定那孩子救不活了
If that kid is dying, I'm not gonna tell his mother that

94
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,100
我才会通知他母亲
unless I'm damn sure.

95
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:24,950
你听到心音了
You heard that heart.

96
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,080
我也听到了
I heard that heart.

97
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,520
心音很糟糕
And it sounded like crap.

98
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,560
在做经食管超声心动检查之前
But until we do a transesophageal echo,

99
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,000
一切都是未知
I don't know anything.

100
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,230
做经食管超声心动检查
Do a transesophageal echo.

101
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,820
她有社会学博士学位
She has a master's degree in Sociology,

102
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,190
信誉完美  推荐信很优秀
impeccable credentials, excellent references,

103
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:49,480
你却因为「她的着装不合格」而拒绝她
and you turned her away because "Her clothes didn't match"?

104
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,470
关系可大了
It's relevant.

105
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:54,030
要是生活技能指导选不出配套的衣服
If a life-skills coach can't select a complementing wardrobe,

106
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,150
那就是生活无能
they lack life skills.

107
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:57,070
但她不会给你搭配衣服啊
But she's not gonna pick out your clothes for you.

108
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,410
她又不是保姆
She's not a nanny.

109
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,130
她只是来帮你解决
She's there to help you with problem-solving,

110
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,610
经济和社交问题的
financial, social interactions.

111
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:04,910
你这么做是因为我没处理好
You're doing this because I did not react well

112
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:07,050
我在逛商店时遇到的持枪抢劫
to a man with a gun robbing a store I was in.

113
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:10,750
从统计上看  我不太可能再遇到那种事了
Statistically, that is very unlikely to ever happen to me again.

114
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:14,300
你会一次又一次地遇到社交互动
Social interactions will happen again and again and again.

115
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,250
这是统计学都不能否定的
It's statistically irrefutable.

116
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,090
如果你学会如何更好地跟人打交道
And if you learn how to get along with people

117
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:21,050
你的人生会更充实  更快乐
a little bit better, you'll have a fuller life. A happier life.

118
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,310
你要是不喜欢她  再找就是
If you don't like this woman, we'll find somebody else.

119
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:24,770
我很快乐
I am happy.

120
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:25,740
你可以更快乐
You could be happier.

121
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:26,870
我不觉得
I don't think so.

122
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,600
我的邻居莉亚
My neighbor, Lea.

123
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,470
她要是遇到火灾  肯定最先被救出去
If she were ever in a fire, she'd be rescued first.

124
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,520
为什么
Why's that?

125
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:38,050
梅伦德斯医生说有魅力的人有优势
Dr. Melendez says attractive people have advantages.

126
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:40,660
梅伦德斯医生说的吗
Dr. Melendez says that, does he?

127
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,920
有什么好笑的
Why is that funny?

128
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,570
不知道  只是
I don't know. It's just, um,

129
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:46,920
有人觉得梅伦德斯医生很有魅力
some people consider Dr. Melendez attractive.

130
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,760
你跟莉亚情况如何
So, how's it going with Lea?

131
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,990
她不喜欢我
She doesn't like me.

132
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:54,190
何出此言
Why do you say that?

133
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:58,400
-她说我是个混球  -是吗
- She said I was an asshat. - Yeah?

134
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,320
她说这话时有什么动作
What was she doing when she said that?

135
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:03,070
-打了我一下  -她是在撩你呢
- Touching me. - She was flirting with you.

136
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:06,040
有时人们会故意说反话
Sometimes people say the opposite of what they mean.

137
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,250
他们用开玩笑的语气
They use teasing as a way

138
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,770
说出一些违心的话
of saying something they don't mean

139
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,820
而不会说出真想表达的意思
instead of saying something that they do.

140
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,820
我还没遇到把说反话
I haven't seen any data on the use of antonyms

141
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,180
当成调情技巧的情况
as a flirting technique.

142
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,220
好  注意看哈
Okay. Well, um, here's what to look for.

143
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,670
-准备好了  -好了
- You ready? - Yes.

144
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,400
好  矫揉造作的笑
Okay. The pretentious giggle.

145
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,290
扭动身体
The, uh -- the squirm.

146
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,480
还有撩头发
And the hair sweep.

147
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,980
这叫做撩骚三重奏
I call it the flirting trifecta.

148
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:35,510
动物和人都会摩挲毛发  克莱尔
Hair scuffing is used in both animals and humans, Claire.

149
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,320
头皮和毛皮上都有分泌腺
Secreting glands are located in the scalp and fur.

150
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,840
摩挲毛发会把荷尔蒙释放到空气中
Scuffing sends hormones out into the environment

151
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,000
以便告知潜在对象自己有兴趣
to let a potential mate know they're interested.

152
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:45,410
也可能是皮癣
Or it could be ringworm.

153
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,250
好吧
Yeah.

154
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:49,540
看来你非得把那种可能归为原因之一
I suppose you have to factor for that possibility.

155
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,360
有品位
Nice touch.

156
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,640
美貌增加幸福值
Beauty increases happiness.

157
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,880
幸福值提升颜值
Happiness improves outlook.

158
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,380
还要及时行乐
Still on Mission Carpe Diem.

159
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,600
你要不要试试
You might want to try it.

160
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:00,810
不用了
I'm doing fine.

161
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,240
我们在水槽边吃晚餐
We're having dinner at the sink.

162
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,440
不  我们是在水槽边享受晚餐
No, we're enjoying dinner at the sink.

163
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,960
但如果你继续那样说话...
Although if you keep talking like that...

164
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,260
我是安德鲁斯
Andrews.

165
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,370
那就再找找  肯定在那
Well, look again. It has to be there.

166
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,650
好的
Yeah. Okay.

167
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:18,490
谁的电话
Who was that?

168
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,570
化验室
The lab.

169
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:22,140
他们找不到伊丽莎白的样本了
They misplaced Elizabeth's specimen.

170
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:23,990
-天呐  -别担心  他们会找到的
- Oh, my God. - Don't worry. They'll find it.

171
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:26,120
满意了
Satisfied?

172
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,310
-肯定在哪里  -反正不在这儿
- It's somewhere. - Somewhere else.

173
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:31,320
你们手术室的人就喜欢把责任推给化验室
I love how everyone in surgery is so fast to blame the lab.

174
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,080
多检查几遍总不为过
Well, double-checking can't hurt.

175
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:34,170
那可说不准
Actually it can.

176
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:34,960
你该多检查几遍手术室
Because you are here

177
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:36,610
但你却跑来这里
when you should be double-checking surgery.

178
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:39,000
我亲眼看到样本放进样本盒里了
I saw the specimen go in the container.

179
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,380
那就说明样本应该在这里
It means it has to be here.

180
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:43,200
不  那只能说明样本被放进样本盒里了
No, all that means is that it was put in a container.

181
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,130
可是不能说明样本盒
It doesn't mean that that container

182
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,100
被放进手术室的冰柜里了
was actually put in the surgery refrigerator

183
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,440
也不能说明送检员拿到了样本
or that it was actually picked up by the courier.

184
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,390
他的病情比我们想象的还要严重
He's even worse than we thought.

185
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,340
是啊
Yeah.

186
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:54,420
肥厚型梗阻性心肌病
Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy,

187
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,880
房间隔缺损
atrial septal defect,

188
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,590
二尖瓣瓣膜异常插入
abnormal insertion of the mitral valve leaflet.

189
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:00,770
我还从没见过一颗心脏能出这么多毛病
I've never seen so many anomalies in one heart.

190
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:06,630
很抱歉我要求做了些额外的检查
I'm sorry I pushed for additional testing.

191
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,820
那是他妈妈所希望的
That only got his mother's hopes up.

192
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,620
有什么药物可以使用
Any medication that'll help?

193
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,440
β受体阻滞剂
Beta blockers.

194
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,800
或许  美托洛尔
Maybe metoprolol.

195
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,570
这些药物无法帮他重返足球场
It's not like they'll get him playing soccer,

196
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:19,830
但至少可以让他到球场边看看比赛
but they might help him get to the field to watch.

197
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,730
反正他只有几年可活了
For a couple of years, anyway.

198
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,220
总比明天死在手术台上要好
Better than dying on a table tomorrow.

199
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,190
你来告诉青木
You tell Aoki.

200
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:31,040
我去告诉他妈妈
I'll break it to the mom.

201
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,230
利普曼医生请到整形外科手术室
Dr. Lippman to plastic surgery.

202
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:42,630
利普曼医生请到整形外科手术室
Dr. Lippman to plastic surgery.

203
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,880
这叫卡拉  是我们部落的萨满送的
It's called sakara, given by our shaman.

204
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,660
他的心跳
His heartbeat...

205
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:03,930
随这乐声而动
it follows the sound.

206
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:07,720
确保在你们修补好之前  心脏还能跳动
It reminds it to beat until you fix it.

207
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,520
邦格乌拉夫人  检查已经全部做完了
Mrs. Bangura, I've completed all the tests.

208
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,190
很抱歉地告诉你这一趟...
And I'm sorry that you've come all this way --

209
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:15,740
加布里尔在我肚子里的时候
When Gabriel was in my belly,

210
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:16,880
恶灵降临到他身上
evil spirits came to him.

211
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:19,420
侵蚀他的心脏
Invade his heart.

212
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,550
我们部落的萨满试图将恶灵驱逐
Our village shaman tried to rid them.

213
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,730
但他失败了
He could not.

214
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,400
之后他看到了一幕幻象
Then a vision came to him.

215
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:32,740
一个强大的医者将会来临
A stronger healer would come.

216
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:35,320
就是你
You.

217
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,520
你会拯救加布里尔
You will save Gabriel.

218
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,450
我不知道什么恶灵
I don't know about evil spirits.

219
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,410
我只知道你的儿子有先天性心脏病
All I know is that your son was born

220
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:49,980
而且我无法医治
with a heart that I can't fix.

221
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,300
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

222
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,240
如果我不相信  我根本不能撑到现在
I would not have come so far if I did not believe.

223
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,400
我们会给他药物治疗缓解他的痛苦
We'll give him medicine to make him feel better.

224
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:04,160
之后你可以带他回家了
And then you can take him home.

225
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,120
我们说我们很抱歉
We tell her we're sorry,

226
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,930
到现在仍然没有进展  然后
we have no news yet, and then --

227
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:30,850
不行  你不能这么说
Nope. You can't say that.

228
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:31,920
这个词不能轻易说出口
It's an expensive word.

229
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,260
-「抱歉」吗  -你可以表现得很抱歉
- "Sorry"? - You can act sorry.

230
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,250
你可以感到抱歉
You can feel sorry.

231
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,570
事实上  你应该为此感到抱歉
In fact, you should feel sorry.

232
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:37,700
但你就是不能说出来
You just can't say it.

233
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,690
好吧  「我们很遗憾
Okay, uh, "I feel bad for you

234
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:41,570
-因为我们犯了个错误」  -不行
- because we made a mistake and --" - Nope.

235
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:43,130
这难道不是错误吗
A mistake isn't a mistake?

236
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:47,120
这是「由预计的行为所造成的意想不到的结果」
Well, it's "An unanticipated outcome of an expected action."

237
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,590
你不能用语言暗示出这种行为该受到谴责
You can't use language that implies blameworthy conduct.

238
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:52,780
但如果我们真的弄丢了样本  这不是错误吗
But if we did lose the specimen, isn't it actually a mistake,

239
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,430
我们难道不应该为此抱歉  为此受到谴责吗
and aren't we sorry, and aren't we blameworthy?

240
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:55,820
应该
Yes.

241
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:58,390
但这可不能让我们轻松搞定她的律师
Doesn't mean we can make it any easier for her attorney.

242
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:01,580
你好  伊丽莎白
Hello, Elizabeth.

243
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:04,230
我是风险管理部门的杰西卡·普莱斯顿
I'm Jessica Preston from Risk Management.

244
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,090
你怎么样
How are you?

245
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:06,360
这个职位听起来不太妙
I don't like the sound of that.

246
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,740
我知道  我的确需要一个新的  新的头衔
I know. I really need a new -- a new job title.

247
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,590
我们似乎遇到了一些意料之外的情况
Seems that we've encountered an unexpected occurrence.

248
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:14,330
化验室找不到你的组织样本了
The laboratory has been unable to locate your tissue specimen.

249
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:17,040
我们不想引起你不必要的惊慌
We don't want you to be unnecessarily alarmed,

250
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,400
但我们希望你能充分了解事情的进展
but we want you to be fully aware of what's going on.

251
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,410
但是  如果你们找不到样本
But ho-- How will I know if I have cancer

252
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:23,700
我怎么知道我是不是患了癌症
if you don't find it?

253
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,220
我们正在四处寻找
We are looking everywhere.

254
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:26,360
我们会找到的
We will find it.

255
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,540
只要样本还泡在福尔马林里或还在冰柜里
As long as it's in formalin or a refrigerator,

256
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,570
就没事
everything will be fine.

257
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:30,590
可以存放多久
For how long?

258
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:33,050
至少24小时  甚至36小时
At least 24 hours. Maybe even 36.

259
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,580
那你们最好给我找到
Well, then you better find it.

260
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:39,800
如果因为有人搞砸了
Because I will be damned

261
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,440
而导致我的声带被切除
if I'm gonna have my voice box removed

262
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,010
我绝不原谅
just because somebody screwed up.

263
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:50,070
我实施了一项积极的教育计划
I've implemented a proactive educational plan.

264
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,740
那很好  肖恩
Well, that's terrific, Shaun.

265
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:58,310
为什么你在这里提这个
Why are we talking about that here?

266
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,650
我可不傻
I'm not stupid.

267
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,900
我没说你傻  肖恩
I didn't say you were stupid, Shaun.

268
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:03,970
没人说你傻
Nobody said you were stupid.

269
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:05,410
只是有时候你缺乏常识
But sometimes you lack common sense.

270
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:07,030
打扰到你我很抱歉
I'm so sorry to have bothered you.

271
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,780
这位患者听不到
This patient is deaf.

272
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,310
我昨天上了调情课
I started flirting lessons yesterday.

273
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,030
调情课
Flirting lessons.

274
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,130
要是我年轻的时候有这样的课就好了
Wish they'd had that when I was young.

275
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,260
是的  我学了撩骚三重奏
Yes, I learned about the flirting trifecta.

276
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:28,160
包括矫揉造作的笑
There's the pretentious giggle.

277
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,560
肖恩  你在说什么
Shaun, what are you getting at?

278
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:31,920
调情
Flirting,

279
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:36,240
首先需要非语言性的交流
it requires primarily nonverbal interactions.

280
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,540
洞察感知某一社会层面
Being perceptive in one social dimension

281
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,740
然后再将其翻译成其它的社交技巧
translates well to other social skills.

282
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,260
你在学习撩妹
You're studying flirting.

283
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:44,990
你觉得孤单吗  肖恩
Are you lonely, Shaun?

284
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:48,920
你知道现在有很多网站  在那上面你可以...
'Cause you know there are... There are websites now where you can --

285
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,540
我喜欢一个人
I like being alone.

286
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,830
好  但一个人和孤单是两回事
Yeah, well, being alone and being lonely are two different things.

287
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:57,460
有时我们很孤单  但自己却浑然不知
Sometimes we're lonely, and we don't even know it.

288
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:00,700
那我怎么能知道
How would I know it?

289
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:06,030
孤单  是一种阴郁的...
Well, uh, loneliness, it's kind of a dull...

290
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,290
就像是黑暗的...
It's like a dark...

291
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:10,540
你孤单吗
Are you lonely?

292
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,440
有时候
Yeah, sometimes.

293
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:19,300
有时候非常孤单
You know, sometimes very much.

294
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,950
那你应该学学撩骚三重奏
You should learn the trifecta.

295
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,010
我们在找一份丢失的样本
We're looking for a lost specimen

296
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:36,790
我很确定它不在手术室
that I am positive left the O.R.

297
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,370
我也很确定它没有被送到化验室
And I'm positive it didn't make it to the lab.

298
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:40,010
既然你是连接这两个地方的纽带
And since you're the link between the two,

299
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,650
所以我们想问问你昨天下午三点送的那趟
we wanted to ask you about your 3:00 run yesterday.

300
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:43,950
所以  你是不是
So, you took everything

301
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,880
把放在手术室冰箱里的所有东西都拿走了
that was in the refrigerator in the O.R.?

302
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,670
在冰箱里的  不在冰箱里的
In the refrigerator, out of the refrigerator.

303
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:48,910
所有该拿走的我都拿走了
Everything that's meant to go, I took.

304
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,800
-你有在路上停留吗  -没有
- Did you stop on the way? -No.

305
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,480
按照规定  直接从手术室送到化验室了
Straight from the surgery to the lab, just like the rules say.

306
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,050
你有没有去卫生间
Well, did you stop at the restroom

307
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,080
或者  咖啡机  咖啡厅
or the -- the coffee machine, the cafeteria?

308
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:57,820
不管你们信不信
You know, believe it or not,

309
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:58,800
我可以走完三十分钟的路程
I can go a whole 30 minutes

310
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,470
中途不会停下来吃奶油泡芙
without stopping for a cream puff.

311
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:01,780
我们走投无路了
We're just desperate.

312
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,130
我们关心的就只有样本
All we care about is the specimen

313
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:04,960
以及避免上级全面调查
and avoiding a full-on investigation.

314
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:06,860
调查
Investigation?

315
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,720
是的  是的  是的
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

316
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,070
如果我们找不到的话
I-I-I-If we don't find it,

317
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:13,050
法务部门就会介入
then the legal department gets involved.

318
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:14,480
每个接触过的人
Everyone who was in contact with it,

319
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,240
每个可能接触过的人
who might have been in contact with it

320
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,000
都会被调查
goes under a magnifying glass.

321
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,960
我可不想这样
I'm not looking forward to it.

322
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,990
你想这样吗  她反正不想
You looking forward to it? She's not looking forward to it.

323
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:23,120
他们会查看你的社交媒体  你的电脑
They're gonna check your social media, your computer.

324
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,450
-血检  -血检
- Blood tests. - Blood tests.

325
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,980
但如果你在那之前找到的话
But if you find it before then...?

326
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,120
一切如常
Then life goes on.

327
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,720
日子就和以前一样
The same as it always has.

328
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:33,590
我的确停下了
I did stop.

329
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:34,650
在食堂
At the cafeteria.

330
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:36,860
收银员太性感了
The cashier is smokin'.

331
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:39,530
我可能愣了会神
I might have been distracted for a little while.

332
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:41,200
好的

药物应该提高自己的心律失常 不让情况变得更糟
The meds should've improved his arrhythmia, not made it worse.

357
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,020
也许还有其他问题
Maybe in addition to his other problems,

358
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,510
他有心内膜炎吗
Has he developed endocarditis?

359
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:28,120
超声检查显示他的瓣膜和心内膜

360
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:29,880
没有赘肉瘤

361
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:32,750
他没有发烧
He has not developed a fever.

362
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,280
还是小心为好  做个血培养

Notice anything on the food trays that wasn't food?

特百惠杯子  太阳眼镜  手机  一个避孕套
Tupperware, sunglasses, cellphones, a condom.

377
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:22,370
四点左右  我找到了个玻璃假眼
Around 4:00, I found a glass eye.

你有看到一个生物危害袋吗
You see a biohazard bag?

上面有红圈的自封袋吗

00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:28,160

跟我来
C'mon.

382
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:36,910
你可以动二尖瓣
You can move the mitral valve.

383
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:39,070
谢谢你的直观教具
Thanks for the visual aid.

384
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,850
你不能动二尖瓣
You can't move the mitral valve.

385
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:43,730
如果土豆先生有个房间隔的鼻子
Now, if Mr. Potato Head had an atrial septal nose

- and hypertrophic obstructive -- - I believe --

00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:48,840

389
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:58,800

Pretty sure I saw a biohazard bag in here yesterday.

390
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,320
你们很幸运现在过来找
You're lucky you came when you did.

391
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:03,000
因为两个小时后这些就会被倒掉
It's due to get dumped in two hours.

392
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,260
假牙  那最恶心了
Dentures. They're the worst.

393
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,840
每个病人都有一个标有名字的假牙杯
You know, every patient gets a denture cup with their name on it.

394
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,220
所以为什么他们的假牙从来都不放到杯子里
So, tell me, why are the dentures never in the cup?

395
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,060
就算放了  也是放错了杯子
And if they are, it's the wrong cup?

396
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:15,050
真是一大谜案
One of life's mysteries.

397
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,270
看到生物危害袋了
Biohazard bag sighting.

398
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,180
用生物危害袋当零钱袋
A biohazard bag for a coin purse?

399
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,120
认真的吗
Really?

400
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,500
最后  室间隔肌切开术
Finally, a septal myectomy

401
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,940
可以切开流出道
will open the outflow tract,

402
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:29,640
二尖瓣就可以被植入到
and the mitral valve can be re-implanted

403
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,560
一个更加正常的位置
into a more normal position.

404
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,760
谢谢  这是我的想法
Thank you. That's my idea.

405
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,860
你能在加布里尔身上做这个手术吗
Can you do this procedure on Gabriel?

406
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:36,610
不能
No.

407
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,740
这个主意很糟糕  没有用的
It's a terrible idea, and it won't work.

408
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:42,310
所以这是在演哪出
So, what was the point of this dog and pony show?

409
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,810
因为看起来你很热衷于替我做医学决定
'Cause you seemed keen on making medical decisions for me.

410
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:46,280
所以只是反抗而已
So just insubordination?

411
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,790
反正我们最后还是得来找你
And we were probably gonna wind up coming to you anyway.

412
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:51,400
一旦莫菲医生有一个想法  他都会坚持己见
Once Dr. Murphy gets an idea, he stays with it,

413
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,140
无论别人说什么
regardless of what anyone says.

414
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,780
是可以的
This can work.

415
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:56,900
是的  是可以的
Yes, this can work.

416
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,090
如果那孩子能活两小时  那真是个好主意
And it would be a great idea if the boy had two hours to live.

417
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:03,720
害怕失败是不这么做的一个好理由吗
Is fear of failure a good reason not to do this?

418
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:06,770
不
No.

419
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:08,980
但你知道什么是吗
But you know what is?

420
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:12,870
他本可以多活几年的想法...
The thought that he might have a few more birthdays...

421
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:15,150
或是交一个最好的朋友
or make a best friend.

422
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,750
我不知道  我不能让他死
I don't know. I'm not sending him home in a box.

423
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,230
我们得走了
We got to go.

424
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,170
加布里尔的心律不齐  越来越严重了
Gabriel's arrhythmia, it's gotten worse.

425
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:27,720
你还没找到
You still haven't found it?

426
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,900
我可以让普莱斯顿小姐来回答所有问题
I can get Ms. Preston to address any questions --

427
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,890
她没有参加手术  你参加了
She wasn't in the surgery. You were.

428
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,270
她负责所有的医疗事故
She is the point person for all therapeutic misadventures.

429
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:36,540
你在逗我吗
Are you kidding me?

430
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:40,970
我可能会毫无理由失声
I may lose my voice for absolutely no reason,

431
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:42,640
你却在用什么术语搪塞我
and you are using canned jargon.

432
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,170
样杯里的不是牙膏
That sample cup doesn't have toothpaste

433
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,170
袜子或者防晒霜  好吗
or socks or sunblock in it, okay?

434
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:48,260
是我的命啊
It has my life!

435
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:54,420
对不起
I'm sorry.

436
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,110
谢谢
Thank you.

437
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:07,590
-干得漂亮  -是啊
- Good for you. - Yeah, right.

438
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:10,030
-我刚刚违反了大概八条规定  -也许吧
- I just broke about eight rules. - Maybe.

439
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:12,040
我不会告诉「普莱斯顿小姐」的
"Ms. Preston" won't hear about it from me.

440
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,000
不过你应该把样本找到
You should go find that sample, though.

441
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,330
谢了
Thanks.

442
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:24,690
药不起作用  为什么
The meds aren't working. The question is why.

443
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:29,720
也许心律不齐只是
M-Maybe the arrhythmia is just another manifestation

444
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,180
加布里尔机能障碍的另一个表现
of Gabriel's L.V. Dysfunction.

445
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:34,510
我们至少还应该把这看成他异位的下降
We should still be seeing at least a modest decline in his ectopy.

446
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:36,000
也许他的梯度变化曲线不太好
Maybe his gradient is worse.

447
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,700
我们可以试试钙通道阻滞剂
We could try calcium channel blockers.

448
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,420
还有个更简单的解释
There's a much simpler explanation.

449
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:50,150
关于他的心内膜炎有个好消息
Good news about his endocarditis --

450
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:51,200
心脏炎症
heart inflammation.

451
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,480
他的检查很正常
His tests are normal.

452
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:54,730
但是我们还是很担心
But we still are concerned.

453
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:57,830
出于某种原因  他的药没起作用
For some reason, his medication isn't helping.

454
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:00,370
最好的解释就是...
Our best explanation is...

455
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,290
他没有吃药
he hasn't been taking his medication.

456
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,700
我是想救他的命
I am trying to save his life.

457
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:20,890
通过不给他吃药吗
But withholding his medicine?

458
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:22,530
通过把他留在这
By keeping him here.

459
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:25,200
如果他吃了药  变好了
If he takes the medicine and becomes better,

460
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,220
你是在送他去死
you send him to die.

461
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,570
但是我们只能做到这了
But there is nothing else that we can do for him here.

462
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:33,420
你不知道我生活的地方  那是什么样子
You do not understand where I live, what it is like.

463
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:36,340
我不了解你的村子
I don't know your village.

464
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,930
但是我知道穷是什么样的
But I do know what it's like to be poor.

465
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:42,890
我小时候家里很穷
I grew up with nothing.

466
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:44,480
我妹是残废
My sister was disabled.

467
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,000
我父母负担不起她的药物和治疗
My parents couldn't afford her meds or treatments.

468
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,120
看着她痛苦
And it killed them,

469
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:51,410
简直要了我父母和我的命
and me, to watch her suffer.

470
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:56,240
但是当没有办法的时候  真的是无能为力了
But when nothing can be done, nothing can be done.

471
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:59,510
你成为了一名医生
You became a doctor?

472
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:03,380
你没有安于贫穷
You did not accept being poor.

473
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,010
不
No.

474
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:10,050
那你一点都不了解
Then you do not understand at all.

475
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:15,410
我们什么都没有  食物
We want for everything -- food.

476
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,490
和平  药
Peace. Medicine.

477
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,840
但是我们最想要的是希望
But our greatest want is hope.

478
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:30,050
如果我们离开了  就没有希望了
If we leave here, we leave hope behind.

479
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:39,820
好吧
Okay.

480
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,580
我会尽力的
I'll do what I can.

481
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:48,670
我来看一下伊丽莎白
I dropped by to see Elizabeth.

482
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,560
毫不奇怪  她很沮丧
Not surprisingly, she's very upset.

483
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,630
我也不知道怎么安慰她
There wasn't much I could offer in the way of comfort.

484
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:54,270
要是人们都能各司其职就好了
If only people did their jobs.

485
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:55,520
什么人
Which people?

486
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:59,390
护士  送检员  化验室技术人员
Scrub nurses, couriers, lab techs...

487
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:01,500
这真是个奇怪的清单
That's a curiously limited list.

488
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:02,690
我的手术过程没有出错
I did the surgery correctly.

489
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:03,820
同样  我不认为要求别人做好自己的
I don't think it's too much to expect others

490
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,770
本职工作是一件过分的事情
to do their jobs correctly, as well.

491
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,680
所以  不是你的错  你没有问题
So, not your fault, not your problem.

492
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,500
你想做什么  让我觉得内疚吗
What are you trying to do, make me feel guilty?

493
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,020
是的  我希望你感觉很糟糕
Yes. I want you to feel horrible.

494
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:13,480
那是唯一会让你改变的事情
That's the only thing that's gonna make you change.

495
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,430
-变成什么  -我嫁的那个人
- Into what? - The guy I married.

496
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:18,580
那个关心病人大过于关心政治斗争的人
The guy who cared more about patients than politics.

497
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,980
我懂了
Okay, I get it.

498
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:22,780
你说的是我竞争医院院长的事情
This is about me vying for president of the hospital.

499
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:24,390
我们已经详细讨论过了
Which we discussed at length,

500
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:27,230
你也说你会百分之百支持我
which you said you were 100% behind me on.

501
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:28,980
我没意识到我落后你多远了
I didn't realize how far behind.

502
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:30,780
你认为我把你抛在身后了吗
You think I've left you behind?

503
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,130
周二
Tuesday --

504
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:38,010
「资本输出会议延迟了  我会晚到」
"Capital expenditures meeting delayed. Will be late."

505
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,890
-周四  -伊兹  关于我的工作
- Thursday -- - Iz, there are things about my job --

506
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:43,800
没错
Right.

507
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,430
「不是你的错」
"Not your fault."

508
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,560
<b>病理学</b>

509
00:23:58,690 --> 00:23:59,640
你好
Hello.

510
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:04,910
你知道福尔马林的样本都被送到同一个地方吗
Did you know that specimens in formalin go to one place,

511
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,870
除了其他地方的样本
exempt specimens somewhere else,

512
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:09,740
好氧和厌氧在不同的地方培养
aerobic and anaerobic cultures two different places?

513
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,950
放射性的  医疗设备
radioactive, medical device,

514
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,920
法医标本  都在不同地方
forensic specimens -- all different?

515
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,360
并且都被不同的员工处理
And all handled by different staff?

516
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,480
你知道吗
Did you know that?

517
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:18,320
知道
Yes.

518
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,430
我也做了一个表
I made a chart, too.

519
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:24,700
把你教我的东西做了一个定性观察日志
A qualitative observation log of what you taught me.

520
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:25,820
我教你的什么
What did I teach you?

521
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,770
调情
Flirting.

522
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,610
每次见到有人调情  我都记录下来
Every time I saw someone flirt, I noted it

523
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:33,620
然后对主客体以及非言语手势进行交叉对照
and cross-referenced the subject, object, and nonverbal gestures.

524
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,280
我就知道
I knew it.

525
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,790
收银的格温
Gwen, the cashier.

526
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,670
她声称都是送检员主动的  但
She made out that it was all the courier, but --

527
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:41,220
那是我的名字
That's my name.

528
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,760
是的  你也做了撩骚动作
Yes. You made flirting gestures.

529
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,480
-不  我没有  -你有
- No, I didn't. - Yes, you did.

530
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,120
你把头发往后撩了
You brushed your hair back.

531
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:50,460
用右手  单边撩
Right hand, side sweeping.

532
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:53,520
对梅伦德斯医生
At Dr. Melendez?

533
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,360
不  我不这么认为  肖恩
No, I don't think so. Shaun.

534
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:58,080
-我没有  -你有
- No. - Yes.

535
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,640
你在护士站
You were at the nurses station,

536
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,540
然后他说  「干得漂亮」
and he said, "Good for you,"

537
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:04,170
然后你说「是啊  我刚刚违反了大概八条规定」
and you said, "Yeright. I just broke about eight rules,"

538
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,750
然后你咯咯笑了  接着把头发往后撩
and smiled and giggled and brushed your hair back.

539
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,270
我不会告诉「普莱斯顿小姐」的
"Ms. Preston" Won't hear about it from me.

540
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,300
也可能你得了皮癣
It's possible you have ringworm.

541
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,320
肖恩  有时候人们撩头发
Shaun, sometimes people toss their hair

542
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:24,170
只是因为头发挡住脸了
just 'cause it's in their face.

543
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,130
莫菲
Murphy.

544
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:27,580
我想让你详细说明一下你的想法
I'd like you to elaborate on your idea.

545
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:29,470
我糟糕的想法
My terrible idea?

546
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,570
就是那个
That's the one.

547
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:47,800
你可以移动瓣膜的前叶  然后重新接上
You can move the anterior leaflet of the valve and reattach it.

548
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:49,960
不  我们不能
No, we can't.

549
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:52,820
这是那个孩子心脏的精准复制
This is an exact replica of the kid's heart,

550
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,460
没有固定点可以用来重新接上
and there's no anchor point to reattach it.

551
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,990
所以你的那部分想法还是很糟糕
So that part of your idea is still terrible.

552
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:58,960
好吧
Okay.

553
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:02,120
但是剩下的呢
But the rest of it?

554
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,840
我们在处理一个巨大的隔膜
We're dealing with a huge septum --

555
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,130
有25毫米
25 millimeters.

556
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,790
对一个健康的孩子来说是多大
What would that number be in a healthy kid?

557
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:07,870
大约8毫米
About 8.

558
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:09,680
如果我们想接近8毫米
If we go anywhere near that number,

559
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,130
对瓣膜来说就没有足够的支撑
we won't have enough support for the valve.

560
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:19,180
但是如果说我们减小到20毫米
But let's say we took that down to 20...

561
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:22,520
那对于减轻出口梗阻来说就会不够了
That won't be enough to relieve the outflow obstruction.

562
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:26,610
好吧
Okay.

563
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:28,470
18毫米
18.

564
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,060
好
Okay.

565
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,580
<b>仪器</b>

566
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,000
我们岔开他的旁路
Let's take him off bypass.

567
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,220
<b>旁路</b>

568
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:40,540
他死了
He's dead.

569
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:42,340
再来一次  16毫米
Again. 16.

570
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:44,850
我真的好累
I'm really tired.

571
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:48,430
我曾经想过
I used to think that

572
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:51,750
我要成为史上最好的外科医生
I wanted to be the best surgeon in history.

573
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:53,110
但我新的目标
But my new goal?

574
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:57,030
只是希望不要在实习期就被刷掉
Is just not to get washed out of my residency.

575
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:01,360
你现在有手术吗
You have a surgery now?

576
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:03,300
没有
No.

577
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,950
我来看看有什么需要帮忙的
I'm here to see how I can help.

578
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:07,490
外科主任来参加搜寻派对
The Chief of Surgery joining the search party?

579
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:08,510
我是不是应该来个自拍
Should I take a selfie,

580
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:10,630
给我的朋友们看看发生了什么
show my friends that this really happened?

581
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:11,870
这是团队的问题
This is a team problem.

582
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:13,200
所以应该团队一起解决
It should be a team solution.

583
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,200
你是怎么有这么好的领导的
How do you get a boss like this?

584
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,400
现在我们知道什么
What do we know so far?

585
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:25,120
我们岔开他的旁路
Let's take him off bypass.

586
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:39,640
血液流出量在13毫米的时候很完美
His outflow is perfect at 13 millimeters.

587
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:42,490
但当左房室瓣没有足够的支撑
Which is irrelevant when the mitral valve...

588
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:44,560
去关闭时  这无关紧要
...doesn't have enough support to close.

589
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:46,560
他死了
He's dead.

590
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,680
再一次
Again.

591
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:52,330
布朗医生
Dr. Browne.

592
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:56,180
关于你代表医院承担责任并告诉伊丽莎白你很抱歉
Any reason you assumed responsibility on behalf of the hospital...

593
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,400
这件事有什么解释吗
told Elizabeth you were "Sorry"?

594
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:01,890
因为我确实抱歉
Because I was.

595
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:08,730
希望这样做不会付出什么代价
Well, I hope we don't see the price tag on that.

596
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:13,080
并且你没有时间了
And I think you're out of time.

597
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:22,990
我们岔开他的旁路
Let's take him off bypass.

598
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,380
<b>旁路</b>

599
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,150

Yes.

14 millimeters.

601
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:42,660

00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:44,220

Yeah.

603
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:45,600
精确
Exactly.

604
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:52,110
我们的误差幅度极低
Our margin of error is exceedingly low.

605
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,340
运气好
Good luck.

606
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,300
你相信运气吗
You believe in luck?

607
00:29:56,390 --> 00:30:00,290
这是人们在很困难的情况下会说的
It's something people say in difficult situations.

608
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:03,970
我也不信
Neither do I.

609
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:05,530
再来一次
Again.

610
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:10,460
事实是  即使我们现在找到了你的样品
The reality is, even if we found your specimen now,

611
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,310
很可能已经没有活性了
it's unlikely that it'd still be viable.

612
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:19,200
你不知道我是否得了癌症
You don't know if I have cancer,

613
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:22,280
也没有办法能知道
and there's no way to find out.

614
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:29,430
所以我的选择就是去做我可能不需要做的手术
So my choices are surgery I may not need...

615
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:33,310
可能会让我无法说话
...that will leave me without speech,

616
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:37,160
或者什么都不做  然后可能死去
or I do nothing and maybe die.

617
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:40,200
很不幸  是的
Unfortunately, yes.

We must not have seen it at 14

678
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:22,400

I'll read the cases, check the containers,

693
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,090
现在说你的话就太混蛋了
and feel like a jerk for judging you.

694
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:09,310
我要是对的  你才是混蛋
Well, you're only a jerk if I'm right.

695
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,120
泵送时间
Pump time?

696
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,830
6小时48分
6 hours, 48 minutes.

697
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:22,360
叫梅达进来
Get Mehta in here.

698
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:25,680
切断他的体外循环
Let's take him off bypass.

699
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:56,880
12秒
12 seconds.

700
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,970
要去拿电极板吗
Should I get the paddles?

701
00:36:58,070 --> 00:36:59,080
等等
Not yet.

702
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,780
加油啊  加布里尔
Come on, Gabriel.

703
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,650
他体外循环多久了
How long has he been on bypass?

704
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:05,350
几乎超时两小时  得助推启动...
Nearly two hours too long. We need to jump-start --

705
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:06,430
等等
Not yet!

706
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:16,730
好
Yeah.

707
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:18,220
太好了
Yes!

708
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,970
莫菲医生  缝合吧
Dr. Murphy, close him up.

在你手术前手术室有个样本杯
There was a specimen cup in the O.R. prior to your surgery.

728
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,870
原本是取子弹时要用的
It was supposed to be used for a bullet removal,

729
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,530
结果子弹留在了体内
but they left the bullet in the body,

730
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:31,520
然后杯子不小心用来装你的样本了
and the cup was used accidentally for your specimen.

731
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,560
不仅把样本泡在了福尔马林里

还被冷冻起来  十分鲜活

你好
Hello.

747
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:24,070
我今天过得很不错
I had a very good day today.

748
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:24,940
是啊  没错
Yes, you did.

749
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:26,290
手术太精彩
That was a hell of an operation.

750
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:27,200
对
Yes.

751
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:29,100
我还看到克莱尔撩骚
And I caught Claire flirting.

752
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,120
撩你吗
With you?

753
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,200
肖恩  我想你可能误...
Shaun, I think you might be mis--

754
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,690
撩梅伦德斯医生
With Dr. Melendez.

755
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:34,210
梅伦德斯医生
Dr. Melendez.

756
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:35,730
我进行了观察
I conducted observations,

757
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:38,110
读懂了  然后记录了下来
successfully interpreted them, and logged them.

758
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:40,540
电子表上的浪漫
Romance in a spreadsheet.

759
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:41,620
我喜欢
I love it.

760
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:45,730
克莱尔没读懂的暗示我却读懂了
I was aware of the cues even when Claire wasn't.

761
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:48,250
我想她需要生活技能指导
I think she needs a life-skills coach.

762
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:49,740
推断
Extrapolating.

763
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:50,760
我也喜欢
I like that, too.

764
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,740
很好  肖恩
That's great, Shaun.

765
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:53,900
你在观察周围  在学习
You're paying attention. You're learning.

766
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:58,210
等给你找到懂时尚的生活指导
And when we find you a life coach, one with a fashion sense,

767
00:39:58,210 --> 00:39:59,730
你就能学得更好
then you're gonna be learning better,

768
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,450
你会学得更快
you're gonna be learning faster.

769
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:06,660
你要放弃我了吗
Are you giving up on me?

770
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,010
什么
What?

771
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:11,690
不  我没有放弃你
No. I haven't given up on you.

772
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:14,190
我不要陌生人帮我
I don't want a stranger helping me.

773
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:18,250
我知道  肖恩  但...
I know, Shaun. But...

774
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,790
我不能...
And I can't...

775
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:25,220
我不能一直陪伴你  我...
I can't always be there. I-I..

776
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:28,530
我不能一直给予你你需要的帮助
I can't always help you the way you need to be helped,

777
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:30,580
你应该得到的帮助
the way you deserve to be helped.

778
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:32,980
我不要陌生人帮我
I don't want a stranger helping me.

779
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,490
恭喜
Congratulations.

780
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:49,020
你也是
You too.

781
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,220
你疯狂的侦探技术
On your mad sleuthing skills.

782
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:54,200
如果对外科腻烦了  还有这个退路
Something to fall back on if this surgery thing gets old.

783
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,960
你做得很棒  克莱尔
You did a nice job, Claire.

784
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,450
-谢谢  -这是我们的代价
- Thanks. - And here is our price tag.

785
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:01,810
我们收到传票了
We've been served.

786
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:04,510
但我们找到了  伊丽莎白没事
But we found it. Elizabeth's fine.

787
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:05,440
我知道
I know.

788
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,260
但我们让她痛苦了两天
But we put her through two days of hell,

789
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:09,550
她想确保别人不会有这种遭遇
and she wants to make sure it doesn't happen to anybody else.

790
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,610
她干得好
I mean, good for her.

791
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,490
这是什么
What is this?

792
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:18,140
加布里尔的起搏器
Gabriel's pacemaker.

793
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:20,100
我听说你今天又发光了
I heard you were brilliant again today.

794
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,500
我运气好
I got lucky.

795
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:31,520
如果我养刺猬做宠物  楼管会杀了我吗
Do you think Armen would kill me if I got a pet hedgehog?

796
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:32,750
我看书写它们其实挺...
I mean, I read that they're actually pretty --

797
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:34,520
-莉亚  -怎么了  肖恩
- Lea. - Yes, Shaun?

798
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:38,760
这毛衣不太适合你
You look absurd in that sweater.

799
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:46,830
我有苹果
I have apples.

800
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:49,160
你要吃苹果吗
Do you want an apple?

801
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:53,350
好
Yeah.
