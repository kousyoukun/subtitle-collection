1
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,840
那是谁啊
So, who was that?

2
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,150
管家
A housekeeper.

3
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,370
早上七点才从你家出来
Leaving your place at 7:00 in the morning?

4
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:18,750
我在面试她
I was interviewing her.

5
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,990
你住单间公寓都要请管家
You're hiring a housekeeper for a studio apartment?

6
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:22,190
我不会请她
I'm not hiring her.

7
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:23,680
她的着装不合格
Her clothes don't match.

8
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:24,470
好吧
Right.

9
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,850
你太混球了  肖恩·莫菲
You're such an asshat, Shaun Murphy.

10
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,350
今天我们梦想成真
Today we realize a dream --

11
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,340
我们的国际人道主义项目终于开花结果
seeing our international humanitarian program come to fruition.

12
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:48,570
我们的心胸外科医生  尼尔·梅伦德斯医生
Our cardiothoracic surgeon, Dr. Neil Melendez,

13
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:53,200
与首席心脏科医生艾威·梅达协商
in consultation with our head cardiologist, Dr. Avi Mehta,

14
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:57,470
评估了坦桑尼亚  马拉维和几内亚的儿童
evaluated children from Tanzania to Malawi to Guinea.

15
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:59,590
他们筛选了百余名候选者
They screened over 100 candidates,

16
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:01,640
每个孩子都需要进行救命的手术
each of them needing life-saving surgeries.

17
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,970
我们最终选中了一位格外鼓舞人心的小男孩
Ultimately, we decided on a particularly inspiring young boy

18
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:05,910
他叫加布里尔
named Gabriel,

19
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:08,470
来自刚果民主共和国
who hails from the Democratic Republic of Congo,

20
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,970
他有严重的先天性心脏畸形
with severe congenital heart anomalies.

21
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,190
我们有三位完全符合要求的候选者
We identified three perfect candidates --

22
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,420
-都是我能真正救治的孩子  -谢谢
- children I can actually help. - Hi. Thank you.

23
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:18,590
-加布里尔不在其中  -算是吧
- Gabriel wasn't one of them. - Yes and no.

24
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,010
我赞同你的选择
I signed off on your choices.

25
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:21,880
但鉴于我看到的超声心动图
But I wouldn't have necessarily eliminated Gabriel

26
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:23,180
我是不会剔除加布里尔的
based on the echo I saw.

27
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,760
非外科医生人员竟然
A non-surgeon undermining a surgeon

28
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:26,670
否定真正外科医生的手术决定
on his selection of surgical candidates.

29
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:29,620
同事间就各自的决定提出意见是好事
It's healthy when colleagues challenge each others' decisions.

30
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:30,750
简直是乱来啊
It doesn't make any sense.

31
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,110
我们选好了手术候选者
We gave you good candidates.

32
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:32,920
你又不是医生
You're not a doctor.

33
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,580
你怎么就不按照单子来呢
Why wouldn't you stick with the list?

34
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:36,950
有一些不可控因素
There were several intangibles.

35
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,580
给梅伦德斯医生打招呼
Can you say hi to Dr. Melendez?

36
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:45,580
我想某个不可控因素就是孩子很可爱
One of those intangibles, I'm guessing, is cuteness.

37
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:53,380
{an8\b0\pos(183,215)\fad(500,500)\fn方正黑体_GBK\fs42\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HBDC0BD&\2c&HFFFFFF&\4c&HBBBEBB&}良     医

38
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:53,380
{an8\b0\pos(237,125)\fad(500,500)\fn方正黑体_GBK\fs22\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HBDC0BD&\2c&HFFFFFF&\4c&HBBBEBB&}第一季    第九集

39
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,870
战争害他们流离失所
Family displaced during the war.

40
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:01,380
母亲一直照料着丈夫
Mother took care of her husband

41
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,710
直到丈夫死于黄热病
until he died of yellow fever.

42
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:03,910
他在家血流而亡
He bled out at home.

43
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,390
一个月后  加布里尔出生了
A month later, Gabriel was born.

44
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,620
当一件事不仅看着高尚  而且有新闻效应时
People tend to give more when the cause is not only noble,

45
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,920
人们才愿捐更多
but photogenic,

46
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,920
可爱的孩子和可怜的母亲或许能打动捐赠者
Adorable kids and sympathetic moms may work on donors,

47
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,930
但对我来说没用
but they won't work on me,

48
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,850
也肯定过不了超声心动图这关
and they certainly won't work on echo results.

49
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:21,120
起码过得了我这关
Kinda working on me.

50
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,290
在你说不行之前  至少做一下病情检查
Before you say no, at least do your own work-up.

51
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:35,430
妈妈  怎么不带我去
Mommy, why can't I come?

52
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:38,030
医院担心小孩会带来细菌
The hospital's worried that children bring in germs.

53
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,680
不会的  妈妈  我保证
I won't, Mommy. I promise.

54
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,630
我知道  宝贝  但这就是规定
I know, boo. It's just -- It's the rules.

55
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,350
宝贝  我得挂了
Okay, baby. I have to go now.

56
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:46,630
听玛吉阿姨的话  晚点打给你  好吗
Do what Aunt Maggie says. I'll call you later, okay?

57
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,000
我对你的爱长到月亮
I love you to the moon...

58
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,600
还要再回来
And back.

59
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,180
跟三岁的孩子聊语音放松不太容易吧
I can't imagine voice rest could be very easy with a 3-year-old.

60
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:55,130
没错  对我的播客听众也不太有用
Yeah. Not very effective for my podcast audience either.

61
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:57,160
对了  我也是你的忠实粉丝
Of which, by the way, I'm a huge fan.

62
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,090
很讽刺吧
Grim irony, though, right?

63
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,380
播主失声
A podcaster who loses her voice.

64
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:04,220
伊丽莎白  这肯定是个良性肿瘤
Elizabeth, I'm sure the nodule will be benign

65
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:07,030
这只会启发你又创作出一集精彩的节目
and this'll be nothing more than an inspiration for another great episode.

66
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,830
要不是良性呢  伊莎贝尔
If it's not benign, Isabel?

67
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:09,820
别想太多了
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

68
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,760
今天就专心摘除结节
Today we're just focused on removing the nodule

69
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,740
然后做活检
and doing the biopsy.

70
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,040
你已经尽力了
And you've done everything you could do.

71
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,210
而且你一发现声音嘶哑了
And when the hoarseness started,

72
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:17,010
就来最好的医院求治
you sought early care from the best.

73
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,310
我也派了最好的医生
And I sent you to the best.

74
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,360
你俩是完美搭档
You work perfectly together,

75
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,260
就像左右手一样配合完美
kind of ping and pong-ish.

76
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:23,590
很好
It's nice.

77
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,980
很多医生夫妻档
A lot of doctors who are married

78
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:26,790
更像是彼此的保险
are more like miss and match.

79
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,420
邦格乌拉夫人  这是莫菲医生和卡卢医生
Mrs. Bangura, this is Dr. Murphy and Dr. Kalu.

80
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,510
他们来帮我给加布里尔做些检查
They're gonna help me run some tests on Gabriel.

81
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,620
听说你和加布里尔
I heard that you and Gabriel

82
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,990
之前从没出过远门
have never been away from home before.

83
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:38,860
但愿这能让他感到我们的友好
I was hoping that these would make him feel welcome.

84
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,460
是啊  你真好
Yes. You are kind.

85
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,400
我也给自己买了一个
I brought one for myself, too.

86
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,570
我们来检查一下吧
How 'bout we all do some medicine?

87
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,390
他真的需要我们帮忙
He really needs our help.

88
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,610
「他需要我们帮忙」
"He needs our help"?

89
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,840
他的胸口听着像装了个吹风机
He sounds like he's got a blow dryer in his chest.

90
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,780
没错  所以他需要我们帮忙
Exactly. Which is why he needs our help.

91
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,240
这就是心脏科医生的毛病
This is the problem with cardiologists --

92
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,330
你们真的很擅长通知病患哪里有问题
You're really good at telling people when something's broken,

93
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:20,940
却搞不清楚什么时候无法救治
not so good at knowing when they can't be fixed.

94
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,960
只有等完全确定那孩子救不活了
If that kid is dying, I'm not gonna tell his mother that

95
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,240
我才会通知他母亲
unless I'm damn sure.

96
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,090
你听到心音了
You heard that heart.

97
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,220
我也听到了
I heard that heart.

98
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,660
心音很糟糕
And it sounded like crap.

99
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,700
在做经食管超声心动检查之前
But until we do a transesophageal echo,

100
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,140
一切都是未知
I don't know anything.

101
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,370
做经食管超声心动检查
Do a transesophageal echo.

102
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,960
她有社会学博士学位
She has a master's degree in Sociology,

103
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,330
信誉完美  推荐信很优秀
impeccable credentials, excellent references,

104
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:49,620
你却因为「她的着装不合格」而拒绝她
and you turned her away because "Her clothes didn't match"?

105
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,610
关系可大了
It's relevant.

106
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:54,170
要是生活技能指导选不出配套的衣服
If a life-skills coach can't select a complementing wardrobe,

107
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:55,290
那就是生活无能
they lack life skills.

108
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:57,210
但她不会给你搭配衣服啊
But she's not gonna pick out your clothes for you.

109
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:58,550
她又不是保姆
She's not a nanny.

110
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,270
她只是来帮你解决
She's there to help you with problem-solving,

111
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,750
经济和社交问题的
financial, social interactions.

112
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,050
你这么做是因为我没处理好
You're doing this because I did not react well

113
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:07,190
我在逛商店时遇到的持枪抢劫
to a man with a gun robbing a store I was in.

114
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,890
从统计上看  我不太可能再遇到那种事了
Statistically, that is very unlikely to ever happen to me again.

115
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:14,440
你会一次又一次地遇到社交互动
Social interactions will happen again and again and again.

116
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,390
这是统计学都不能否定的
It's statistically irrefutable.

117
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,230
如果你学会如何更好地跟人打交道
And if you learn how to get along with people

118
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:21,190
你的人生会更充实  更快乐
a little bit better, you'll have a fuller life. A happier life.

119
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,450
你要是不喜欢她  再找就是
If you don't like this woman, we'll find somebody else.

120
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:24,910
我很快乐
I am happy.

121
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,880
你可以更快乐
You could be happier.

122
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,010
我不觉得
I don't think so.

123
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,740
我的邻居莉亚
My neighbor, Lea.

124
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:33,610
她要是遇到火灾  肯定最先被救出去
If she were ever in a fire, she'd be rescued first.

125
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:34,660
为什么
Why's that?

126
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:38,190
梅伦德斯医生说有魅力的人有优势
Dr. Melendez says attractive people have advantages.

127
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:40,800
梅伦德斯医生说的吗
Dr. Melendez says that, does he?

128
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,060
有什么好笑的
Why is that funny?

129
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,710
不知道  只是
I don't know. It's just, um,

130
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:47,060
有人觉得梅伦德斯医生很有魅力
some people consider Dr. Melendez attractive.

131
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,900
你跟莉亚情况如何
So, how's it going with Lea?

132
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,130
她不喜欢我
She doesn't like me.

133
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,330
何出此言
Why do you say that?

134
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:58,540
-她说我是个混球  -是吗
- She said I was an asshat. - Yeah?

135
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,460
她说这话时有什么动作
What was she doing when she said that?

136
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:03,210
-打了我一下  -她是在撩你呢
- Touching me. - She was flirting with you.

137
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:06,180
有时人们会故意说反话
Sometimes people say the opposite of what they mean.

138
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,390
他们用开玩笑的语气
They use teasing as a way

139
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,910
说出一些违心的话
of saying something they don't mean

140
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,960
而不会说出真想表达的意思
instead of saying something that they do.

141
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,960
我还没遇到把说反话
I haven't seen any data on the use of antonyms

142
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,320
当成调情技巧的情况
as a flirting technique.

143
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,360
好  注意看哈
Okay. Well, um, here's what to look for.

144
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,810
-准备好了  -好了
- You ready? - Yes.

145
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,540
好  矫揉造作的笑
Okay. The pretentious giggle.

146
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,430
扭动身体
The, uh -- the squirm.

147
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,620
还有撩头发
And the hair sweep.

148
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,120
这叫做撩骚三重奏
I call it the flirting trifecta.

149
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,650
动物和人都会摩挲毛发  克莱尔
Hair scuffing is used in both animals and humans, Claire.

150
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,460
头皮和毛皮上都有分泌腺
Secreting glands are located in the scalp and fur.

151
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,980
摩挲毛发会把荷尔蒙释放到空气中
Scuffing sends hormones out into the environment

152
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,140
以便告知潜在对象自己有兴趣
to let a potential mate know they're interested.

153
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:45,550
也可能是皮癣
Or it could be ringworm.

154
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,390
好吧
Yeah.

155
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:49,680
看来你非得把那种可能归为原因之一
I suppose you have to factor for that possibility.

156
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,500
有品位
Nice touch.

157
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,020
美貌增加幸福值  幸福值提升颜值
Beauty increases happiness. Happiness improves outlook.

158
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:59,500
-还要及时行乐  -你要不要试试
- Still on Mission Carpe Diem. - You might want to try it.

159
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:00,710
不用了
I'm doing fine.

160
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,140
我们在水槽边吃晚餐
We're having dinner at the sink.

161
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:04,340
不  我们是在水槽边享受晚餐
No, we're enjoying dinner at the sink.

162
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,860
但如果你继续那样说话...
Although if you keep talking like that...

163
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,330
我是安德鲁斯
Andrews.

164
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,440
那就再找找  肯定在那
Well, look again. It has to be there.

165
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,720
好的
Yeah. Okay.

166
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,560
谁的电话
Who was that?

167
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:19,640
化验室
The lab.

168
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,210
他们找不到伊丽莎白的样本了
They misplaced Elizabeth's specimen.

169
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,060
-天呐  -别担心  他们会找到的
- Oh, my God. - Don't worry. They'll find it.

170
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,190
满意了
Satisfied?

171
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:28,380
-肯定在哪里  -反正不在这儿
- It's somewhere. - Somewhere else.

172
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,390
你们手术室的人就喜欢把责任推给化验室
I love how everyone in surgery is so fast to blame the lab.

173
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,150
多检查几遍总不为过
Well, double-checking can't hurt.

174
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,240
那可说不准
Actually it can.

175
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,030
你该多检查几遍手术室
Because you are here

176
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,680
但你却跑来这里
when you should be double-checking surgery.

177
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,070
我亲眼看到样本放进样本盒里了
I saw the specimen go in the container.

178
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:40,450
那就说明样本应该在这里
It means it has to be here.

179
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:43,270
不  那只能说明样本被放进样本盒里了
No, all that means is that it was put in a container.

180
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,200
可是不能说明样本盒
It doesn't mean that that container

181
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,170
被放进手术室的冰柜里了
was actually put in the surgery refrigerator

182
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:48,510
也不能说明送检员拿到了样本
or that it was actually picked up by the courier.

183
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:50,460
他的病情比我们想象的还要严重
He's even worse than we thought.

184
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,410
是啊
Yeah.

185
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,490
肥厚型梗阻性心肌病
Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy,

186
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:55,950
房间隔缺损
atrial septal defect,

187
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:58,660
二尖瓣瓣膜异常插入
abnormal insertion of the mitral valve leaflet.

188
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,840
我还从没见过一颗心脏能出这么多毛病
I've never seen so many anomalies in one heart.

189
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,700
很抱歉我要求做了些额外的检查
I'm sorry I pushed for additional testing.

190
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,890
那是他妈妈所希望的
That only got his mother's hopes up.

191
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,690
有什么药物可以使用
Any medication that'll help?

192
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:14,510
β受体阻滞剂
Beta blockers.

193
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,870
或许  美托洛尔
Maybe metoprolol.

194
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,640
这些药物无法帮他重返足球场
It's not like they'll get him playing soccer,

195
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,900
但至少可以让他到球场边看看比赛
but they might help him get to the field to watch.

196
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:21,800
反正他只有几年可活了
For a couple of years, anyway.

197
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,290
总比明天死在手术台上要好
Better than dying on a table tomorrow.

198
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:27,260
你来告诉青木
You tell Aoki.

199
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,110
我去告诉他妈妈
I'll break it to the mom.

200
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:39,200
利普曼医生请到整形外科手术室
Dr. Lippman to plastic surgery.

201
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,600
利普曼医生请到整形外科手术室
Dr. Lippman to plastic surgery.

202
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:55,850
这叫卡拉  是我们部落的萨满送的
It's called sakara, given by our shaman.

203
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,630
他的心跳
His heartbeat...

204
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,900
随这乐声而动
it follows the sound.

205
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,690
确保在你们修补好之前  心脏还能跳动
It reminds it to beat until you fix it.

206
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:10,490
邦格乌拉夫人  检查已经全部做完了
Mrs. Bangura, I've completed all the tests.

207
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:12,160
很抱歉地告诉你这一趟...
And I'm sorry that you've come all this way --

208
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,710
加布里尔在我肚子里的时候
When Gabriel was in my belly,

209
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:15,850
恶灵降临到他身上
evil spirits came to him.

210
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,390
侵蚀他的心脏
Invade his heart.

211
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:21,520
我们部落的萨满试图将恶灵驱逐
Our village shaman tried to rid them.

212
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:23,700
但他失败了
He could not.

213
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:28,370
之后他看到了一幕幻象
Then a vision came to him.

214
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,710
一个强大的医者将会来临
A stronger healer would come.

215
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,290
就是你
You.

216
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:39,490
你会拯救加布里尔
You will save Gabriel.

217
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43,420
我不知道什么恶灵
I don't know about evil spirits.

218
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:47,380
我只知道你的儿子有先天性心脏病
All I know is that your son was born

219
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,950
而且我无法医治
with a heart that I can't fix.

220
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:50,270
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

221
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:53,210
如果我不相信  我根本不能撑到现在
I would not have come so far if I did not believe.

222
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,370
我们会给他药物治疗缓解他的痛苦
We'll give him medicine to make him feel better.

223
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,130
之后你可以带他回家了
And then you can take him home.

224
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:27,950
我们说我们很抱歉
We tell her we're sorry,

225
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,760
到现在仍然没有进展  然后
we have no news yet, and then --

226
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,680
不行  你不能这么说
Nope. You can't say that.

227
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,750
这个词不能轻易说出口
It's an expensive word.

228
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,090
-「抱歉」吗  -你可以表现得很抱歉
- "Sorry"? - You can act sorry.

229
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:35,080
你可以感到抱歉
You can feel sorry.

230
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,400
事实上  你应该为此感到抱歉
In fact, you should feel sorry.

231
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,530
但你就是不能说出来
You just can't say it.

232
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:39,520
好吧  「我们很遗憾
Okay, uh, "I feel bad for you

233
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,400
-因为我们犯了个错误」  -不行
- because we made a mistake and --" - Nope.

234
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,960
这难道不是错误吗
A mistake isn't a mistake?

235
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:46,950
这是「由预计的行为所造成的意想不到的结果」
Well, it's "An unanticipated outcome of an expected action."

236
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:49,420
你不能用语言暗示出这种行为该受到谴责
You can't use language that implies blameworthy conduct.

237
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:52,610
但如果我们真的弄丢了样本  这不是错误吗
But if we did lose the specimen, isn't it actually a mistake,

238
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,260
我们难道不应该为此抱歉  为此受到谴责吗
and aren't we sorry, and aren't we blameworthy?

239
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,650
应该
Yes.

240
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:58,220
但这可不能让我们轻松搞定她的律师
Doesn't mean we can make it any easier for her attorney.

241
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,410
你好  伊丽莎白
Hello, Elizabeth.

242
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:04,060
我是风险管理部门的杰西卡·普莱斯顿
I'm Jessica Preston from Risk Management.

243
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:04,920
你怎么样
How are you?

244
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,190
这个职位听起来不太妙
I don't like the sound of that.

245
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:08,570
我知道  我的确需要一个新的  新的头衔
I know. I really need a new -- a new job title.

246
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,420
我们似乎遇到了一些意料之外的情况
Seems that we've encountered an unexpected occurrence.

247
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,160
化验室找不到你的组织样本了
The laboratory has been unable to locate your tissue specimen.

248
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,870
我们不想引起你不必要的惊慌
We don't want you to be unnecessarily alarmed,

249
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:19,230
但我们希望你能充分了解事情的进展
but we want you to be fully aware of what's going on.

250
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:22,240
但是  如果你们找不到样本
But ho-- How will I know if I have cancer

251
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,530
我怎么知道我是不是患了癌症
if you don't find it?

252
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:25,050
我们正在四处寻找
We are looking everywhere.

253
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,190
我们会找到的
We will find it.

254
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:28,370
只要样本还泡在福尔马林里或还在冰柜里
As long as it's in formalin or a refrigerator,

255
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:29,400
就没事
everything will be fine.

256
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,420
可以存放多久
For how long?

257
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,880
至少24小时  甚至36小时
At least 24 hours. Maybe even 36.

258
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,410
那你们最好给我找到
Well, then you better find it.

259
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,630
如果因为有人搞砸了
Because I will be damned

260
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,270
而导致我的声带被切除
if I'm gonna have my voice box removed

261
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,840
我绝不原谅
just because somebody screwed up.

262
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,900
我实施了一项积极的教育计划
I've implemented a proactive educational plan.

263
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,570
那很好  肖恩
Well, that's terrific, Shaun.

264
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,140
为什么你在这里提这个
Why are we talking about that here?

265
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:00,480
我可不傻
I'm not stupid.

266
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:02,730
我没说你傻  肖恩
I didn't say you were stupid, Shaun.

267
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:03,800
没人说你傻
Nobody said you were stupid.

268
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,240
只是有时候你缺乏常识
But sometimes you lack common sense.

269
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,860
打扰到你我很抱歉
I'm so sorry to have bothered you.

270
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,610
这位患者听不到
This patient is deaf.

271
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:19,140
我昨天上了调情课
I started flirting lessons yesterday.

272
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,860
调情课
Flirting lessons.

273
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,960
要是我年轻的时候有这样的课就好了
Wish they'd had that when I was young.

274
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:26,090
是的  我学了撩骚三重奏
Yes, I learned about the flirting trifecta.

275
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,990
包括矫揉造作的笑
There's the pretentious giggle.

276
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:29,390
肖恩  你在说什么
Shaun, what are you getting at?

277
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:31,750
调情
Flirting,

278
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:36,070
首先需要非语言性的交流
it requires primarily nonverbal interactions.

279
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:38,370
洞察感知某一社会层面
Being perceptive in one social dimension

280
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,570
然后再将其翻译成其它的社交技巧
translates well to other social skills.

281
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,090
你在学习撩妹
You're studying flirting.

282
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,820
你觉得孤单吗  肖恩
Are you lonely, Shaun?

283
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,750
你知道现在有很多网站  在那上面你可以...
'Cause you know there are... There are websites now where you can --

284
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,370
我喜欢一个人
I like being alone.

285
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:54,660
好  但一个人和孤单是两回事
Yeah, well, being alone and being lonely are two different things.

286
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,290
有时我们很孤单  但自己却浑然不知
Sometimes we're lonely, and we don't even know it.

287
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,530
那我怎么能知道
How would I know it?

288
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:05,860
孤单  是一种阴郁的...
Well, uh, loneliness, it's kind of a dull...

289
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,120
就像是黑暗的...
It's like a dark...

290
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,370
你孤单吗
Are you lonely?

291
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:16,270
有时候
Yeah, sometimes.

292
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,130
有时候非常孤单
You know, sometimes very much.

293
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,780
那你应该学学撩骚三重奏
You should learn the trifecta.

294
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:34,840
我们在找一份丢失的样本
We're looking for a lost specimen

295
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,620
我很确定它不在手术室
that I am positive left the O.R.

296
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,200
我也很确定它没有被送到化验室
And I'm positive it didn't make it to the lab.

297
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,840
既然你是连接这两个地方的纽带
And since you're the link between the two,

298
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:42,480
所以我们想问问你昨天下午三点送的那趟
we wanted to ask you about your 3:00 run yesterday.

299
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:43,780
所以  你是不是
So, you took everything

300
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,710
把放在手术室冰箱里的所有东西都拿走了
that was in the refrigerator in the O.R.?

301
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:47,500
在冰箱里的  不在冰箱里的
In the refrigerator, out of the refrigerator.

302
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,740
所有该拿走的我都拿走了
Everything that's meant to go, I took.

303
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,630
-你有在路上停留吗  -没有
- Did you stop on the way? -No.

304
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,310
按照规定  直接从手术室送到化验室了
Straight from the surgery to the lab, just like the rules say.

305
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:54,880
你有没有去卫生间
Well, did you stop at the restroom

306
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:56,910
或者  咖啡机  咖啡厅
or the -- the coffee machine, the cafeteria?

307
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:57,650
不管你们信不信
You know, believe it or not,

308
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:58,630
我可以走完三十分钟的路程
I can go a whole 30 minutes

309
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,300
中途不会停下来吃奶油泡芙
without stopping for a cream puff.

310
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:01,610
我们走投无路了
We're just desperate.

311
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:02,960
我们关心的就只有样本
All we care about is the specimen

312
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,790
以及避免上级全面调查
and avoiding a full-on investigation.

313
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,690
调查
Investigation?

314
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,550
是的  是的  是的
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

315
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,900
如果我们找不到的话
I-I-I-If we don't find it,

316
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,880
法务部门就会介入
then the legal department gets involved.

317
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,310
每个接触过的人
Everyone who was in contact with it,

318
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:16,070
每个可能接触过的人
who might have been in contact with it

319
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:17,830
都会被调查
goes under a magnifying glass.

320
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:18,790
我可不想这样
I'm not looking forward to it.

321
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,820
你想这样吗  她反正不想
You looking forward to it? She's not looking forward to it.

322
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,950
他们会查看你的社交媒体  你的电脑
They're gonna check your social media, your computer.

323
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:25,280
-血检  -血检
- Blood tests. - Blood tests.

324
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:27,810
但如果你在那之前找到的话
But if you find it before then...?

325
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:28,950
一切如常
Then life goes on.

326
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:30,550
日子就和以前一样
The same as it always has.

327
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,420
我的确停下了
I did stop.

328
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,480
在食堂
At the cafeteria.

329
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,690
收银员太性感了
The cashier is smokin'.

330
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:39,360
我可能愣了会神
I might have been distracted for a little while.

331
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,650
好的
Okay.

332
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:42,360
谢谢
Thanks.

333
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:47,930

水
Water.

总是有更多的水
Always more water.

352

甚至更多
Even more.

353
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,260
我知道  很可怕
I know. It's scary.

354
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,500
你和孩子们处得很好
You are good with children.

355
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,140
你当爸爸了吗
You are father?

356
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:50,850
没有
No.

357
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,710
希望以后会
One day, I hope.

358
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,290
叫快速反应小组过来  快
Page rapid response team, STAT.

359
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,340
药物应该能改善心律不齐  而不是恶化症状
The meds should've improved his arrhythmia, not made it worse.

360
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,150
也许除了其他症状
Maybe in addition to his other problems,

361
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,490
他还患有心内膜炎
he's developed endocarditis?

362
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:28,090
超声检查显示他的瓣膜和心内膜并没有
His echo didn't reveal vegetations on his valves or...

363
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,850
赘肉瘤
endocardium.

364
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,720
他没有发烧
He has not developed a fever.

365
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,250
还是小心为好  做个血培养
Let's be sure. Get blood cultures.

366
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,670
两次  十五分钟
Order them times two, 15 minutes.

367
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:37,000
放错地方了
It's in the wrong place.

368
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:45,210
放错地方了
It was in the wrong place.

369
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:46,780
好吧
Okay.

370
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,670
两次  隔十五分钟测一次
Times two. 15 minutes apart.

371
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,450
伦纳德说他过来看你了
Leonard says that he stops by here to see you.

372
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:04,760
是的
Yeah.

373
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,000
他假装要路过食堂
He pretends the cafeteria is on his route.

374
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,560
好像我不知道化验室在哪似的
Like I don't know where the lab is.

375
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,180
昨天三点左右  格温
Yesterday around 3:00, Gwen.

376
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,600
注意到有哪个食物托盘里面放的不是吃的吗
Notice anything on the food trays that wasn't food?

377
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:14,400
三点左右
Around 3:00?

378
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:16,010
和往常一样
Just the usual --

379
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:20,600
特百惠杯子  太阳眼镜  手机  一个避孕套
Tupperware, sunglasses, cellphones, a condom.

380
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,340
四点左右  我找到了个玻璃假眼
Around 4:00, I found a glass eye.

381
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,290
你有看到一个生物危害袋吗
You see a biohazard bag?

382
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:27,420
上面有红圈的自封袋吗
The ziplock bag with the red circles?

383
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,130
是的
Yeah.

384
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,370
跟我来
C'mon.

385
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,880
你可以动二尖瓣
You can move the mitral valve.

386
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:39,040
谢谢你的直观教具
Thanks for the visual aid.

387
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:40,820
你不能动二尖瓣
You can't move the mitral valve.

388
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,700
如果土豆先生有个房间隔的鼻子
Now, if Mr. Potato Head had an atrial septal nose

389
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,720
-和肥大性阻塞性心肌  -我相信
- and hypertrophic obstructive -- - I believe --

390
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,810
-我相信二尖瓣附着异常可以... -停
- I believe the abnormal insertion of the mitral valve can be -- - Stop.

391
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:52,690
跟我来
Follow me.

392
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:58,770
我很确定昨天我在这里看到个生物危害袋
Pretty sure I saw a biohazard bag in here yesterday.

393
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:00,290
你们很幸运现在过来找
You're lucky you came when you did.

394
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,970
因为两个小时后这些就会被倒掉
It's due to get dumped in two hours.

395
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,230
假牙  那最恶心了
Dentures. They're the worst.

396
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:08,810
每个病人都有一个标有名字的假牙杯
You know, every patient gets a denture cup with their name on it.

397
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:11,190
所以为什么他们的假牙从来都不放到杯子里
So, tell me, why are the dentures never in the cup?

398
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,030
就算放了  也是放错了杯子
And if they are, it's the wrong cup?

399
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,020
真是一大谜案
One of life's mysteries.

400
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:17,240
看到生物危害袋了
Biohazard bag sighting.

401
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,150
用生物危害袋当零钱袋
A biohazard bag for a coin purse?

402
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:22,090
认真的吗
Really?

403
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,470
最后  室间隔肌切开术
Finally, a septal myectomy

404
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:27,910
可以切开流出道
will open the outflow tract,

405
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,610
二尖瓣就可以被植入到
and the mitral valve can be re-implanted

406
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:31,530
一个更加正常的位置
into a more normal position.

407
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,730
谢谢  这是我的想法
Thank you. That's my idea.

408
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:35,830
你能在加布里尔身上做这个手术吗
Can you do this procedure on Gabriel?

409
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,580
不能
No.

410
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,710
这个主意很糟糕  没有用的
It's a terrible idea, and it won't work.

411
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:42,280
所以这是在演哪出
So, what was the point of this dog and pony show?

412
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:44,780
因为看起来你很热衷于替我做医学决定
'Cause you seemed keen on making medical decisions for me.

413
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,250
所以只是反抗而已
So just insubordination?

414
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,760
反正我们最后还是得来找你
And we were probably gonna wind up coming to you anyway.

415
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:51,370
一旦莫菲医生有一个想法  他都会坚持己见
Once Dr. Murphy gets an idea, he stays with it,

416
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:53,110
无论别人说什么
regardless of what anyone says.

417
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:54,750
是可以的
This can work.

418
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,870
是的  是可以的
Yes, this can work.

419
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:00,060
如果那孩子能活两小时  那真是个好主意
And it would be a great idea if the boy had two hours to live.

420
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,690
害怕失败是不这么做的一个好理由吗
Is fear of failure a good reason not to do this?

421
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:06,740
不
No.

422
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:08,950
但你知道什么是吗
But you know what is?

423
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,840
他本可以多活几年的想法...
The thought that he might have a few more birthdays...

424
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,120
或是交一个最好的朋友
or make a best friend.

425
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:18,720
我不知道  我不能让他死
I don't know. I'm not sending him home in a box.

426
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:23,200
我们得走了
We got to go.

427
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:25,140
加布里尔的心律不齐  越来越严重了
Gabriel's arrhythmia, it's gotten worse.

428
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,690
你还没找到
You still haven't found it?

429
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:29,870
我可以让普莱斯顿小姐来回答所有问题
I can get Ms. Preston to address any questions --

430
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:31,860
她没有参加手术  你参加了
She wasn't in the surgery. You were.

431
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:35,240
她负责所有的医疗事故
She is the point person for all therapeutic misadventures.

432
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,510
你在逗我吗
Are you kidding me?

433
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:40,940
我可能会毫无理由失声
I may lose my voice for absolutely no reason,

434
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,610
你却在用什么术语搪塞我
and you are using canned jargon.

435
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:45,140
样杯里的不是牙膏
That sample cup doesn't have toothpaste

436
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:47,140
袜子或者防晒霜  好吗
or socks or sunblock in it, okay?

437
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,230
是我的命啊
It has my life!

438
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,390
对不起
I'm sorry.

439
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:58,080
谢谢
Thank you.

440
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,560
-干得漂亮  -是啊
- Good for you. - Yeah, right.

441
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,000
-我刚刚违反了大概八条规定  -也许吧
- I just broke about eight rules. - Maybe.

442
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,010
我不会告诉「普莱斯顿小姐」的
"Ms. Preston" won't hear about it from me.

443
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:15,970
不过你应该把样本找到
You should go find that sample, though.

444
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:18,300
谢了
Thanks.

445
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:24,660
药不起作用  为什么
The meds aren't working. The question is why.

446
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:29,690
也许心律不齐只是
M-Maybe the arrhythmia is just another manifestation

447
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:31,150
加布里尔机能障碍的另一个表现
of Gabriel's L.V. Dysfunction.

448
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:34,480
我们至少还应该把这看成他异位的下降
We should still be seeing at least a modest decline in his ectopy.

449
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,970
也许他的梯度变化曲线不太好
Maybe his gradient is worse.

450
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,670
我们可以试试钙通道阻滞剂
We could try calcium channel blockers.

451
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,390
还有个更简单的解释
There's a much simpler explanation.

452
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,120
关于他的心内膜炎有个好消息
Good news about his endocarditis --

453
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,170
心脏炎症
heart inflammation.

454
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:52,450
他的检查很正常
His tests are normal.

455
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,700
但是我们还是很担心
But we still are concerned.

456
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,800
出于某种原因  他的药没起作用
For some reason, his medication isn't helping.

457
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,340
最好的解释就是...
Our best explanation is...

458
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:03,260
他没有吃药
he hasn't been taking his medication.

459
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,670
我是想救他的命
I am trying to save his life.

460
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,860
通过不给他吃药吗
But withholding his medicine?

461
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:22,500
通过把他留在这
By keeping him here.

462
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,170
如果他吃了药  变好了
If he takes the medicine and becomes better,

463
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:27,190
你是在送他去死
you send him to die.

464
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:29,540
但是我们只能做到这了
But there is nothing else that we can do for him here.

465
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:33,390
你不知道我生活的地方  那是什么样子
You do not understand where I live, what it is like.

466
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,310
我不了解你的村子
I don't know your village.

467
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:39,900
但是我知道穷是什么样的
But I do know what it's like to be poor.

468
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,860
我小时候家里很穷
I grew up with nothing.

469
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,450
我妹是残废
My sister was disabled.

470
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:46,970
我父母负担不起她的药物和治疗
My parents couldn't afford her meds or treatments.

471
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:48,090
看着她痛苦
And it killed them,

472
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,380
简直要了我父母和我的命
and me, to watch her suffer.

473
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:56,210
但是当没有办法的时候  真的是无能为力了
But when nothing can be done, nothing can be done.

474
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,480
你成为了一名医生
You became a doctor?

475
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:03,350
你没有安于贫穷
You did not accept being poor.

476
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:05,980
不
No.

477
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,020
那你一点都不了解
Then you do not understand at all.

478
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,380
我们什么都没有  食物
We want for everything -- food.

479
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:19,460
和平  药
Peace. Medicine.

480
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:24,810
但是我们最想要的是希望
But our greatest want is hope.

481
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,020
如果我们离开了  就没有希望了
If we leave here, we leave hope behind.

482
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:39,790
好吧
Okay.

483
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:41,550
我会尽力的
I'll do what I can.

484
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:48,670
我来看一下伊丽莎白
I dropped by to see Elizabeth.

485
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,560
毫不奇怪  她很沮丧
Not surprisingly, she's very upset.

486
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,630
我也不知道怎么安慰她
There wasn't much I could offer in the way of comfort.

487
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:54,270
要是人们都能各司其职就好了
If only people did their jobs.

488
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:55,520
什么人
Which people?

489
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:59,390
护士  送检员  化验室技术人员
Scrub nurses, couriers, lab techs...

490
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:01,500
这真是个奇怪的清单
That's a curiously limited list.

491
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:02,690
我的手术过程没有出错
I did the surgery correctly.

492
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:03,820
同样  我不认为要求别人做好自己的
I don't think it's too much to expect others

493
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,770
本职工作是一件过分的事情
to do their jobs correctly, as well.

494
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,680
所以  不是你的错  你没有问题
So, not your fault, not your problem.

495
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,500
你想做什么  让我觉得内疚吗
What are you trying to do, make me feel guilty?

496
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,020
是的  我希望你感觉很糟糕
Yes. I want you to feel horrible.

497
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:13,480
那是唯一会让你改变的事情
That's the only thing that's gonna make you change.

498
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,430
-变成什么  -我嫁的那个人
- Into what? - The guy I married.

499
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:18,580
那个关心病人大过于关心政治斗争的人
The guy who cared more about patients than politics.

500
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,980
我懂了
Okay, I get it.

501
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:22,780
你说的是我竞争医院院长的事情
This is about me vying for president of the hospital.

502
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:24,390
我们已经详细讨论过了
Which we discussed at length,

503
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:27,230
你也说你会百分之百支持我
which you said you were 100% behind me on.

504
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:28,980
我没意识到我落后你多远了
I didn't realize how far behind.

505
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:30,780
你认为我把你抛在身后了吗
You think I've left you behind?

506
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,130
周二
Tuesday --

507
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:38,010
「资本输出会议延迟了  我会晚到」
"Capital expenditures meeting delayed. Will be late."

508
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:40,970
周三  「募捐活动预演  别等我了」
Wednesday, "Fundraising event ran over. Don't wait up."

509
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,890
-周四  -伊兹  关于我的工作
- Thursday -- - Iz, there are things about my job --

510
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:43,800
没错
Right.

511
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,430
「不是你的错」
"Not your fault."

512
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,560
病理学

513
00:23:58,690 --> 00:23:59,640
你好
Hello.

514
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:04,910
你知道福尔马林的样本都被送到同一个地方吗
Did you know that specimens in formalin go to one place,

515
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,870
除了其他地方的样本
exempt specimens somewhere else,

516
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:09,740
好氧和厌氧在不同的地方培养
aerobic and anaerobic cultures two different places?

517
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,950
放射性的  医疗设备
radioactive, medical device,

518
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,920
法医标本  都在不同地方
forensic specimens -- all different?

519
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,360
并且都被不同的员工处理
And all handled by different staff?

520
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,480
你知道吗
Did you know that?

521
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:18,320
知道
Yes.

522
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,430
我也做了一个表
I made a chart, too.

523
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:24,700
把你教我的东西做了一个定性观察日志
A qualitative observation log of what you taught me.

524
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:25,820
我教你的什么
What did I teach you?

525
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,770
调情
Flirting.

526
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,610
每次见到有人调情  我都记录下来
Every time I saw someone flirt, I noted it

527
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:33,620
然后对主客体以及非言语手势进行交叉对照
and cross-referenced the subject, object, and nonverbal gestures.

528
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,280
我就知道
I knew it.

529
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,790
收银的格温
Gwen, the cashier.

530
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,670
她声称都是送检员主动的  但
She made out that it was all the courier, but --

531
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:41,220
那是我的名字
That's my name.

532
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,760
是的  你也做了撩骚动作
Yes. You made flirting gestures.

533
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,480
-不  我没有  -你有
- No, I didn't. - Yes, you did.

534
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,120
你把头发往后撩了
You brushed your hair back.

535
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:50,460
用右手  单边撩
Right hand, side sweeping.

536
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:53,520
对梅伦德斯医生
At Dr. Melendez?

537
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,360
不  我不这么认为  肖恩
No, I don't think so. Shaun.

538
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:58,080
-我没有  -你有
- No. - Yes.

539
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,640
你在护士站
You were at the nurses station,

540
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,540
然后他说  「干得漂亮」
and he said, "Good for you,"

541
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:04,170
然后你说「是啊  我刚刚违反了大概八条规定」
and you said, "Yeright. I just broke about eight rules,"

542
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,750
然后你咯咯笑了  接着把头发往后撩
and smiled and giggled and brushed your hair back.

543
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,270
我不会告诉「普莱斯顿小姐」的
"Ms. Preston" Won't hear about it from me.

544
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,300
也可能你得了皮癣
It's possible you have ringworm.

545
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,320
肖恩  有时候人们撩头发
Shaun, sometimes people toss their hair

546
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:24,170
只是因为头发挡住脸了
just 'cause it's in their face.

547
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,130
莫菲
Murphy.

548
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:27,580
我想让你详细说明一下你的想法
I'd like you to elaborate on your idea.

549
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:29,470
我糟糕的想法
My terrible idea?

550
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,570
就是那个
That's the one.

551
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:47,800
你可以移动瓣膜的前叶  然后重新接上
You can move the anterior leaflet of the valve and reattach it.

552
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:49,960
不  我们不能
No, we can't.

553
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:52,820
这是那个孩子心脏的精准复制
This is an exact replica of the kid's heart,

554
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,460
没有固定点可以用来重新接上
and there's no anchor point to reattach it.

555
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,990
所以你的那部分想法还是很糟糕
So that part of your idea is still terrible.

556
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:58,960
好吧
Okay.

557
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:02,120
但是剩下的呢
But the rest of it?

558
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,840
我们在处理一个巨大的隔膜
We're dealing with a huge septum --

559
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,130
有25毫米
25 millimeters.

560
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,790
对一个健康的孩子来说是多大
What would that number be in a healthy kid?

561
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:07,870
大约8毫米
About 8.

562
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:09,680
如果我们想接近8毫米
If we go anywhere near that number,

563
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,130
对瓣膜来说就没有足够的支撑
we won't have enough support for the valve.

564
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:19,180
但是如果说我们减小到20毫米
But let's say we took that down to 20...

565
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:22,520
那对于减轻出口梗阻来说就会不够了
That won't be enough to relieve the outflow obstruction.

566
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:26,610
好吧
Okay.

567
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:28,470
18毫米
18.

568
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,060
好
Okay.

569
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,580
仪器

570
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,000
我们岔开他的旁路
Let's take him off bypass.

571
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,220
旁路

572
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:40,540
他死了
He's dead.

573
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:42,340
再来一次  16毫米
Again. 16.

574
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:44,850
我真的好累
I'm really tired.

575
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:48,430
我曾经想过
I used to think that

576
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:51,750
我要成为史上最好的外科医生
I wanted to be the best surgeon in history.

577
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:53,110
但我新的目标
But my new goal?

578
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:57,030
只是希望不要在实习期就被刷掉
Is just not to get washed out of my residency.

579
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:01,360
你现在有手术吗
You have a surgery now?

580
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:03,300
没有
No.

581
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,950
我来看看有什么需要帮忙的
I'm here to see how I can help.

582
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:07,490
外科主任来参加搜寻派对
The Chief of Surgery joining the search party?

583
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:08,510
我是不是应该来个自拍
Should I take a selfie,

584
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:10,630
给我的朋友们看看发生了什么
show my friends that this really happened?

585
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:11,870
这是团队的问题
This is a team problem.

586
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:13,200
所以应该团队一起解决
It should be a team solution.

587
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,200
你是怎么有这么好的领导的
How do you get a boss like this?

588
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,400
现在我们知道什么
What do we know so far?

589
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:25,120
我们岔开他的旁路
Let's take him off bypass.

590
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:39,640
血液流出量在13毫米的时候很完美
His outflow is perfect at 13 millimeters.

591
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:42,490
但当左房室瓣没有足够的支撑
Which is irrelevant when the mitral valve...

592
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:44,560
去关闭时  这无关紧要
...doesn't have enough support to close.

593
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:46,560
他死了
He's dead.

594
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,680
再一次
Again.

595
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:52,330
布朗医生
Dr. Browne.

596
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:56,180
关于你代表医院承担责任并告诉伊丽莎白你很抱歉
Any reason you assumed responsibility on behalf of the hospital...

597
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,400
这件事有什么解释吗
told Elizabeth you were "Sorry"?

598
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:01,890
因为我确实抱歉
Because I was.

599
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:08,730
希望这样做不会付出什么代价
Well, I hope we don't see the price tag on that.

600
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:13,080
并且你没有时间了
And I think you're out of time.

601
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:22,990
我们岔开他的旁路
Let's take him off bypass.

602
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,380
旁路

603
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,150
成功了
Yes.

604
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:40,690
14毫米
14 millimeters.

605
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:42,660
精确的
Exactly.

606
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:44,220
是的
Yeah.

607
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:45,600
精确
Exactly.

608
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:52,110
我们的误差幅度极低
Our margin of error is exceedingly low.

609
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,340
运气好
Good luck.

610
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,300
你相信运气吗
You believe in luck?

611
00:29:56,390 --> 00:30:00,290
这是人们在很困难的情况下会说的
It's something people say in difficult situations.

612
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:03,970
我也不信
Neither do I.

613
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:05,530
再来一次
Again.

614
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:10,460
事实是  即使我们现在找到了你的样品
The reality is, even if we found your specimen now,

615
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,310
很可能已经没有活性了
it's unlikely that it'd still be viable.

616
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:19,200
你不知道我是否得了癌症
You don't know if I have cancer,

617
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:22,280
也没有办法能知道
and there's no way to find out.

618
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:29,430
所以我的选择就是去做我可能不需要做的手术
So my choices are surgery I may not need...

619
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:33,310
可能会让我无法说话
...that will leave me without speech,

620
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:37,160
或者什么都不做  然后可能死去
or I do nothing and maybe die.

621
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:40,200
很不幸  是的
Unfortunately, yes.

622
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:58,660
BGM: Ancient Light by Allman Brown

623
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:57,980
? That ancient light, weigh ?

624
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:04,950
? On your shoulders ?

625
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:09,910
? And the river of time ?

626
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:15,870
? Love is all that's left to lose ?

627
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:22,270
? Love is all that's left to lose ?

628
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:41,110
? Lust, love ?

629
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:44,830
? I'm not alone anymore ?

630
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:48,130
? Lust, love ?

631
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,760
? I'm not alone anymore ?

632
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:59,510
? This ancient life ?

633
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:06,260
? This ancient life ?

634
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:03,960
刀
Knife.

635
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,480
三小时三十分钟
3 hours, 30 minutes.

636
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,250
我们得把搭桥时间控制在五个小时以内
You didn't want him on bypass any longer than five hours.

637
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:32,400
诗歌集

638
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:32,990
维肯和布林肯是两只小眼睛
"Wynken and Blynken are two little eyes,

639
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,260
诺德是一颗小脑袋
and Nod is a little head,

640
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:39,330
驶向天空的这只木鞋子
and the wooden shoe that sailed the skies

641
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:41,330
是一个小不点的小矮床
is a wee one's trundle-bed.

642
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:47,160
所以闭上眼睛吧  当妈妈唱着
So shut your eyes while Mother sings --

643
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,230
看起来如何  莫菲医生
How's it look, Dr. Murphy?

644
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:58,170
14毫米
14 millimeters.

645
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:59,480
正好
Exactly.

646
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,100
很完美
Perfect.

647
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:06,070
他的隔膜组织
His septal tissue...

648
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:13,960
比预期还要僵硬
It's stiffer than I anticipated.

649
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:24,400
我想没法支撑到充足的外流结束
I don't think this is gonna be enough for adequate outflow.

650
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,520
我要把隔膜降到13毫米
I'm taking the septum down to 13.

651
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:35,790
好  瓣膜在13毫米时没撑住
Okay, the valve wasn't supported at 13.

652
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:36,970
病患死了
The patient died.

653
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:39,050
那是模拟  不是真的病患
That was a model, not a patient.

654
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:41,630
我们已经用了五小时三分钟
We're at five hours and three minutes.

655
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:49,250
降到13毫米
We're taking him down to 13.

656
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:56,970
执行
Field.

657
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,080
大家先听我说
All quiet for the time-out.

658
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:03,870
病患叫伊丽莎白·迈凯伦
Patient is Elizabeth McLaren.

659
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,990
无已知过敏史
No known allergies.

660
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:07,180
我们要用U形切口
We'll be doing a total laryngectomy

661
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,870
做全喉切除术
with a Gluck Sorenson U-shaped incision.

662
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:10,230
大家都同意吗
Is everyone in agreement?

663
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,010
打抗生素了吗
Antibiotics in?

664
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:14,780
已输了一克的氨中噻肟头孢菌素
One gram of cefotaxime has been infused.

665
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:16,160
在等样本
We anticipate a specimen.

666
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,910
已要求打印标签
I've requested labels be printed.

667
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,080
笔
Pen.

668
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,270
准备插管
Prepare to intubate.

669
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,070
假牙
Dentures.

670
00:34:26,410 --> 00:34:28,030
先别动手术
You've gotta hold the surgery.

671
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:30,630
稍等我一下
Just give me a little time.

672
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:37,350
已经13毫米了
That's 13.

673
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:44,970
该死
Dammit.

674
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,340
太薄了
Too thin?

675
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:52,230
瓣膜没足够的支撑
The valve doesn't have adequate support.

676
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:54,360
不能缝合
It won't be able to close.

677
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,210
我错了
I was wrong.

678
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,960
这有复位点
There's a reattachment point.

679
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,670
在14毫米时没看到
We must not have seen it at 14

680
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:22,430
肯定是因为被瓣膜下的组织遮住了
'cause it was obscured by the subvalvular tissue.

681
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:25,570
可以以此为锚点  移动瓣膜
We can use that as an anchor point and move the valve.

682
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,620
你的疯狂点子这下好多了
Your terrible idea just got a hell of a lot better.

683
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:29,530
缝合
Stitch.

684
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:31,480
5小时23分钟
5 hours, 23 minutes.

685
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,380
假牙
Dentures.

686
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,650
总会装错杯子
They always end up in the wrong cup,

687
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:52,950
所以才很难交到主人手上
which is why they're so hard to get back to the owner.

688
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:54,020
-对吧  -对
- Okay. - Right.

689
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:56,200
要是样本上的标签错了呢
What if the label on the specimen was wrong?

690
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,230
如果结节装到容器里
What -- what if the nodule is here,

691
00:35:58,250 --> 00:35:59,900
但容器的标签贴错了呢
but the container has the wrong name on it?

692
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,880
好  我把操作记录
Okay, I'm reconciling the operative records

693
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,810
还有手术安排和样本做比对
to the surgery schedule to the specimen.

694
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:05,590
我去看看病例  检查一下容器
I'll read the cases, check the containers,

695
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:07,120
现在说你的话就太混蛋了
and feel like a jerk for judging you.

696
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,340
我要是对的  你才是混蛋
Well, you're only a jerk if I'm right.

697
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:13,150
泵送时间
Pump time?

698
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,950
6小时48分
6 hours, 48 minutes.

699
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:22,480
叫梅达进来
Get Mehta in here.

700
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:25,800
切断他的体外循环
Let's take him off bypass.

701
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,000
12秒
12 seconds.

702
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,090
要去拿电极板吗
Should I get the paddles?

703
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:58,200
等等
Not yet.

704
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,900
加油啊  加布里尔
Come on, Gabriel.

705
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,770
他体外循环多久了
How long has he been on bypass?

706
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:04,470
几乎超时两小时  得助推启动...
Nearly two hours too long. We need to jump-start --

707
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:05,550
等等
Not yet!

708
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:15,850
好
Yeah.

709
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:17,340
太好了
Yes!

710
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:25,090
莫菲医生  缝合吧
Dr. Murphy, close him up.

711
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:34,480
BGM: Sons And Daughters by Allman Brown (feat. Liz Lawrence)

712
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:32,830
? And I will hold you tight ?

713
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:38,340
? Like the moon in the arms of the sky ?

714
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:46,050
? And I will keep you warm ?

715
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:51,780
? I will build a fire in this house ?

716
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:49,370
他的自主心跳很正常
It's beating just fine on its own.

717
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:54,310
? And I'll build a fire ?

718
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:55,980
? You fetch the water ?

719
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,810
? And I'll lay the table ?

720
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:00,840
? And in our hearts ?

721
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:04,490
? We still pray for sons and daughters ?

722
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,880
马库斯
Marcus.

723
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,940
? And all those evenings out in the garden ?

724
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:11,330
? The red, red wine ?

725
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:18,010
? These quiet hours turning to years ?

726
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:21,640
在你手术前手术室有个样本杯
There was a specimen cup in the O.R. prior to your surgery.

727
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,990
原本是取子弹时要用的
It was supposed to be used for a bullet removal,

728
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,650
结果子弹留在了体内
but they left the bullet in the body,

729
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:30,640
然后杯子不小心用来装你的样本了
and the cup was used accidentally for your specimen.

730
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,680
不仅把样本泡在了福尔马林里
Not only was it in formalin,

731
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:35,590
还被冷冻起来  十分鲜活
but it was refrigerated and fresh as a daisy.

732
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:38,980
伊丽莎白  你没得癌症
Elizabeth, you don't have cancer.

733
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,140
谢谢
Thank you.

734
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:51,200
医生
Doctor.

735
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,410
? And I'll build a fire ?

736
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:56,000
? You fetch the water ?

737
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,880
? And I'll lay the table ?

738
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,810
? And in our hearts ?

739
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:04,470
? We still pray for sons and daughters ?

740
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:09,020
? And all those evenings out in the garden ?

741
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:09,440
不可捉摸
Intangibles.

742
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:11,210
? The red, red wine ?

743
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:19,350
? These quiet hours turning to years ?

744
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,420
你好
Hello.

745
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:21,390
你好
Hello.

746
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:23,190
我今天过得很不错
I had a very good day today.

747
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:24,060
是啊  没错
Yes, you did.

748
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,410
手术太精彩
That was a hell of an operation.

749
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:26,320
对
Yes.

750
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,390
我还看到克莱尔撩骚
And I caught Claire flirting.

751
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:29,410
撩你吗
With you?

752
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:30,490
肖恩  我想你可能误...
Shaun, I think you might be mis--

753
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:31,980
撩梅伦德斯医生
With Dr. Melendez.

754
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,500
梅伦德斯医生
Dr. Melendez.

755
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,020
我进行了观察
I conducted observations,

756
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:37,400
读懂了  然后记录了下来
successfully interpreted them, and logged them.

757
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,830
电子表上的浪漫
Romance in a spreadsheet.

758
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:40,910
我喜欢
I love it.

759
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:45,020
克莱尔没读懂的暗示我却读懂了
I was aware of the cues even when Claire wasn't.

760
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,540
我想她需要生活技能指导
I think she needs a life-skills coach.

761
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:49,030
推断
Extrapolating.

762
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:50,050
我也喜欢
I like that, too.

763
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:51,030
很好  肖恩
That's great, Shaun.

764
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,190
你在观察周围  在学习
You're paying attention. You're learning.

765
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:57,500
等给你找到懂时尚的生活指导
And when we find you a life coach, one with a fashion sense,

766
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,020
你就能学得更好
then you're gonna be learning better,

767
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:00,740
你会学得更快
you're gonna be learning faster.

768
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:05,950
你要放弃我了吗
Are you giving up on me?

769
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:08,300
什么
What?

770
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:10,980
不  我没有放弃你
No. I haven't given up on you.

771
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:13,480
我不要陌生人帮我
I don't want a stranger helping me.

772
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:17,540
我知道  肖恩  但...
I know, Shaun. But...

773
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:21,080
我不能...
And I can't...

774
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:24,510
我不能一直陪伴你  我...
I can't always be there. I-I..

775
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:27,820
我不能一直给予你你需要的帮助
I can't always help you the way you need to be helped,

776
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,870
你应该得到的帮助
the way you deserve to be helped.

777
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:32,270
我不要陌生人帮我
I don't want a stranger helping me.

778
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:46,780
恭喜
Congratulations.

779
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,310
你也是
You too.

780
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:50,510
你疯狂的侦探技术
On your mad sleuthing skills.

781
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:53,490
如果对外科腻烦了  还有这个退路
Something to fall back on if this surgery thing gets old.

782
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:57,250
你做得很棒  克莱尔
You did a nice job, Claire.

783
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:59,740
-谢谢  -这是我们的代价
- Thanks. - And here is our price tag.

784
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:01,100
我们收到传票了
We've been served.

785
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:03,790
但我们找到了  伊丽莎白没事
But we found it. Elizabeth's fine.

786
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:04,720
我知道
I know.

787
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,540
但我们让她痛苦了两天
But we put her through two days of hell,

788
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:08,830
她想确保别人不会有这种遭遇
and she wants to make sure it doesn't happen to anybody else.

789
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:09,890
她干得好
I mean, good for her.

790
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,770
这是什么
What is this?

791
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:17,420
加布里尔的起搏器
Gabriel's pacemaker.

792
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:19,380
我听说你今天又发光了
I heard you were brilliant again today.

793
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:22,780
我运气好
I got lucky.

794
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:30,800
如果我养刺猬做宠物  楼管会杀了我吗
Do you think Armen would kill me if I got a pet hedgehog?

795
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:32,030
我看书写它们其实挺...
I mean, I read that they're actually pretty --

796
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:33,800
-莉亚  -怎么了  肖恩
- Lea. - Yes, Shaun?

797
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:38,040
这毛衣不太适合你
You look absurd in that sweater.

798
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:46,110
我有苹果
I have apples.

799
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:48,440
你要吃苹果吗
Do you want an apple?

800
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:52,630
好
Yeah.
