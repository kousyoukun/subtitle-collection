1
00:01:56,436 --> 00:01:58,937
You won't believe the crap
Armen pulled last night.

2
00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:00,605
He cut the power to my apartment!

3
00:02:00,607 --> 00:02:01,673
That's right!

4
00:02:01,675 --> 00:02:04,842
No lights, no Wi-Fi, nothing.

5
00:02:04,844 --> 00:02:06,511
For 15 minutes!

6
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,148
- Mm...
- And if I had been on a ventilator,

7
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:12,383
I could've suffocated
in that time, right?

8
00:02:12,385 --> 00:02:13,384
You're a doctor.

9
00:02:13,386 --> 00:02:15,162
You're not on a ventilator.

10
00:02:15,164 --> 00:02:17,755
Thank God for that. But I could be.

11
00:02:17,757 --> 00:02:20,091
I mean, it was dark. I could've tripped.

12
00:02:20,093 --> 00:02:21,759
I should sue him.

13
00:02:23,128 --> 00:02:24,762
Sorry.

14
00:02:24,764 --> 00:02:27,098
Were you gonna eat this? I stress eat.

15
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,233
Okay, listen.

16
00:02:28,235 --> 00:02:29,402
I go to talk to him,

17
00:02:29,404 --> 00:02:32,170
and he claims I was playing
my music too loud again.

18
00:02:33,406 --> 00:02:36,808
I wear earplugs
when your music irritates me.

19
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,376
I miss the dripping.

20
00:02:39,101 --> 00:02:41,479
You're missing the point here,
Shaun, okay?

21
00:02:41,481 --> 00:02:42,647
You knock. You ask.

22
00:02:42,649 --> 00:02:44,249
You don't cut someone's power.

23
00:02:44,251 --> 00:02:45,816
You knock, right?

24
00:02:46,419 --> 00:02:48,391
Of course, you would knock.
Any normal person would.

25
00:02:48,393 --> 00:02:51,055
I mean, am I crazy
or is he a total sociopath?

26
00:02:51,057 --> 00:02:53,091
You should get headphones.

27
00:02:53,093 --> 00:02:54,659
Headphones?

28
00:02:55,075 --> 00:02:56,728
They would eliminate the sound.

29
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,763
Yeah. I got it.

30
00:02:58,765 --> 00:03:00,031
Thank you.

31
00:03:00,033 --> 00:03:02,533
Thank you for being
so objective about this.

32
00:03:02,535 --> 00:03:04,235
In fact, why don't you go help Armen

33
00:03:04,237 --> 00:03:05,666
write my eviction notice!

34
00:03:23,923 --> 00:03:26,524
Yeah, and I'll never
drive down that street again.

35
00:03:26,526 --> 00:03:28,426
- Whoa.
- It's a pretty bad memory.

36
00:03:28,428 --> 00:03:29,972
Yeah, that sounds pretty...

37
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,800
Wait, it's kind of hot
for a hike, isn't it?

38
00:03:35,802 --> 00:03:37,635
We're hiking.
We're gonna sweat. It happens.

39
00:03:37,637 --> 00:03:38,836
All right, don't do nothing stupid!

40
00:03:38,838 --> 00:03:39,904
Open the register
and put everything in the bag!

41
00:03:39,906 --> 00:03:42,340
Come on! Right now! Hey!

42
00:03:42,342 --> 00:03:43,641
Don't move. Give me your
wallets, phones, everything.

43
00:03:43,643 --> 00:03:45,476
Keep your hands where I can see 'em.

44
00:03:45,478 --> 00:03:47,612
I said get out your wallet!

45
00:03:48,915 --> 00:03:50,615
Do it now!

46
00:03:50,617 --> 00:03:52,550
Wallet, now!

47
00:03:53,553 --> 00:03:55,887
- Is he okay?
- We don't know.

48
00:03:55,889 --> 00:03:57,180
This is routed through Basecamp.

49
00:03:57,181 --> 00:03:58,313
It says Shaun was there,

50
00:03:58,315 --> 00:03:59,548
but it didn't say if he was hurt or not.

51
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:00,949
Well, EMS has two critical inbounding.

52
00:04:00,951 --> 00:04:02,884
Their hands are a little full
to chat right now.

53
00:04:03,887 --> 00:04:05,454
20-year-old female.

54
00:04:05,456 --> 00:04:07,322
Single gunshot wound to the abdomen.

55
00:04:07,324 --> 00:04:08,423
Hypotensive and tachy.

56
00:04:08,425 --> 00:04:09,791
Two liters of saline en route.

57
00:04:09,793 --> 00:04:10,959
Her name's Avery.

58
00:04:10,961 --> 00:04:12,360
We'll take good care of her.

59
00:04:12,362 --> 00:04:13,945
Jared, you're with me.

60
00:04:21,505 --> 00:04:23,305
Blunt-force neck injury.

61
00:04:23,307 --> 00:04:25,307
Oxygen sats just dropped below 80.

62
00:04:25,309 --> 00:04:26,308
Trachea's crushed.

63
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,776
I inserted a laryngeal mask,

64
00:04:27,778 --> 00:04:29,277
but the airway is not secured.

65
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:30,946
Are you okay? You weren't hurt?

66
00:04:30,948 --> 00:04:33,782
His oropharyngeal anatomy
is distorted from the confusion.

67
00:04:33,784 --> 00:04:35,517
Subcutaneous emphysema.
He's barely moving air.

68
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:37,853
Let's take him to a bay,
and get me an O.R. now.

69
00:04:37,855 --> 00:04:39,354
I need four units
O-Negative type and cross her.

70
00:04:39,356 --> 00:04:40,956
She has decreased breath sounds
on her left.

71
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:43,191
Let's get a chest X-ray on her.

72
00:04:45,496 --> 00:04:48,029
What the hell is <i>he</i> doing here?

73
00:04:50,968 --> 00:04:52,000
It's his fault.

74
00:04:54,505 --> 00:04:56,304
This is all his fault!

75
00:05:06,758 --> 00:05:14,832
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

76
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:16,521
Yeah, clerk says the guy entered,

77
00:05:16,522 --> 00:05:17,621
shouted orders,

78
00:05:17,623 --> 00:05:19,596
and apparently,
your doctor didn't comply.

79
00:05:19,598 --> 00:05:20,650
Girl gets shot,

80
00:05:20,652 --> 00:05:22,096
and the store clerk
clocks the gunman with a bat.

81
00:05:22,098 --> 00:05:23,494
- That's all we know.
- All right, what do you need?

82
00:05:23,496 --> 00:05:25,496
I need forensics on the gunman
and the girl.

83
00:05:25,498 --> 00:05:27,352
All right, we'll let you know
what we find out.

84
00:05:28,234 --> 00:05:29,934
Hey, police are gonna want
to talk to you.

85
00:05:29,936 --> 00:05:31,168
After that, you can go home.

86
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:33,004
I should be helping.

87
00:05:33,006 --> 00:05:35,172
- My shift is just starting.
- You were at the shooting.

88
00:05:35,174 --> 00:05:36,340
I don't have time to hold your hand.

89
00:05:36,342 --> 00:05:38,476
I don't like my hand being held.

90
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:39,877
Small-caliber bullets.

91
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:41,245
They ricochet inside.

92
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:44,382
They can cause multiple
and unpredictable injuries.

93
00:05:45,495 --> 00:05:46,984
And what do we need to do about it?

94
00:05:46,986 --> 00:05:48,623
Chest and abdominal X-rays

95
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:49,974
and a Focused Assessment Sonogram.

96
00:05:49,976 --> 00:05:51,022
Three units of O-neg and...

97
00:05:51,024 --> 00:05:53,060
We could use your help
over here, Mr. Melendez!

98
00:05:54,012 --> 00:05:55,022
Are you okay?

99
00:05:55,024 --> 00:05:56,524
Yes, I'm fine.

100
00:05:56,526 --> 00:05:57,692
You're with me.

101
00:05:57,694 --> 00:05:59,160
- Get a gown on him.
- Okay.

102
00:05:59,162 --> 00:06:00,394
Entrance wound is down here.

103
00:06:00,396 --> 00:06:01,929
The bullet fractured the pelvis
on the way in.

104
00:06:01,931 --> 00:06:03,297
All right, let's look for an exit wound.

105
00:06:03,299 --> 00:06:06,200
We're gonna roll her on three.
One, two, three.

106
00:06:06,202 --> 00:06:07,201
All right, got it.

107
00:06:07,203 --> 00:06:08,675
Between the second and third rib.

108
00:06:08,677 --> 00:06:09,820
She's hemorrhaging here, too.

109
00:06:09,822 --> 00:06:12,106
Hey, Murphy, get us the ultrasound
so we can find out what's inside.

110
00:06:12,689 --> 00:06:16,043
Focused Assessment
with sonography and trauma.

111
00:06:29,024 --> 00:06:31,959
No chest contusions
or secondary injuries evident.

112
00:06:31,961 --> 00:06:33,094
Oxygen sat's 70.

113
00:06:33,096 --> 00:06:34,492
I can't squeeze a camera
past this collapse.

114
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:36,597
O.R. 3 is prepped and ready,
but that's it.

115
00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:38,203
We got a full house right now
up in surgery.

116
00:06:38,205 --> 00:06:40,501
- Next show time is 15 minutes out.
- I could use it.

117
00:06:40,503 --> 00:06:43,004
I gotta get this bleeding under control.
What's the status on your guy?

118
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:44,922
Take her up. Take the gunshot.

119
00:06:44,924 --> 00:06:46,094
Hold on.

120
00:06:46,096 --> 00:06:48,109
His airway's so damaged,
I can't even do a tracheotomy.

121
00:06:48,111 --> 00:06:50,011
He's got five minutes
until anoxic brain dead.

122
00:06:50,013 --> 00:06:51,646
Mine's got pressure.
I'll see what I can do here.

123
00:06:52,604 --> 00:06:54,415
You're scrubbing in with me.

124
00:06:57,442 --> 00:06:59,903
Go ahead and feed the tube
under the collapsed trachea.

125
00:07:03,812 --> 00:07:06,117
Starting high flow O2.

126
00:07:12,507 --> 00:07:13,734
And we're good.

127
00:07:14,837 --> 00:07:17,204
Now that our patient
is actually breathing,

128
00:07:17,206 --> 00:07:18,839
we can realign and repair.

129
00:07:18,841 --> 00:07:20,237
Four-O on a driver.

130
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:22,259
Scissors. Sponge stick.

131
00:07:25,247 --> 00:07:27,548
It's a slippery thing letting
your feelings about a patient

132
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:30,351
influence your medical judgment.

133
00:07:30,353 --> 00:07:31,585
I didn't.

134
00:07:31,587 --> 00:07:33,754
I get the instinct... She's a victim.

135
00:07:33,756 --> 00:07:35,356
He's a shooter, a racist.

136
00:07:35,358 --> 00:07:37,325
Often we don't even know we're doing it.

137
00:07:37,327 --> 00:07:39,026
I would never let my personal feelings

138
00:07:39,028 --> 00:07:40,227
impact a patient's care.

139
00:07:40,229 --> 00:07:41,562
She was bleeding out.

140
00:07:41,564 --> 00:07:43,698
And this guy just drew his first
good breath 30 seconds ago.

141
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,999
They were <i>both</i> critical!

142
00:07:45,001 --> 00:07:46,867
He was dying. You were wrong. Own it.

143
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:48,969
You know as well as I do that

144
00:07:48,971 --> 00:07:50,237
that was not an easy call to make.

145
00:07:50,239 --> 00:07:51,472
- Do I?
- Yes!

146
00:07:57,356 --> 00:07:58,523
Clear the field, Dr. Browne.

147
00:07:59,882 --> 00:08:01,882
Not my <i>operative</i> field.

148
00:08:01,884 --> 00:08:03,284
The <i>surgical</i> field. Scrub out.

149
00:08:03,286 --> 00:08:04,452
Excuse me?

150
00:08:05,335 --> 00:08:06,400
You're done.

151
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:07,655
Step out of my O.R.

152
00:08:08,513 --> 00:08:10,758
Gail, can you please relieve
Dr. Browne of her instruments

153
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,960
and page Dr. Cleland to assist me?

154
00:08:26,036 --> 00:08:28,252
Now, isn't this more pleasant?

155
00:08:28,253 --> 00:08:29,919
Aside from the spleen,
what else are we dealing with?

156
00:08:29,921 --> 00:08:31,755
The bullet ruptured her transverse colon

157
00:08:31,757 --> 00:08:32,956
at the splenic flexure.

158
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,357
Put it on our to-do list.

159
00:08:36,629 --> 00:08:39,085
Why does her boyfriend think
it's your fault?

160
00:08:40,213 --> 00:08:42,232
It punctured her diaphragm here

161
00:08:42,234 --> 00:08:44,758
and entered the posterior chest.

162
00:08:47,672 --> 00:08:48,772
She's bleeding again. Clamp the hilum.

163
00:08:48,774 --> 00:08:50,673
I already did. It's too damaged to hold.

164
00:08:50,713 --> 00:08:52,108
Gauze!

165
00:08:55,113 --> 00:08:56,679
Hold this right there. Don't let go.

166
00:08:58,338 --> 00:08:59,429
Oh, this isn't gonna work.

167
00:08:59,431 --> 00:09:01,117
It's gonna be like sewing
ground beef back into a steak.

168
00:09:01,119 --> 00:09:03,042
All right, new plan... she's gonna
have to live without her spleen.

169
00:09:03,044 --> 00:09:04,102
Nurse to pick up.

170
00:09:05,657 --> 00:09:07,924
Need a ligating suture
on the splenic artery

171
00:09:07,926 --> 00:09:09,225
while I make the cut.

172
00:09:09,227 --> 00:09:10,527
Can you do that for me

173
00:09:10,529 --> 00:09:12,382
before this young lady
bleeds out on us, Murphy?

174
00:09:12,842 --> 00:09:14,007
Yes.

175
00:10:08,133 --> 00:10:10,135
Okay, let's move on to the bowel perf.

176
00:10:17,538 --> 00:10:19,262
Shaun.

177
00:10:19,264 --> 00:10:21,064
Ah, thank God you're all right.

178
00:10:21,066 --> 00:10:23,177
I just heard what happened.

179
00:10:25,036 --> 00:10:28,171
Shaun. Are you all right?

180
00:10:30,071 --> 00:10:32,108
Yes. I wasn't injured.

181
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:34,277
What happened this morning?

182
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:36,097
Lea ate my apple.

183
00:10:36,099 --> 00:10:37,780
No, Shaun, at the store this morning.

184
00:10:37,782 --> 00:10:40,707
What happened at the store?

185
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,866
Wallet now!

186
00:10:43,868 --> 00:10:45,091
I can't.

187
00:10:45,093 --> 00:10:46,122
Why the hell not?!

188
00:10:47,592 --> 00:10:49,924
You said keep my hands
where you could see them.

189
00:10:50,561 --> 00:10:52,929
My wallet is in my pocket.

190
00:10:52,931 --> 00:10:55,198
- You can't see my hands if...
- Are you trying to be a hero?!

191
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,033
- I'm a surgical resident...
- Huh?! Hey!

192
00:10:57,035 --> 00:10:58,480
- Hey!
- Shut the hell up!

193
00:10:58,482 --> 00:10:59,533
This isn't a game, man.

194
00:10:59,535 --> 00:11:00,603
- I'm serious.
- Okay.

195
00:11:00,605 --> 00:11:02,972
Put your damn phone and wallet
on the ground right now.

196
00:11:02,974 --> 00:11:05,008
Hey, do you see this, man?
I am not playing around!

197
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:07,343
Just put your phone and wallet
on the damn ground!

198
00:11:07,345 --> 00:11:09,454
Come on, man, just...
just do what he says!

199
00:11:09,456 --> 00:11:10,639
Please listen to him.

200
00:11:10,641 --> 00:11:12,669
Shut up! Just shut up
and get on your knees!

201
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:14,275
Put your hands and knees on the ground.

202
00:11:14,277 --> 00:11:15,852
Get your wallet out right now. Hey!

203
00:11:15,854 --> 00:11:18,087
I will shoot your crazy
ass, I swear to God. Okay.

204
00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:19,789
- Are you listening to me?! I'll do it!
- Yes.

205
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:21,524
Hey! You hear me?

206
00:11:21,526 --> 00:11:22,992
Hey!

207
00:11:31,803 --> 00:11:32,969
Oh, my God!

208
00:11:45,248 --> 00:11:46,328
Okay.

209
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,951
You need to take the rest of the day off.

210
00:11:47,953 --> 00:11:49,819
Dr. Melendez said that, too.

211
00:11:49,821 --> 00:11:51,191
- Why?
- "Why?"

212
00:11:51,193 --> 00:11:53,489
Because you just experienced
a traumatic event.

213
00:11:53,491 --> 00:11:55,491
- It's not my fault.
- I-I know that.

214
00:11:56,866 --> 00:11:58,461
Avery has multiple injuries.

215
00:11:58,463 --> 00:12:01,264
Dr. Melendez wants me to monitor her.

216
00:12:08,373 --> 00:12:09,739
Dr. Lim.

217
00:12:11,942 --> 00:12:12,976
I was out of line.

218
00:12:12,978 --> 00:12:14,243
I shouldn't have argued with you.

219
00:12:14,245 --> 00:12:15,578
Primary enclosure went well.

220
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,280
We'll extubate him in a few hours

221
00:12:17,282 --> 00:12:19,349
to prevent any further internal damage.

222
00:12:19,351 --> 00:12:20,617
Well, that's good.

223
00:12:20,619 --> 00:12:22,619
It is, and you're gonna
make sure he stays that way.

224
00:12:22,621 --> 00:12:25,270
You'll be babysitting tonight in the ICU.

225
00:12:26,854 --> 00:12:28,758
I'm... I'm not on call.

226
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,792
Great, then you're available.

227
00:12:29,794 --> 00:12:30,994
Should be a quiet night.

228
00:12:30,996 --> 00:12:32,829
Just want to keep an eye on those vitals.

229
00:12:32,831 --> 00:12:34,464
You never know with tracheal tears.

230
00:12:35,433 --> 00:12:37,066
Can't one of the ICU nurses do that?

231
00:12:37,068 --> 00:12:38,301
Yep.

232
00:12:38,303 --> 00:12:40,269
But they didn't lip off
in my operating room.

233
00:12:40,271 --> 00:12:42,772
And he'd better be breathing
in the morning.

234
00:12:48,042 --> 00:12:51,848
Excuse me, but why is Shaun
on the victim's case?

235
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:53,816
I assessed him,
and he seemed perfectly capable.

236
00:12:53,818 --> 00:12:55,051
You assessed him?

237
00:12:55,053 --> 00:12:57,086
What does that mean? You asked
him how he was feeling?

238
00:12:57,088 --> 00:12:58,254
You psychic?

239
00:12:58,256 --> 00:13:01,024
D-Do you have an advanced degree
in psychology?

240
00:13:01,026 --> 00:13:03,226
You don't know
what's going on in his head.

241
00:13:05,529 --> 00:13:07,897
When I'm in surgery,
my focus is on the person

242
00:13:07,899 --> 00:13:09,365
whose guts are open in front of me

243
00:13:09,367 --> 00:13:11,434
rather than the soul of the
person standing across from me.

244
00:13:11,436 --> 00:13:13,359
- No.
- And it seems that Shaun doesn't

245
00:13:13,384 --> 00:13:14,971
let <i>anything</i> impact his work.

246
00:13:14,973 --> 00:13:16,606
So, along with his photographic memory,

247
00:13:16,608 --> 00:13:18,841
I'm putting cold-hearted
in the plus column.

248
00:13:24,948 --> 00:13:28,166
Dr. Murphy, do you understand
why you're here?

249
00:13:28,753 --> 00:13:29,852
Yes.

250
00:13:29,854 --> 00:13:32,755
Dr. Glassman said I had to talk to you.

251
00:13:32,757 --> 00:13:35,625
After any doctor goes through
a potentially traumatic...

252
00:13:35,627 --> 00:13:38,094
You have to determine
if I'm a medicolegal liability

253
00:13:38,096 --> 00:13:39,683
- to the hospital.
- Yes.

254
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:42,598
And, more importantly,
it's an opportunity

255
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,967
to provide you with emotional support.

256
00:13:49,729 --> 00:13:51,240
How are you feeling?

257
00:13:53,107 --> 00:13:54,942
You don't have apples.

258
00:13:57,028 --> 00:13:59,182
I'll try to have some fruit
next time we meet.

259
00:13:59,822 --> 00:14:01,217
Good.

260
00:14:02,784 --> 00:14:05,722
Do you regret anything
about this morning?

261
00:14:07,872 --> 00:14:09,225
Why?

262
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:10,693
After bad things happen,

263
00:14:10,695 --> 00:14:12,762
it's perfectly normal
to replay the events,

264
00:14:12,764 --> 00:14:14,564
wishing you had done things differently.

265
00:14:14,566 --> 00:14:16,265
It already happened.

266
00:14:16,267 --> 00:14:18,174
I can't do things differently.

267
00:14:20,104 --> 00:14:22,472
Is talking about this upsetting you?

268
00:14:27,183 --> 00:14:29,312
What are you thinking about right now?

269
00:14:31,229 --> 00:14:35,184
Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome.

270
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:39,021
The surgery went well.

271
00:14:39,023 --> 00:14:41,023
After a serious trauma like this,

272
00:14:41,025 --> 00:14:42,225
the body can develop

273
00:14:42,227 --> 00:14:44,594
a self-destructive inflammatory reaction.

274
00:14:44,596 --> 00:14:46,662
Kidneys, liver, lungs, heart...

275
00:14:46,664 --> 00:14:49,365
any or all of them
can start to shut down.

276
00:14:49,367 --> 00:14:51,501
We'll be giving her anti-inflammatories

277
00:14:51,503 --> 00:14:52,935
and monitoring her closely,

278
00:14:52,937 --> 00:14:55,371
- but the next 24 hours are critical.
- Okay.

279
00:14:55,373 --> 00:14:56,539
Thanks.

280
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:58,074
Just get her through this.
Whatever you got to do.

281
00:14:58,076 --> 00:14:59,776
Yeah, well, I need consent forms

282
00:14:59,778 --> 00:15:01,374
from your girlfriend's next of kin.

283
00:15:01,895 --> 00:15:03,679
If you could please
get her family in here

284
00:15:03,681 --> 00:15:05,248
as quickly as possible.

285
00:15:08,385 --> 00:15:10,560
I can't. I...

286
00:15:14,564 --> 00:15:16,492
I don't even know her last name.

287
00:15:16,494 --> 00:15:17,960
It was our first date.

288
00:15:17,962 --> 00:15:19,462
W-We met on a dating app.

289
00:15:19,464 --> 00:15:20,596
We were going hiking,

290
00:15:20,598 --> 00:15:22,632
so she wasn't carrying a purse or ID.

291
00:15:23,364 --> 00:15:26,202
Well, then, you really
don't need to be here.

292
00:15:29,287 --> 00:15:30,673
Someone out there cares about her.

293
00:15:30,675 --> 00:15:31,774
If she dies,

294
00:15:31,776 --> 00:15:34,043
I want them to know someone was with her.

295
00:15:36,948 --> 00:15:40,449
I'll have social work
try to locate her family.

296
00:15:41,452 --> 00:15:43,553
Stay as long as you want.

297
00:15:54,464 --> 00:15:57,466
It looks clean, dry, and healthy.

298
00:15:57,468 --> 00:15:58,768
My neck is killing me.

299
00:16:01,805 --> 00:16:03,272
How long have you been using?

300
00:16:03,274 --> 00:16:05,341
What's that got to do with anything?

301
00:16:05,343 --> 00:16:07,844
Well, you likely built up
a tolerance to pain meds.

302
00:16:07,846 --> 00:16:10,046
Now that you <i>really</i> need them,
they aren't there for you.

303
00:16:10,048 --> 00:16:11,514
That's why I need fentanyl.

304
00:16:11,516 --> 00:16:13,649
100 micrograms.
Are you gonna help me or not?

305
00:16:13,651 --> 00:16:14,917
That wouldn't be helping.

306
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:16,619
The worst thing I can do for you
is feed your habit.

307
00:16:19,457 --> 00:16:20,656
What?

308
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:22,882
You saw my tattoo.

309
00:16:23,428 --> 00:16:24,594
Yeah.

310
00:16:24,596 --> 00:16:25,962
And now you're punishing me.

311
00:16:25,964 --> 00:16:27,730
You <i>want</i> this to hurt.

312
00:16:27,732 --> 00:16:29,432
- I'm treating you professionally.
- If you were treating me professionally,

313
00:16:29,434 --> 00:16:31,300
- I wouldn't be in so much pain.
- I'm sorry, but I...

314
00:16:31,302 --> 00:16:33,067
Just give me the damn drugs!

315
00:16:33,069 --> 00:16:34,644
Come on!

316
00:16:49,126 --> 00:16:53,208
Melendez thinks that he's okay
being on Avery's case.

317
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:54,597
I don't.

318
00:16:54,599 --> 00:16:56,766
Dr. Melendez may be right.

319
00:16:56,768 --> 00:16:58,922
That case seems to be
Shaun's primary focus right now.

320
00:16:58,924 --> 00:17:01,551
Maybe his condition is
a blessing in this situation.

321
00:17:01,552 --> 00:17:04,119
- Maybe?
- Or obsessing over Avery's health

322
00:17:04,121 --> 00:17:06,021
could be his only outlet
for a guilty conscience.

323
00:17:06,023 --> 00:17:08,457
Watching her suffer could just
be worsening those feelings.

324
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:09,858
So, either it's a huge problem

325
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,293
or it's not a problem at all.

326
00:17:11,295 --> 00:17:13,628
This is your professional opinion?

327
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:15,430
Shaun has a very unique mind

328
00:17:15,432 --> 00:17:17,666
and an incredibly introverted nature.

329
00:17:20,731 --> 00:17:22,804
Well, thank you for that.

330
00:17:23,734 --> 00:17:26,274
I'm sorry, but without
a lot more time with him,

331
00:17:26,276 --> 00:17:27,609
that's the best I can offer.

332
00:17:35,785 --> 00:17:37,586
What did Lim expect me to do...

333
00:17:37,588 --> 00:17:38,954
stand there and smile

334
00:17:38,956 --> 00:17:41,289
while she called my
medical judgment into question?

335
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:43,758
Your patient nearly died
waiting on that O.R., right?

336
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,627
It was bad. What do you want <i>me</i> to do?

337
00:17:45,629 --> 00:17:46,728
Tell her to back off!

338
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:48,430
- No.
- He's a complete and utter...

339
00:17:48,432 --> 00:17:50,098
Not one of those nice racists, huh?

340
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,933
- I shouldn't have to be...
- Claire!

341
00:17:51,935 --> 00:17:53,368
Here's what you have to do...

342
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:55,770
shut up and do exactly
what Dr. Lim tells you to do.

343
00:17:55,772 --> 00:17:56,826
But...

344
00:17:58,842 --> 00:17:59,937
Yes, sir.

345
00:18:10,052 --> 00:18:12,220
Maybe we could take turns.

346
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,422
You can keep an eye on my patient,

347
00:18:14,424 --> 00:18:15,924
I keep an eye on yours.

348
00:18:15,926 --> 00:18:16,958
No.

349
00:18:18,896 --> 00:18:22,043
Her creatinine is 1.6.

350
00:18:23,066 --> 00:18:24,733
Mild bump in renal numbers

351
00:18:24,735 --> 00:18:27,102
isn't surprising after all her trauma.

352
00:18:32,074 --> 00:18:33,929
This morning must've been crazy.

353
00:18:34,745 --> 00:18:36,278
Are you okay?

354
00:18:37,914 --> 00:18:39,047
This morning,

355
00:18:39,049 --> 00:18:41,416
my neighbor Lea came over
and ate my apple.

356
00:18:42,396 --> 00:18:44,152
That's too bad.

357
00:18:44,154 --> 00:18:45,887
Yes, it was my last one.

358
00:18:45,889 --> 00:18:48,490
She was upset with Armen, our landlord.

359
00:18:48,492 --> 00:18:50,625
She plays her music very loud.

360
00:18:51,113 --> 00:18:52,394
I gave her some advice.

361
00:18:52,396 --> 00:18:53,562
It seemed to anger her

362
00:18:53,564 --> 00:18:55,701
because she left without saying goodbye.

363
00:18:56,733 --> 00:18:58,954
And you think you did something wrong.

364
00:18:59,736 --> 00:19:02,070
No, it was good advice.

365
00:19:03,292 --> 00:19:05,507
Shaun, sometimes a woman wants advice,

366
00:19:05,509 --> 00:19:07,909
and sometimes she just wants support.

367
00:19:10,007 --> 00:19:12,385
How can I tell which one Lea wants?

368
00:19:14,117 --> 00:19:16,017
Err on the side of support.

369
00:19:16,019 --> 00:19:17,852
- That's not helpful.
- Yes, it is.

370
00:19:17,854 --> 00:19:20,222
Dr. Browne. You're being summoned.

371
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,980
All right.

372
00:19:28,332 --> 00:19:29,485
About time.

373
00:19:32,768 --> 00:19:34,936
All your struggling,
you've pulled out your IV.

374
00:19:36,472 --> 00:19:39,774
Aren't nurses usually supposed
to do this kind of crap?

375
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,878
They let you go to med school,

376
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,381
but they don't trust you
with any real responsibility.

377
00:19:47,169 --> 00:19:49,751
There must be a competent doctor
tucked around here somewhere

378
00:19:49,753 --> 00:19:51,953
who tell someone
I need more than aspirin.

379
00:19:51,955 --> 00:19:54,022
- "Competent"?
- Yeah.

380
00:19:54,024 --> 00:19:55,790
You know what I mean.

381
00:19:57,326 --> 00:20:00,562
Imhotep was the father
of modern medicine.

382
00:20:00,564 --> 00:20:02,264
- An Egyptian.
- Yeah.

383
00:20:02,266 --> 00:20:03,999
Good for your people.

384
00:20:05,202 --> 00:20:07,402
I'm willing to bet there's even
been a couple others

385
00:20:07,404 --> 00:20:10,238
over the last 3,000 years,
but guess what?

386
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,473
On average,

387
00:20:11,475 --> 00:20:13,942
you look at most great
technological advancements,

388
00:20:13,944 --> 00:20:15,977
you'll find a proud Northern European

389
00:20:15,979 --> 00:20:17,045
holding the patent.

390
00:20:17,971 --> 00:20:19,881
That's what you were trying
to do this morning?

391
00:20:19,883 --> 00:20:21,616
Get the patent on stealing 30 bucks

392
00:20:21,618 --> 00:20:23,581
from the corner store for a drug fix?

393
00:20:24,707 --> 00:20:26,721
You don't like drug addicts, do you?

394
00:20:27,757 --> 00:20:30,659
Mm, a lot of people I don't like.

395
00:20:31,547 --> 00:20:36,298
Thieves, racists, violent punks,

396
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,300
but I'll treat 'em.

397
00:20:40,303 --> 00:20:42,437
Was your mama a drug addict?

398
00:20:43,517 --> 00:20:44,561
Wow.

399
00:20:44,563 --> 00:20:46,941
That's the beauty of cliches,

400
00:20:46,943 --> 00:20:48,810
is they're true so often, huh?

401
00:20:48,812 --> 00:20:50,691
You don't know anything about me.

402
00:20:51,901 --> 00:20:53,736
I didn't go to college.

403
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:56,424
I didn't have no
affirmative action to get me in,

404
00:20:56,426 --> 00:20:57,485
but you did.

405
00:20:57,487 --> 00:21:00,422
All because some bleeding-heart
liberal in the Dean's office

406
00:21:00,424 --> 00:21:03,258
teared up reading your essay
about your crack-whore mama.

407
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,694
Aah! What the hell?

408
00:21:09,932 --> 00:21:11,700
I guess we're <i>all</i> violent punks.

409
00:21:29,313 --> 00:21:31,753
All you had to do
was give him your wallet.

410
00:21:47,122 --> 00:21:49,208
Her urine output is low.

411
00:21:49,506 --> 00:21:51,272
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing?!

412
00:21:51,274 --> 00:21:52,674
- Get away from her!
- Hey!

413
00:21:52,676 --> 00:21:54,642
You can't be in here
shoving my doctors around.

414
00:21:54,644 --> 00:21:56,465
Me? He... He's the...

415
00:21:58,749 --> 00:22:00,815
Oh, my God. She needs dialysis.

416
00:22:00,817 --> 00:22:02,350
Her kidneys are failing fast.

417
00:22:03,347 --> 00:22:06,721
This is the first stage
of total organ failure.

418
00:22:12,757 --> 00:22:15,624
We removed two liters
of excess fluid with dialysis,

419
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:16,925
but she's getting worse.

420
00:22:17,528 --> 00:22:19,169
Fluid's building up in her chest.

421
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,815
She's in pulmonary failure, too.

422
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,706
Draining the fluid in her pleural space

423
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:24,374
would reduce airway resistance.

424
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:26,120
Yeah, let's prep her for a thoracentesis.

425
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:28,479
We're gonna have to work fast.

426
00:22:28,956 --> 00:22:30,047
I'll prep the evac drain.

427
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:32,483
I'm gonna need you to put
that needle right between...

428
00:22:32,485 --> 00:22:33,717
6th and 7th rib.

429
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,527
Wait, you're gonna let <i>him</i> do...

430
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:45,028
Shut up. All right, careful.

431
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,497
Don't put the needle in too deep.

432
00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:48,398
- We don't want to give her...
- Pneumothorax.

433
00:22:50,069 --> 00:22:51,468
All right, you're in.

434
00:22:54,523 --> 00:22:56,773
Now, let me see what I can pull out.

435
00:22:58,244 --> 00:22:59,997
Hopefully she settles down.

436
00:23:15,671 --> 00:23:17,928
CO2's down, and O2's climbing.

437
00:23:20,131 --> 00:23:21,899
We can manage her kidneys and her lungs,

438
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:23,534
but the last stop
in multiple organ failure

439
00:23:23,536 --> 00:23:24,601
would be her heart.

440
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:27,538
Watch her ventilation pressures
like a hawk,

441
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:31,575
push cardioprotective meds,
and page me if anything changes.

442
00:23:33,604 --> 00:23:35,189
Think you're being her hero?

443
00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:37,441
The fact is you hardly know her.

444
00:23:37,663 --> 00:23:39,234
And you don't know <i>him</i> at all.

445
00:23:40,186 --> 00:23:41,952
Go home.

446
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:49,726
Yep.

447
00:23:56,534 --> 00:23:57,935
Okay, I am done.

448
00:23:57,937 --> 00:24:00,204
He's a foul-mouthed, spiteful bully.

449
00:24:00,206 --> 00:24:01,305
No problem.

450
00:24:01,307 --> 00:24:03,106
I'll have the concierge find a patient

451
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,908
more suited to your liking.

452
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:07,444
He doesn't need a doctor doting over him.

453
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,012
He doesn't <i>want</i> me.

454
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:10,180
I don't care.

455
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:13,850
I'm sorry I disagreed with you, okay?

456
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:17,354
But I don't deserve
to be scolded like a school girl

457
00:24:17,356 --> 00:24:20,324
because your ego can't handle
being challenged a little.

458
00:24:20,326 --> 00:24:21,458
Oh.

459
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,026
That is some apology.

460
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:24,528
Look, I had a legitimate...

461
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:26,029
You really don't see the problem here?

462
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:28,198
What? With challenging you?

463
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:32,336
Right now, you are confronting me

464
00:24:32,338 --> 00:24:34,338
in front of two nurses.

465
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,373
Would you do that to Melendez?

466
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:38,508
Or would you wait five minutes?

467
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,412
I have dealt with men

468
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:44,881
undermining my authority
my entire career.

469
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,184
We shouldn't do it to one another, too.

470
00:24:47,594 --> 00:24:50,854
Now go take care of him like
you would any other patient.

471
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,266
Hey. Hey! Hey!

472
00:25:02,268 --> 00:25:05,135
Food services...
they double-check every order.

473
00:25:05,137 --> 00:25:06,203
What are you looking for?

474
00:25:06,205 --> 00:25:07,397
- An apple.
- An apple?

475
00:25:07,399 --> 00:25:08,739
- Who's getting an apple?
- I am!

476
00:25:08,741 --> 00:25:09,873
- No.
- Shaun.

477
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:11,534
Forget the apple, please.

478
00:25:11,536 --> 00:25:13,543
I'm sorry. Can I have a minute?

479
00:25:13,958 --> 00:25:15,191
Shaun?

480
00:25:16,314 --> 00:25:17,506
Okay.

481
00:25:22,054 --> 00:25:24,554
Shaun, there's no need
to get defensive, okay?

482
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:25,756
Do you want to sit down?

483
00:25:25,758 --> 00:25:27,009
No, thank you.

484
00:25:28,469 --> 00:25:30,861
I want you to tell me again

485
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:32,496
exactly what happened this morning.

486
00:25:32,498 --> 00:25:34,531
I told you exactly
what happened this morning.

487
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:37,334
Yes, but people have told you
that it's your fault.

488
00:25:37,336 --> 00:25:38,735
Haven't they?

489
00:25:38,737 --> 00:25:41,972
My actions and the shooting
were associative incidents.

490
00:25:41,974 --> 00:25:44,241
It is not a causal relationship.

491
00:25:44,243 --> 00:25:45,409
I paced, and she got shot,

492
00:25:45,411 --> 00:25:46,877
but pacing doesn't cause shootings,

493
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:48,345
otherwise every time someone paced,

494
00:25:48,347 --> 00:25:49,613
a shooting would soon follow.

495
00:25:49,615 --> 00:25:51,748
Okay, that's a very good point.

496
00:25:54,285 --> 00:25:56,553
When someone has a gun

497
00:25:56,955 --> 00:25:59,890
and it's a dangerous situation, right?

498
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:02,659
You don't want to upset the situation.

499
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:04,227
You don't want to make it worse.

500
00:26:04,713 --> 00:26:07,130
You think this is my fault, too.

501
00:26:07,674 --> 00:26:09,633
No, no, it was the shoot...

502
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:12,703
It was the shooter's fault,

503
00:26:12,705 --> 00:26:15,706
but your actions
may have contributed to it.

504
00:26:15,708 --> 00:26:17,374
Okay, Shaun, wait a second.

505
00:26:17,376 --> 00:26:18,441
Wait a second.

506
00:26:18,443 --> 00:26:22,045
I know your behavior is not
completely in your control,

507
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:24,214
but I also know it's not
completely <i>out</i> of your control.

508
00:26:24,216 --> 00:26:25,282
Is it?

509
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:29,238
So, yes, maybe it is
a little bit your fault.

510
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:33,490
And definitely mine.

511
00:26:33,492 --> 00:26:35,926
You weren't even there.

512
00:26:37,462 --> 00:26:38,789
That's right.

513
00:26:39,231 --> 00:26:40,624
I wasn't there.

514
00:26:43,585 --> 00:26:45,902
Can we sit down, please,
just for a second?

515
00:26:53,379 --> 00:26:54,845
Shaun...

516
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:57,180
I convinced myself
that everything was fine

517
00:26:57,182 --> 00:26:59,516
because in here, it is.

518
00:26:59,518 --> 00:27:00,884
It's great.

519
00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:02,886
But you need help.

520
00:27:03,855 --> 00:27:05,122
Shaun...

521
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:07,859
you need guidance...

522
00:27:08,894 --> 00:27:11,196
much more than I can give you.

523
00:27:16,322 --> 00:27:18,201
I'm supposed to be with my patient.

524
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:20,664
I'm supposed to be watching her
like a hawk.

525
00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:44,146
It's my fault.

526
00:27:48,766 --> 00:27:50,133
I didn't like her.

527
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:52,487
When I first saw her
this morning, she just...

528
00:27:53,078 --> 00:27:55,198
didn't look...

529
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,618
I don't know.

530
00:28:04,348 --> 00:28:06,002
I mean, I wanted to blow her off,

531
00:28:06,004 --> 00:28:08,785
so, uh... I said I forgot water.

532
00:28:09,838 --> 00:28:11,288
I mean, I figured we'd go to the store

533
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:13,290
and... and I'd pretend
that I forgot my wallet.

534
00:28:13,292 --> 00:28:15,091
I knew she didn't have her purse, so...

535
00:28:15,636 --> 00:28:18,347
We can't go hiking without water, right?

536
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:20,766
I mean, no harm, no foul?

537
00:28:22,392 --> 00:28:23,700
Mm.

538
00:28:25,103 --> 00:28:27,105
She was there because of me.

539
00:28:29,566 --> 00:28:31,174
She's <i>here...</i>

540
00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:32,611
because of me.

541
00:28:34,655 --> 00:28:37,199
It's not a causal relationship.

542
00:28:38,909 --> 00:28:40,984
Wait, excuse me?

543
00:28:44,156 --> 00:28:46,035
It's not a causal relationship...

544
00:28:46,037 --> 00:28:47,170
lying and shootings.

545
00:28:47,172 --> 00:28:48,458
Lying doesn't cause shootings,

546
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,793
otherwise, every time someone lied...

547
00:28:51,497 --> 00:28:52,964
Her pulse pressure is narrow.

548
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:54,865
Wait, what does that mean?

549
00:28:54,867 --> 00:28:55,932
She's dying.

550
00:28:56,343 --> 00:28:57,767
Page Melendez. Stat!

551
00:29:05,435 --> 00:29:07,077
Your respiratory rate is up.

552
00:29:07,396 --> 00:29:09,045
Are you having trouble breathing?

553
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:10,313
Yeah. It's tight.

554
00:29:18,222 --> 00:29:20,075
Find Dr. Lim.

555
00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:24,461
Narrow pulse pressure indicates
a reduced cardiac output.

556
00:29:24,463 --> 00:29:26,596
The inflammation is affecting her heart.

557
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,431
She's in end-stage organ failure.

558
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,367
Yes, we can insert
an intra-aortic balloon pump.

559
00:29:30,369 --> 00:29:31,801
It may reduce some
of the workload on her heart,

560
00:29:31,803 --> 00:29:34,004
but it's failing fast... really fast.

561
00:29:34,006 --> 00:29:35,639
It only needs to work overnight.

562
00:29:35,641 --> 00:29:37,574
The inflammatory reaction
will improve after that.

563
00:29:37,576 --> 00:29:39,709
What if it's failing so fast
because it's not her heart?

564
00:29:41,213 --> 00:29:42,979
Her hemoglobin's dropped from 14 to 12

565
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:44,180
between her last two draws.

566
00:29:44,182 --> 00:29:46,216
What if the real problem
is she's bleeding somewhere?

567
00:29:46,218 --> 00:29:48,482
Given what she's been through, a
two-point drop could mean nothing.

568
00:29:48,484 --> 00:29:50,253
Or it could mean a bleed,

569
00:29:50,255 --> 00:29:51,454
which would account
for the narrow pulse pressure.

570
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:52,589
Her heart could be fine.

571
00:29:54,326 --> 00:29:56,526
If you're right, that means
we'd have to open her back up.

572
00:29:56,528 --> 00:29:58,595
I don't know if her body
can handle another operation.

573
00:29:58,597 --> 00:29:59,763
No, it can't.

574
00:29:59,765 --> 00:30:01,665
Treating heart failure
with an aortic pump

575
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:03,166
is also a simple procedure.

576
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:04,968
So we're going to diagnose

577
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,703
based on which procedure is simpler?

578
00:30:06,705 --> 00:30:08,605
If I'm right, there could be
no more blood to pump.

579
00:30:08,607 --> 00:30:09,606
She'll be dead.

580
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:14,377
She's crashing!

581
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:16,346
We should prepare the cath lab
for a pump.

582
00:30:16,348 --> 00:30:17,714
We should prepare the O.R.

583
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:23,420
Let's get her into an O.R. now.

584
00:30:33,649 --> 00:30:35,649
Hemoglobin's dropped to 8.

585
00:30:35,651 --> 00:30:37,718
She is bleeding out.

586
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,086
Yes, she is, but where?

587
00:30:39,088 --> 00:30:40,754
Got to find
where the bleeder's coming from

588
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:42,456
and clip it before she dies.

589
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:44,803
I got nothing.

590
00:30:44,805 --> 00:30:47,060
Must be hidden under the
retroperitoneum or mediastinum.

591
00:30:47,062 --> 00:30:48,462
That's a whole lot of real estate

592
00:30:48,464 --> 00:30:49,837
to cut open and just go blindly looking.

593
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:51,765
We should start at the abdomen.
She was shot there.

594
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:53,560
The bullet passed through
the posterior thorax.

595
00:30:53,562 --> 00:30:55,736
BP's 40 over palp. She's dying, Neil.

596
00:30:55,738 --> 00:30:57,538
Whatever you're gonna do,
you need to do it now.

597
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:59,740
We need to look everywhere.
Give me a knife and sternal saw.

598
00:30:59,742 --> 00:31:01,141
I'm gonna open her up
from chest to pelvis.

599
00:31:02,578 --> 00:31:05,145
Prep the sternum and abdomen
with Betadine.

600
00:31:05,644 --> 00:31:06,847
Gonna need a sponge stick

601
00:31:06,849 --> 00:31:08,849
to control the bleeding when we find it.

602
00:31:18,226 --> 00:31:19,426
Stop!

603
00:31:21,947 --> 00:31:26,837
Open her between the second
and third rib on the left side.

604
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:29,169
The bullet nicked the left
supreme intercostal artery.

605
00:31:29,171 --> 00:31:30,170
The wall has blown.

606
00:31:30,172 --> 00:31:31,305
How do you know?

607
00:31:31,307 --> 00:31:33,566
I followed the injuries...

608
00:31:33,568 --> 00:31:35,909
pelvis to bowel to spleen to diaphragm.

609
00:31:35,911 --> 00:31:39,246
Next target has to be
left supreme intercostal artery.

610
00:31:40,819 --> 00:31:42,783
All right, prep left intercostal space.

611
00:31:49,692 --> 00:31:50,657
I can't breathe.

612
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:52,359
Why aren't you helping me?

613
00:31:52,361 --> 00:31:54,294
Dr. Lim will be along
in just two minutes.

614
00:31:54,296 --> 00:31:55,796
You're the damn doctor. Do your job.

615
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:09,042
I need to open up
the left neck compartment

616
00:32:09,044 --> 00:32:11,044
to relieve the pressure.

617
00:32:11,046 --> 00:32:12,289
Procedure tray?

618
00:32:17,151 --> 00:32:18,819
You done this before?

619
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:21,590
Nope.

620
00:32:21,592 --> 00:32:22,923
Scalpel.

621
00:32:30,373 --> 00:32:31,483
It's too swollen.

622
00:32:31,485 --> 00:32:33,143
I can't see the Adam's apple.

623
00:32:33,602 --> 00:32:34,601
Okay.

624
00:32:34,603 --> 00:32:36,937
Cut along the soft divot

625
00:32:36,939 --> 00:32:39,162
between the carotid sheath
and the trachea.

626
00:32:39,164 --> 00:32:40,429
Soft divot.

627
00:32:40,431 --> 00:32:41,776
Got it.

628
00:32:55,023 --> 00:32:57,090
Update me.

629
00:32:58,127 --> 00:33:00,391
What did you do?

630
00:33:00,393 --> 00:33:02,763
He had a cervical hematoma.
I had to relieve the pressure.

631
00:33:02,765 --> 00:33:03,764
Here?

632
00:33:08,397 --> 00:33:10,304
Oxygen sats are going up.

633
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:12,139
It's rare,

634
00:33:12,141 --> 00:33:14,074
but post-op swelling can happen
with tracheal tears.

635
00:33:14,076 --> 00:33:16,576
That's why we watch them
so closely the first 24 hours.

636
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:19,356
You mind if we finish this off
in the operating room?

637
00:33:23,319 --> 00:33:25,218
I don't see anything, Shaun...

638
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,087
no blood and no arterial tear.

639
00:33:27,089 --> 00:33:28,121
You're too high.

640
00:33:28,123 --> 00:33:29,856
It's near the bifurcation.

641
00:33:29,858 --> 00:33:30,991
Get some light in.

642
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:38,604
I got something. Blood's pooling
right under the bifurcation.

643
00:33:38,606 --> 00:33:39,786
Clamp now.

644
00:33:55,918 --> 00:33:58,018
She wasn't in heart failure.

645
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:00,487
That means her heart is still strong
enough to get her through the night.

646
00:34:01,481 --> 00:34:03,190
I was wrong.

647
00:34:03,942 --> 00:34:05,158
Yeah.

648
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,986
And you just made up for it.

649
00:34:10,337 --> 00:34:11,832
You were right, Jared.

650
00:34:15,375 --> 00:34:16,815
Good work.

651
00:34:42,697 --> 00:34:44,531
You know what?

652
00:34:44,533 --> 00:34:45,799
You were right.

653
00:34:45,801 --> 00:34:47,567
My mother had problems.

654
00:34:47,569 --> 00:34:49,903
So I couldn't afford to just around

655
00:34:49,905 --> 00:34:51,905
expecting everything to be handed to me

656
00:34:51,907 --> 00:34:54,741
or whatever else it is
that's holding you back.

657
00:34:54,743 --> 00:34:56,676
And yeah, I got some breaks,

658
00:34:56,678 --> 00:34:58,378
but I worked my ass off.

659
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:01,581
Two jobs, two roommates
every step of the way.

660
00:35:01,583 --> 00:35:04,151
And that is what got me to the place

661
00:35:04,153 --> 00:35:05,754
where I could save your life.

662
00:35:20,826 --> 00:35:22,327
Your daughter's not out of the woods yet,

663
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:24,844
but I do expect her condition
to improve day by day.

664
00:35:26,127 --> 00:35:27,188
Thank you, Doctor.

665
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:28,543
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

666
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,414
Mm.

667
00:35:42,482 --> 00:35:44,709
- Hey.
- Hi.

668
00:35:44,711 --> 00:35:45,769
Baby.

669
00:35:45,771 --> 00:35:47,819
Sorry we weren't here for you.

670
00:35:47,821 --> 00:35:49,154
How are you feeling?

671
00:35:49,156 --> 00:35:50,288
Uh...

672
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:52,885
probably won't be hiking anytime soon.

673
00:35:54,511 --> 00:35:56,461
Mm.

674
00:35:57,138 --> 00:35:58,830
Hey.

675
00:35:59,224 --> 00:36:01,643
You sneaking out before I can thank you?

676
00:36:03,394 --> 00:36:05,770
Please, you don't need to thank me.

677
00:36:05,772 --> 00:36:07,038
Oh.

678
00:36:07,398 --> 00:36:08,940
Yeah, I do.

679
00:36:10,026 --> 00:36:11,501
And apologize.

680
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:14,879
I was wrong about you.

681
00:36:18,744 --> 00:36:21,019
I thought you were trying to ditch me.

682
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:25,290
I was...

683
00:36:25,292 --> 00:36:28,893
<i>hoping</i> you were trying to ditch me.

684
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:34,232
I'm sorry.

685
00:36:38,411 --> 00:36:39,604
When you're feeling better,

686
00:36:39,606 --> 00:36:42,173
I'd like a second chance at a first date.

687
00:37:02,203 --> 00:37:03,561
I'm sorry.

688
00:37:06,867 --> 00:37:08,199
You were right.

689
00:37:08,201 --> 00:37:10,702
I publicly disrespected you,

690
00:37:10,704 --> 00:37:12,837
and so I thought it only right

691
00:37:12,839 --> 00:37:14,405
to publicly respect you.

692
00:37:18,581 --> 00:37:19,699
I am grateful

693
00:37:20,115 --> 00:37:21,711
for the chance to learn from you.

694
00:37:24,587 --> 00:37:26,417
I know you needed this victory.

695
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:28,820
Glad you saved a life today.

696
00:37:29,397 --> 00:37:31,189
Just wish it wasn't a Nazi.

697
00:38:02,022 --> 00:38:04,022
Lane number two.

698
00:38:05,308 --> 00:38:06,991
Maddie always took that lane.

699
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:08,693
She would tuck in behind me

700
00:38:08,695 --> 00:38:12,030
and draft until the last 200 meters.

701
00:38:13,149 --> 00:38:14,766
It was a dirty little trick.

702
00:38:16,036 --> 00:38:18,236
- It worked.
- Every time.

703
00:38:24,577 --> 00:38:26,577
13 years ago today.

704
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:28,913
Yeah.

705
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,549
I miss her, too.

706
00:38:35,296 --> 00:38:38,257
Give her space, right?

707
00:38:38,259 --> 00:38:39,524
Give her space.

708
00:38:40,426 --> 00:38:42,694
She just drifted
farther and farther away.

709
00:38:42,696 --> 00:38:44,929
Everything I did...

710
00:38:44,931 --> 00:38:46,531
I did wrong.

711
00:38:47,475 --> 00:38:48,599
You did your best.

712
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:52,403
I was...

713
00:38:52,855 --> 00:38:57,575
practically living at your house
back then, and...

714
00:38:58,528 --> 00:38:59,605
If I hadn't...

715
00:39:00,607 --> 00:39:04,375
You were both teenagers.

716
00:39:04,377 --> 00:39:05,483
You were idiots.

717
00:39:06,828 --> 00:39:08,621
You got lucky, she didn't.

718
00:39:12,291 --> 00:39:13,925
If I...

719
00:39:14,502 --> 00:39:16,295
was there more...

720
00:39:17,672 --> 00:39:18,803
if I...

721
00:39:20,425 --> 00:39:21,936
stayed on her...

722
00:39:25,179 --> 00:39:26,904
You're there for <i>him.</i>

723
00:39:34,547 --> 00:39:36,414
<i>Here's your extended
forecast for the week.</i>

724
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:38,049
<i>Starting off with a little bit
of cloud cover</i>

725
00:39:38,051 --> 00:39:39,550
<i>in San Francisco,
temperatures in the low 70s...</i>

726
00:39:40,987 --> 00:39:43,388
<i>...just a few degrees as we get
closer to the weekend.</i>

727
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:45,957
<i>Expect dry conditions
for the next seven days here...</i>

728
00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:50,061
I, uh, saw your light.

729
00:39:56,236 --> 00:39:57,962
I'm sorry.

730
00:40:00,381 --> 00:40:01,539
Claire told me to apologize

731
00:40:01,541 --> 00:40:03,708
because you didn't want me
to tell the truth.

732
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:06,044
You only wanted me
to support your position,

733
00:40:06,046 --> 00:40:07,805
even though it's wrong.

734
00:40:11,309 --> 00:40:12,817
Well, I don't accept.

735
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:18,719
I may have overreacted
this morning a little.

736
00:40:19,715 --> 00:40:22,440
And you were honest... brutally honest...

737
00:40:22,442 --> 00:40:26,115
but you shouldn't have to wear
ear plugs in your own home.

738
00:40:27,742 --> 00:40:30,711
And don't start lying to me
to make me feel good.

739
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:33,677
You're the only honest guy I know.

740
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:38,676
So...

741
00:40:41,181 --> 00:40:44,348
...have a good night, Shaun Murphy.

742
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:47,185
