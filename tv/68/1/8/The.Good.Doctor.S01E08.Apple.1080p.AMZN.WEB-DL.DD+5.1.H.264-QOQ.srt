你都不知道昨晚阿尔蒙干了什么破事
You won't believe the crap Armen pulled last night.

40
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,210
他断了我公寓的电
He cut the power to my apartment!

41
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,080
好啊
That's right!

42
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:03,910
没灯  没无线网  啥都没有
No lights, no Wi-Fi, nothing.

43
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,520
断了十五分钟
For 15 minutes!

44
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:09,230
如果我当时戴着呼吸器
And if I had been on a ventilator,

45
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:11,810
肯定早就窒息而死了  对吧
I could've suffocated in that time, right?

46
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:12,870
你是个医生
You're a doctor.

47
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,340
你没戴呼吸器
You're not on a ventilator.

48
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,900
真是谢天谢地了  但有可能啊
Thank God for that. But I could be.

49
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,250
当时一片漆黑  我可能会绊倒
I mean, it was dark. I could've tripped.

50
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,540
真该起诉他
I should sue him.

51
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,140
抱歉  你要吃的吧
Sorry. Were you gonna eat this?

52
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,250
「愤怒为食量」
I stress eat.

53
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:27,570
听着
Okay, listen.

54
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:28,440
我去问他时
I go to talk to him,

55
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,520
他怪我又把音乐开到很大声
and he claims I was playing my music too loud again.

56
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,930
你的音乐吵到我时我会戴耳塞
I wear earplugs when your music irritates me.

57
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,720
我没听到水滴声
I miss the dripping.

58
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,520
你没听懂重点  肖恩  好吗
You're missing the point here, Shaun, okay?

59
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,990
你得敲门  询问
You knock. You ask.

60
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:43,610
而不是断了某人的电
You don't cut someone's power.

61
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:44,970
你会敲门的吧
You knock, right?

62
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,730
你当然会敲啊  正常人都会
Of course, you would knock. Any normal person would.

63
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:50,420
是我疯了  还是他是个反社会者
I mean, am I crazy or is he a total sociopath?

64
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,020
你该戴耳机
You should get headphones.

65
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:53,850
耳机
Headphones?

66
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:55,760
那样可以降低声音
They would eliminate the sound.

67
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,590
我明白
Yeah. I got it.

68
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:59,280
谢谢
Thank you.

69
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,720
谢谢你对这事如此客观公正
Thank you for being so objective about this.

70
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:03,580
其实你不如去帮阿尔蒙
In fact, why don't you go help Armen

71
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,170
写我的搬出通知吧
write my eviction notice!

72
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,700
对  我开车再也不走那条路了
Yeah, and I'll never drive down that street again.

73
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,270
相当可怕的回忆
It's a pretty bad memory.

74
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,860
是  听着确实如此
Yeah, that sounds pretty...

75
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,800
等等  徒步旅行会很热吧
Wait, it's kind of hot for a hike, isn't it?

76
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,650
徒步旅行就会出汗  很正常
We're hiking. We're gonna sweat. It happens.

77
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:37,800
都听好  别做傻事
All right, don't do nothing stupid!

78
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,190
打开收银机  把东西放袋子里
Open the register and put everything in the bag!

79
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:41,050
快  赶紧的
Come on! Right now! 

80
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,250
别动  钱包  手机  啥都交出来
Don't move. Give me your wallets, phones, everything.

81
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,630
手放到我能看见的地方
Keep your hands where I can see 'em.

82
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:46,800
把钱包交出来
I said get out your wallet!

83
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,010
快
Do it now!

84
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,310
钱包  快
Wallet, now!

85
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,520
他没事吧
Is he okay? 

86
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,430
不知道  是从野外基地转过来的
We don't know. This is routed through Basecamp.

It says Shaun was there,

88

不知道他有没有受伤
but it didn't say if he was hurt or not.

89
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,380
急救人员正在送两名重伤人员过来
Well, EMS has two critical inbounding.

都怪他
It's his fault.

145
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:10,050
莫菲去拿超声仪
Hey, Murphy, get us the ultrasound 

146
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:11,680
看看里面情况如何

创伤重点评估超声仪

血氧饱和70

150
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,710
摄像头无法通过塌陷部分
I can't squeeze a camera past this collapse.

151
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:35,600
三号手术室准备完毕  但就这一间了
O.R. 3 is prepped and ready, but that's it.

152
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,450
其他手术室都正在使用中
We got a full house right now up in surgery.

153
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:39,840
-最快也要十五分钟后  -我要手术室
- Next show time is 15 minutes out. - I could use it.

154
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,170
我得控制出大出血
I gotta get this bleeding under control.

155
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:42,600
你们那边情况如何
What's the status on your guy?

156
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,390
带她去  带中枪的人去
Take her up. Take the gunshot.

157
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,080
等等
Hold on.

158
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,610
他的气道受损严重  都没法做气管切开术
His airway's so damaged, I can't even do a tracheotomy.

159
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,350
还有五分钟他就缺氧性脑死亡了
He's got five minutes until anoxic brain dead.

160
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,310
我按压住出血了  我会想办法的
Mine's got pressure. I'll see what I can do here.

161
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,610
你跟我一起刷手准备手术
You're scrubbing in with me.

162
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:59,160
把插管插入塌陷的气管下面

好了
And we're good.

165
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:16,640
现在病患能真正呼吸了
Now that our patient is actually breathing,

166
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,180
可以重新调整和修复了
we can realign and repair.

167
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,400
持针器穿4-0的缝线
Four-O on a driver.

168
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,250
剪刀  海绵钳
Scissors. Sponge stick.

169
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,280
对病患的看法影响了你的医学判断
It's a slippery thing letting your feelings about a patient

170
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,030
这是很危险的
influence your medical judgment.

171
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:30,680
我没有
I didn't.

172
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:32,830
我察觉到了  她是受害者
I get the instinct -- She's a victim.

173
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:35,070
而他是枪手  还是种族歧视者
He's a shooter, a racist.

174
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,630
我们经常不知道自己在干什么
Often we don't even know we're doing it.

175
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:39,590
我绝不会让个人感情影响病患的治疗
I would never let my personal feelings impact a patient's care.

176
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,670
她快流血而死了
She was bleeding out.

177
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:43,110
而他三十秒前才恢复正常呼吸
And this guy just drew his first good breath 30 seconds ago.

178
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,080
他俩都是重伤
They were both critical!

179
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,490
他快死了  你错了  承认吧
He was dying. You were wrong. Own it.

180
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,570
你我都知道当时很难做出选择
You know as well as I do that that was not an easy call to make.

181
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:50,870
-我知道  -对
- Do I? - Yes!

182
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,110
把这清理干净  布朗医生
Clear the field, Dr. Browne.

183
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,750
不是我动手术的地方
Not my operative field.

184
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,610
是手术室  刷手出去吧
The surgical field. Scrub out.

185
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,830
你说什么
Excuse me?

186
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:05,780
没你事了
You're done.

187
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,150
离开我的手术室
Step out of my O.R.

188
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:09,960
吉尔  麻烦帮布朗医生脱去装备
Gail, can you please relieve Dr. Browne of her instruments

189
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,950
呼叫克莱兰医生来协助我
and page Dr. Cleland to assist me?

190
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,920
是不是更自在了
Now, isn't this more pleasant?

191
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,840
除了脾脏  还要处理哪里
Aside from the spleen, what else are we dealing with?

192
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:31,280
子弹导致她的横结肠在脾曲处
The bullet ruptured her transverse colon

193
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,500
出现了破裂
at the splenic flexure.

194
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,090
划为待做事项
Put it on our to-do list.

195
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,430
她的男友为什么认为是你的错
Why does her boyfriend think it's your fault?

196
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,830
子弹刺伤了隔膜
It punctured her diaphragm here

197
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:43,940
射入了后胸部
and entered the posterior chest.

198
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,040
又出血了  夹住肺门
She's bleeding again. Clamp the hilum.

199
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,860
已经夹了  伤太重止不住
I already did. It's too damaged to hold.

200
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:50,740
纱布
Gauze!

201
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:55,850
按住这里  别松手
Hold this right there. Don't let go.

202
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:58,580
不行
Oh, this isn't gonna work.

203
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,650
这就像把绞碎的牛肉缝合成牛排
It's gonna be like sewing ground beef back into a steak.

204
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:02,340
新方案  她只能摘除脾脏保命了
All right, new plan -- she's gonna have to live without her spleen.

205
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,440
护士递手术刀
Nurse to pick up.

206
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,600
在我切开时  得用缝线结扎脾动脉
Need a ligating suture on the splenic artery while I make the cut.

207
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,700
能在这姑娘的血喷我们一身之前帮我处理好吗
Can you do that for me before this young lady bleeds out on us,

208
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,390
莫菲
Murphy?

209
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:12,860
好的
Yes.

210
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:28,000
{\an1}BGM: Infinity by One Hundred Years

211
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,240
好了  现在开始修补肠破裂
Okay, let's move on to the bowel perf.

212
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,050
肖恩
Shaun.

213
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,350
谢天谢地你没事
Ah, thank God you're all right.

214
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:22,270
我刚刚听说了早上的意外
I just heard what happened.

215
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:27,320
肖恩  你没事吧
Shaun. Are you all right?

216
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,530
没事  我没受伤
Yes. I wasn't injured.

217
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,020
早上到底发生什么了
What happened this morning?

218
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,090
莉亚吃了我的苹果
Lea ate my apple.

219
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:37,020
不是  肖恩  今天早上在商店
No, Shaun, at the store this morning.

220
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,140
在商店发生什么了
What happened at the store?

221
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,080
钱包  立刻
Wallet now!

222
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:44,080
我不能
I can't.

223
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,170
为什么
Why the hell not?!

224
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,090
你说要把手放在你能看得到的地方
You said keep my hands where you could see them.

225
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,430
我的钱包在口袋里
My wallet is in my pocket.

226
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:53,200
如果我掏钱包你就看不见我的手了
You can't see my hands if

227
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,540
你是想英雄救美吗
-- Are you trying to be a hero?!

228
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,680
我是个外科住院医师
I'm a surgical resident --

229
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,970
妈的闭嘴
Shut the hell up!

230
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,130
这可不是做游戏  伙计  我是来真的
This isn't a game, man. I'm serious. Okay.

231
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:02,300
马上把你该死的手机和钱包放到地上
Put your damn phone and wallet on the ground right now.

232
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,340
看见这个了吗  伙计  我不是在过家家
Hey, do you see this, man? I am not playing around!

233
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,590
把你该死的手机和钱包放到地上
Just put your phone and wallet on the damn ground!

234
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,740
快点  伙计  按他说的做
Come on, man, just -- just do what he says!

235
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,080
求你按他说的做
Please listen to him.

236
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,020
闭嘴  跪下
Shut up! Just shut up and get on your knees!

237
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,450
把手和膝盖放在地上
Put your hands and knees on the ground.

238
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:15,050
现在把你钱包掏出来
Get your wallet out right now.

239
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,500
我会把你打个稀巴烂  我发誓
I will shoot your crazy ass, I swear to God. Okay.

240
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,650
你听见我说话了吗  我会开枪的
Are you listening to me?! I'll do it! Yes.

241
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:20,590
你听见了吗
You hear me?

242
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:31,970
天哪
Oh, my God!

243
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:45,340
好吧
Okay.

244
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,110
你该回去休息
You need to take the rest of the day off.

245
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:49,010
梅伦德斯医生也这么说
Dr. Melendez said that, too.

246
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:49,700
为什么
Why?

247
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,550
「为什么」  因为你刚刚经历了创伤性事件
"Why?" Because you just experienced a traumatic event.

248
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,810
-这不是我的错  -我知道
- It's not my fault. - I-I know that.

249
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,650
艾莉身上多处创伤
Avery has multiple injuries.

250
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,640
梅伦德斯医生让我照看她
Dr. Melendez wants me to monitor her.

251
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:08,620
利姆医生
Dr. Lim.

252
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,430
是我太过分了
I was out of line.

253
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:13,190
我不应该跟你理论
I shouldn't have argued with you.

254
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,640
一期缝合情况良好
Primary enclosure went well.

255
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,130
几个小时后就可以拔管
We'll extubate him in a few hours

256
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:18,620
以防止更深层次的脏器损害
to prevent any further internal damage.

257
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,610
那很好
Well, that's good.

258
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:21,930
确实  你要保证他继续稳定恢复
It is, and you're gonna make sure he stays that way.

259
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:24,190
今晚你要在重症监护室里看护他
You'll be babysitting tonight in the ICU.

260
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,860
我  我今晚不值班
I'm -- I'm not on call.

261
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,030
很好  那你有空
Great, then you're available.

262
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,260
今晚应该会很清闲
Should be a quiet night.

263
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,980
只要注意监测生命体征就行
Just want to keep an eye on those vitals.

264
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,970
你永远也不知道什么时候会发生气管撕裂
You never know with tracheal tears.

265
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,360
这事就不能交给重症监护室的护士吗
Can't one of the ICU nurses do that?

266
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,160
可以
Yep.

267
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:39,430
但她们没在我的手术室里出言不逊
But they didn't lip off in my operating room.

268
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:41,190
他最好明早还活着
And he'd better be breathing in the morning.

269
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:50,910
打扰一下  为什么肖恩在处理受害者的病例
Excuse me, but why is Shaun on the victim's case?

270
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:53,280
我评估过了  他没什么事
I assessed him, and he seemed perfectly capable.

271
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,200
你评估了
You assessed him?

272
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,470
这是什么意思  你问过他感觉如何
What does that mean? You asked him how he was feeling?

273
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,860
你会读心术
You psychic?

274
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,190
你有心理学的高等学位
D-Do you have an advanced degree in psychology?

275
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:02,300
你根本不知道他脑子里在想些什么
You don't know what's going on in his head.

276
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:06,080
我在手术室里的时候
When I'm in surgery,

277
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,220
注意力是集中在我面前开膛破肚的病人身上
my focus is on the person whose guts are open in front of me

278
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,830
而不是站我对面的人的心理活动
rather than the soul of the person standing across from me.

279
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:11,670
当然
No.

280
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,200
而且似乎肖恩不会让任何事情影响他工作
And it seems that Shaun doesn't let anything impact his work.

281
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,810
所以和他过目不忘的本事一样
So, along with his photographic memory,

282
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:17,970
我把冷酷无情也算作加分项了
I'm putting cold-hearted in the plus column.

283
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:27,040
莫菲医生  你知道我为什么找你来吗
Dr. Murphy, do you understand why you're here?

284
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:28,930
知道
Yes.

285
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,460
格拉斯曼医生说我得和你谈谈
Dr. Glassman said I had to talk to you.

286
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,430
任何医生在经历了潜在性的创伤事件之后
After any doctor goes through a potentially traumatic --

287
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,670
你得先确定
You have to determine

288
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:38,170
我是否对医院负有法律责任
if I'm a medicolegal liability to the hospital.

289
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:40,940
没错  而且更重要的是
Yes. And, more importantly,

290
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:43,980
这是一个为你提供情感支持的机会
it's an opportunity to provide you with emotional support.

291
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,470
你感觉如何
How are you feeling?

292
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,030
你这没有苹果
You don't have apples.

293
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,640
下次我们见面的时候我会准备些水果
I'll try to have some fruit next time we meet.

294
00:13:59,240 --> 00:13:59,970
很好
Good.

295
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:05,090
你会为今天早上发生的事情感到后悔吗
Do you regret anything about this morning?

296
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,170
为什么
Why?

297
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,140
在糟糕的事情发生之后
After bad things happen,

298
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,110
反复回想这些事情是很正常的
it's perfectly normal to replay the events,

299
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:13,380
希望自己当时做出了不同的选择
wishing you had done things differently.

300
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,990
事情已经发生了
It already happened.

301
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:17,020
我无力回天
I can't do things differently.

302
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:21,750
我们谈论这件事会让你感到不安吗
Is talking about this upsetting you?

303
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:28,450
你现在在想什么
What are you thinking about right now?

304
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:34,240
全身炎症反应综合征
Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome.

305
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:38,060
手术很顺利
The surgery went well.

306
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,260
经历了像这样的严重创伤后
After a serious trauma like this,

307
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:43,520
机体会产生自我毁灭的炎症反应
the body can develop a self-destructive inflammatory reaction.

308
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:46,390
肾脏  肝脏  肺脏  心脏
Kidneys, liver, lungs, heart --

309
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,720
其中任何一个甚至全部同时开始衰竭
any or all of them can start to shut down.

310
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,460
我们会给她抗炎治疗
We'll be giving her anti-inflammatories

311
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,200
并密切监控
and monitoring her closely,

312
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,790
之后的二十四小时至关重要
but the next 24 hours are critical.

313
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,130
好的  谢谢
Okay. Thanks.

314
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:57,400
让她平安挺过来  无论你们用什么办法
Just get her through this. Whatever you got to do.

315
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,250
好的  我需要你女朋友的亲属
Yeah, well, I need consent forms

316
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,820
来签署知情同意书
from your girlfriend's next of kin.

317
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:02,770
请你把她的亲人带过来
If you could please get her family in here

318
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:04,060
越快越好
as quickly as possible.

319
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,190
我不能  我...
I can't. I...

320
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:15,430
我都不知道她姓什么
I don't even know her last name.

321
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:17,210
这是我们第一次约会
It was our first date.

322
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:18,550
我们在一个约会App上认识的
W-We met on a dating app.

323
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,480
我们要去爬山
We were going hiking,

324
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:22,100
所以她没带钱包和身份证
so she wasn't carrying a purse or ID.

325
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:25,190
好吧  那你不需要待在这
Well, then, you really don't need to be here.

326
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:30,170
这世上有人在乎她
Someone out there cares about her.

327
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:31,090
如果她死了
If she dies,

328
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:33,010
我希望他们知道临死前有人陪着她
I want them to know someone was with her.

329
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:39,120
我会让社工试着联系她的家人
I'll have social work try to locate her family.

330
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,250
你想待多久都可以
Stay as long as you want.

331
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:56,500
看起来干净  干燥  健康
It looks clean, dry, and healthy.

332
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,070
我的脖子快疼死了
My neck is killing me.

333
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,130
滥用药物有多久了
How long have you been using?

334
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,480
有什么关系吗
What's that got to do with anything?

335
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:06,970
你对止痛药已经有一定程度的耐受
Well, you likely built up a tolerance to pain meds.

336
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:08,190
现在你真正需要它们的时候
Now that you really need them,

337
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:08,880
它们就不太管用了
they aren't there for you.

338
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,530
所以我才需要芬太尼
That's why I need fentanyl.

339
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,440
一百毫克  你到底帮不帮我
100 micrograms. Are you gonna help me or not?

340
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,710
这没用的
That wouldn't be helping.

341
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:16,160
我不会纵容你的坏习惯
The worst thing I can do for you is feed your habit.

342
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:19,850
怎么了
What?

343
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:21,750
你看到我的纹身了
You saw my tattoo.

344
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:23,720
没错
Yeah.

345
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,420
你现在在惩罚我
And now you're punishing me.

346
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,490
你想让我忍受疼痛
You want this to hurt.

347
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:27,580
我在专业地对你进行治疗
I'm treating you professionally.

348
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,620
如果你真的是在治疗
If you were treating me professionally,

349
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,130
我就不会这么疼了  对不起  但是我
I wouldn't be in so much pain. I'm sorry, but I --

350
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:31,740
该死的把药给我
Just give me the damn drugs!

351
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,120
快点
Come on!

352
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:52,560
梅伦德斯觉得他负责艾莉的病例没问题
Melendez thinks that he's okay being on Avery's case.

353
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,600
我不这么认为
I don't.

354
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:55,810
梅伦德斯医生或许是对的
Dr. Melendez may be right.

355
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:58,310
这个病例或许眼下是肖恩主要的关注点
That case seems to be Shaun's primary focus right now.

356
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,980
或许他是不幸中的万幸
Maybe his condition is a blessing in this situation.

357
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:01,530
或许
Maybe?

358
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:03,460
也或许执着于艾莉的健康状况
Or obsessing over Avery's health

359
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,680
是宣泄他负罪感的唯一出口
could be his only outlet for a guilty conscience.

360
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,260
看着她饱受痛苦煎熬只会让他感觉更糟
Watching her suffer could just be worsening those feelings.

361
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,410
所以  要不这就是一个大问题
So, either it's a huge problem

362
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:10,710
要不就根本算不上是问题
or it's not a problem at all.

363
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:13,450
这是你的专业意见
This is your professional opinion?

364
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,180
肖恩的思维非常独特
Shaun has a very unique mind

365
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,200
而且性格十分内向
and an incredibly introverted nature.

366
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,740
多谢你的建议
Well, thank you for that.

367
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:25,700
我很抱歉  但是没有和他进一步的接触
I'm sorry, but without a lot more time with him,

368
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,230
我只能提供这些建议
that's the best I can offer.

369
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:37,370
利姆到底想让我做什么
What did Lim expect me to do --

370
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:38,320
当她质疑我医疗决策的时候
stand there and smile

371
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,540
站在那里面带微笑
while she called my medical judgment into question?

372
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:43,320
干等在手术室里看着病人奄奄一息是吗
Your patient nearly died waiting on that O.R., right?

373
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,740
太糟糕了  你到底想让我做什么
It was bad. What do you want me to do?

374
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,140
让她别折磨我了
Tell her to back off!

375
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,730
-不要  -他就是个十足的
- No. - He's a complete and utter --

376
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,240
哪有温柔善良的种族歧视者
Not one of those nice racists, huh?

377
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,960
-我本不应该  -克莱尔
- I shouldn't have to be -- Claire!

378
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,880
你要做的就是
Here's what you have to do --

379
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,990
闭上嘴然后按照利姆医生说的做
shut up and do exactly what Dr. Lim tells you to do.

380
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:55,720
可是
But --

381
00:17:58,290 --> 00:17:59,020
好的
Yes, sir.

382
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,440
或许我们可以轮换
Maybe we could take turns.

383
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,000
你帮我照看我的患者
You can keep an eye on my patient,

384
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,170
我照看你的
I keep an eye on yours.

385
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:15,930
不
No.

386
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,190
她的肌酐是1.6
Her creatinine is 1.6.

387
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,900
受了她这么严重的伤
Mild bump in renal numbers

388
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,110
肾脏指标轻微升高并不奇怪
isn't surprising after all her trauma.

389
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,010
今天早上肯定很糟糕
This morning must've been crazy.

390
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,110
你没事吧
Are you okay?

391
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:40,790
今天早上  我邻居莉亚过来吃掉了我的苹果
This morning, my neighbor Lea came over and ate my apple.

392
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,220
那太糟糕了
That's too bad.

393
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,800
没错  那是我最后一个苹果
Yes, it was my last one.

394
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,050
她很生我们的房东阿尔蒙的气
She was upset with Armen, our landlord.

395
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:50,290
她放音乐很大声
She plays her music very loud.

396
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,730
我给了她一些建议  似乎把她惹恼了
I gave her some advice. It seemed to anger her

397
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:54,850
因为她走的时候没说再见
because she left without saying goodbye.

398
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:58,090
你觉得是你做错了
And you think you did something wrong.

399
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:01,160
不  那是很好的建议
No, it was good advice.

400
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:05,250
肖恩  有时候女人想要的是建议
Shaun, sometimes a woman wants advice,

401
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,350
有时候她是想向你寻求支持
and sometimes she just wants support.

402
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,770
我怎么知道莉亚想要哪个
How can I tell which one Lea wants?

403
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:15,200
支持她总不为过
Err on the side of support.

404
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,000
-并没帮到她  -帮到了
- That's not helpful. - Yes, it is.

405
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,170
布朗医生  病人呼叫你
Dr. Browne. You're being summoned.

406
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:23,850
好吧
All right.

407
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:28,750
到时间了
About time.

408
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:34,360
你费劲挣扎  静脉注射针管都弄掉了
All your struggling, you've pulled out your IV.

409
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,850
这些破活难道通常不是护士在做吗
Aren't nurses usually supposed to do this kind of crap?

410
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:43,270
他们让你念医学院
They let you go to med school,

411
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:45,590
却不敢把真正重要的活托付给你
but they don't trust you with any real responsibility.

412
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:49,070
医院肯定有某个有能力的医生
There must be a competent doctor tucked around here somewhere

413
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:51,570
可以跟谁说我需要的不只是阿司匹林
who tell someone I need more than aspirin.

414
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,500
-「有能力」  -对
- "Competent"? - Yeah.

415
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,710
你懂我的意思
You know what I mean.

416
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:59,990
{\an8}古埃及的神  被认为是神和人共同的医生

417
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:59,990
伊姆霍特普是现代医学之父
Imhotep was the father of modern medicine.

418
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,610
-埃及人  -是啊
- An Egyptian. - Yeah.

419
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:03,080
给你们的种族长脸了
Good for your people.

420
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:06,520
我相信过去三千多年来你们的种族
I'm willing to bet there's even been a couple others

421
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:09,820
甚至出过好几个厉害人物  但猜猜看
over the last 3,000 years, but guess what?

422
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:11,070
一般来说
On average,

423
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,260
世上大多数伟大的科技进步
you look at most great technological advancements,

424
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:16,500
都由骄傲的北欧人民持有专利
you'll find a proud Northern European holding the patent.

425
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,910
这就是你今天上午在忙活的事吗
That's what you were trying to do this morning?

426
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,720
忙着获得从街角商店偷三十块钱
Get the patent on stealing 30 bucks

427
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,720
去买毒品的专利吗
from the corner store for a drug fix?

428
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,290
你不喜欢瘾君子吧
You don't like drug addicts, do you?

429
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:30,040
我有很多不喜欢的人
A lot of people I don't like.

430
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:34,330
小偷  种族歧视者
Thieves, racists, 

431
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,210
暴力流氓
violent punks,

432
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:37,330
但我还是会治疗他们
but I'll treat 'em.

433
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,590
你老妈是瘾君子吗
Was your mama a drug addict?

434
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:46,340
老话题的美妙之处
That's the beauty of cliches,

435
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,160
就在于通常都是真的  对吧
is they're true so often, huh?

436
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,690
你对我一无所知
You don't know anything about me.

437
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,100
我没念大学
I didn't go to college.

438
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,980
我没有平权运动特别照顾  所以没念
I didn't have no affirmative action to get me in,

439
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:57,070
但你有
but you did.

440
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:00,100
就因为某个软心肠的自由党人在院长办公室
All because some bleeding-heart liberal in the Dean's office

441
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,930
哭着读你写的有关嗑药贱人老妈的文章
teared up reading your essay about your crack-whore mama.

442
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,300
搞什么
What the hell?

443
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,430
看来我们都是暴力流氓
I guess we're all violent punks.

444
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,320
你当时只需把钱包给他
All you had to do was give him your wallet.

445
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,450
她的尿量很少
Her urine output is low.

446
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:50,910
你在干什么
What are you doing?!

447
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:52,020
别碰她
Get away from her!

448
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,870
你别在这推搡医生
You can't be in here shoving my doctors around.

449
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:55,610
我  他  他才是...
Me? He -- He's the --

450
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:00,160
-天啊  -她得做血液透析
- Oh, my God. - She needs dialysis.

451
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,390
她的肾脏衰竭得很快
Her kidneys are failing fast.

452
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:05,930
这是器官完全衰竭的第一阶段
This is the first stage of total organ failure.

453
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,820
血液透析已排出了两升的过量液体
We removed two liters of excess fluid with dialysis,

454
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,310
但她情况在恶化
but she's getting worse.

455
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:19,310
她的胸腔有积液
Fluid's building up in her chest.

456
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:20,810
她的肺也衰竭了
She's in pulmonary failure, too.

457
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:22,440
排出她胸腔的积液
Draining the fluid in her pleural space

458
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,220
可以减少气道阻力
would reduce airway resistance.

459
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,220
好  准备给她做胸腔穿刺术
Yeah, let's prep her for a thoracentesis.

460
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:28,500
动作得快
We're gonna have to work fast.

461
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,360
我去准备胸腔引流
I'll prep the evac drain.

462
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,410
你得把针放到...
I'm gonna need you to put that needle right between --

463
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:33,770
第六和第七根肋骨间
6th and 7th rib.

464
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,310
你要让他动手...
Wait, you're gonna let him do --

465
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,940
闭嘴  好  小心
Shut up. All right, careful.

466
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,280
别把针插得太深
Don't put the needle in too deep.

467
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,550
-不能让她...  -气胸
- We don't want to give her -- - Pneumothorax.

468
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,200
好  进去了
All right, you're in.

469
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:57,100
看看引出了什么
Now, let me see what I can pull out.

470
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,900
但愿她的情况能稳定
Hopefully she settles down.

471
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:18,340
二氧化碳降了  氧气升了
CO2's down, and O2's climbing.

472
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,150
我们能稳住她的肾脏和肺部
We can manage her kidneys and her lungs,

473
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,980
多个器官衰竭的最后一步就是心脏衰竭
but the last stop in multiple organ failure would be her heart.

474
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:27,240
全神贯注她的呼吸压力
Watch her ventilation pressures like a hawk,

475
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,660
注入心脏保护药物
push cardioprotective meds, 

476
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:31,080
情况有变就呼叫我
and page me if anything changes.

477
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:34,790
你以为你是她的英雄吗
Think you're being her hero?

478
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,320
事实上你几乎不懂她
The fact is you hardly know her.

479
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:38,930
你也根本不懂他
And you don't know him at all.

480
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:41,080
回家吧
Go home.

481
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,010
我受够了
Okay, I am done.

482
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,680
他是个满嘴污言秽语的恶毒混球
He's a foul-mouthed, spiteful bully.

483
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,280
没问题  我会让接待员
No problem. I'll have the concierge

484
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,640
给你找个更对你胃口的病患
find a patient more suited to your liking.

485
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:07,330
他不需要医生去照顾他
He doesn't need a doctor doting over him.

486
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:09,030
他不想看到我
He doesn't want me.

487
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,390
我不管
I don't care.

488
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:13,980
抱歉我之前顶撞了你
I'm sorry I disagreed with you, okay?

489
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:17,590
但我不该像个学生妹那样被人奚落
But I don't deserve to be scolded like a school girl

490
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,730
就因为你自负之心受不了半点顶撞
because your ego can't handle being challenged a little.

491
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:23,260
这道歉可真有意思
That is some apology.

492
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:24,420
我有正当理由...
Look, I had a legitimate --

493
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,960
你真没意识到问题所在吗
You really don't see the problem here?

494
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,080
什么  顶撞你吗
What? With challenging you?

495
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:33,990
你现在是当着两个护士的面顶撞我
Right now, you are confronting me in front of two nurses.

496
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:35,950
你敢这样对梅伦德斯吗
Would you do that to Melendez?

497
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,890
或者你会等五分钟吗
Or would you wait five minutes?

498
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:45,140
我整个职业生涯都在跟不服我领导的男人打交道
I have dealt with men undermining my authority my entire career.

499
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:47,470
女人何必为难女人
We shouldn't do it to one another, too.

500
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,520
现在就像照顾其他病患一样去照顾他
Now go take care of him like you would any other patient.

501
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:04,980
所有订单餐厅都会复查
Food services -- they double-check every order.

502
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:05,980
你在找什么
What are you looking for?

503
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,440
-一个苹果  -一个苹果
- An apple. - An apple?

504
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,710
-谁会点一个苹果  -我
- Who's getting an apple? - I am!

505
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:10,010
-不  -肖恩
- No. - Shaun.

506
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:11,430
请别管苹果了
Forget the apple, please.

507
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:13,120
抱歉  能单独聊聊吗
I'm sorry. Can I have a minute?

508
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,070
肖恩
Shaun?

509
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:17,470
好吧
Okay.

510
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:24,940
肖恩  防卫心别那么强  好吗
Shaun, there's no need to get defensive, okay?

511
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:25,720
你要坐下来吗
Do you want to sit down?

512
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,830
不  谢了
No, thank you.

513
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,450
我要你再跟我说一遍
I want you to tell me again

514
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,420
今早发生的事
exactly what happened this morning.

515
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,490
我跟你说了今早发生的事
I told you exactly what happened this morning.

516
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:37,730
是的  但人们告诉你是你的错
Yes, but people have told you that it's your fault.

517
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:38,360
不是吗
Haven't they?

518
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:42,070
我的行动跟枪击是关联事件
My actions and the shooting were associative incidents.

519
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:43,890
而不是因果关系
It is not a causal relationship.

520
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:45,380
我踱步  她中枪
I paced, and she got shot,

521
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,640
但枪击不是踱步引起的
but pacing doesn't cause shootings,

522
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,980
否则每次有人踱步
otherwise every time someone paced,

523
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,880
很快就会接着发生枪击
a shooting would soon follow.

524
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:52,000
好吧  你说得非常好
Okay, that's a very good point.

525
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:56,760
有人持枪
When someone has a gun

526
00:25:57,050 --> 00:26:00,230
是危险的情况  对吗
and it's a dangerous situation, right?

527
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,630
你不想扰乱这种情况  对吗
You don't want to upset the situation.

528
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,450
你不想把情况变糟
You don't want to make it worse.

529
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,390
你也认为这是我的错
You think this is my fault, too.

530
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:10,140
不是  那是枪...
No, no, it was the shoot--

531
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:12,360
那是枪手的错
It was the shooter's fault,

532
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:16,000
但你的行动可能造成了影响
but your actions may have contributed to it.

533
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,160
好吧  肖恩  等一下  等一下
Okay, Shaun, wait a second. Wait a second.

534
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,690
我知道你无法完全控制你的行为
I know your behavior is not completely in your control,

535
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:24,690
但我也知道你不是完全无法控制你的行为
but I also know it's not completely out of your control.

536
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:25,710
对吗
Is it?

537
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:29,140
所以  也许你有一点责任
So, yes, maybe it is a little bit your fault.

538
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,850
我也当然有责任
And definitely mine.

539
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:36,020
你甚至不在场
You weren't even there.

540
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,930
没错
That's right.

541
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:40,550
我不在场
I wasn't there.

542
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,160
我们能坐下聊吗  就一会儿
Can we sit down, please, just for a second?

543
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,400
肖恩
Shaun...

544
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:57,050
我说服自己一切都没问题
I convinced myself that everything was fine

545
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:59,390
因为在这里确实是那样
because in here, it is.

546
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:00,510
挺棒的
It's great.

547
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,860
但你需要帮助
But you need help.

548
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:04,990
肖恩
Shaun...

549
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,740
你需要引导
you need guidance --

550
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,260
远不止我所能给予你的
much more than I can give you.

551
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:18,240
我该跟我的病患待在一起
I'm supposed to be with my patient.

552
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,640
我该全神贯注地看着她
I'm supposed to be watching her like a hawk.

553
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,020
是我的错
It's my fault.

554
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:50,020
我不喜欢她
I didn't like her.

555
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:52,510
我今早一看见她时  她...
When I first saw her this morning, she just...

556
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:55,060
看起来不...
didn't look...

557
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:57,400
我不知道
I don't know.

558
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:05,930
我想放她鸽子
I mean, I wanted to blow her off,

559
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:09,350
所以我说我忘了带水
so, uh... I said I forgot water.

560
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:11,280
我设想我们去商店买时
I mean, I figured we'd go to the store

561
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,140
我假装我忘了带钱包
and -- and I'd pretend that I forgot my wallet.

562
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:15,340
我知道她没有带钱包  所以...
I knew she didn't have her purse, so...

563
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,470
没有水  我们就不能去远足了  对吗
We can't go hiking without water, right?

564
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:20,800
这样就无害不罚了
I mean, no harm, no foul?

565
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:26,980
因为我她才会去那
She was there because of me.

566
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,270
她会在这...
She's here...

567
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,690
是因为我
because of me.

568
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:37,250
这不是因果关系
It's not a causal relationship.

569
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:40,620
慢着  你说什么
Wait, excuse me?

570
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,880
这不是因果关系
It's not a causal relationship --

571
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,030
说谎和枪击
lying and shootings.

572
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:48,210
说谎不会引起枪击
Lying doesn't cause shootings,

573
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:50,250
否则  每次有人说谎...
otherwise, every time someone lied --

574
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,970
她的脉压变低了
Her pulse pressure is narrow.

575
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:54,470
慢着  那是什么意思
Wait, what does that mean?

576
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:56,130
她快死了
She's dying.

577
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:58,210
马上呼叫梅伦德斯
Page Melendez. Stat!

578
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:07,360
你的呼吸率上升了
Your respiratory rate is up.

579
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,760
你呼吸有困难吗
Are you having trouble breathing?

580
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,580
是的  很紧密
Yeah. It's tight.

581
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:19,710
找利姆医生
Find Dr. Lim.

582
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,700
脉压变低表示心排血量减少
Narrow pulse pressure indicates a reduced cardiac output.

583
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,610
炎症在影响她的心脏
The inflammation is affecting her heart.

584
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:28,030
她处于器官衰竭末期
She's in end-stage organ failure.

585
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:30,000
是的  我们可以插入主动脉内球囊反搏
Yes, we can insert an intra-aortic balloon pump.

586
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,510
也许能减轻她心脏的工作量
It may reduce some of the workload on her heart,

587
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:34,160
但衰竭得很快  非常快
but it's failing fast -- really fast.

588
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,600
只需要撑过一夜
It only needs to work overnight.

589
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:37,480
之后炎症反应会改善
The inflammatory reaction will improve after that.

590
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:40,230
如果衰竭得那么快不是因为她的心脏呢
What if it's failing so fast because it's not her heart?

591
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:43,030
最近两次检测
Her hemoglobin's dropped from 14 to 12

592
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,200
她的血红蛋白值从14降到了12
between her last two draws.

593
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,020
如果她是因为某处有出血呢
What if the real problem is she's bleeding somewhere?

594
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:46,960
鉴于她的病情
Given what she's been through,

595
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,270
下降两点也许没什么
a two-point drop could mean nothing.

596
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:49,780
也有可能代表有出血状况
Or it could mean a bleed,

597
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,590
这样也能说明脉压为何会降低
which would account for the narrow pulse pressure.

598
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:52,860
她的心脏也会没事了
Her heart could be fine.

599
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:56,350
如果你说得对  我们得再给她开刀
If you're right, that means we'd have to open her back up.

600
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:58,300
我不确定她的身体是否能够承受第二次手术
I don't know if her body can handle another operation.

601
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,440
是的  承受不了
No, it can't.

602
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,340
通过主动脉内球囊泵治疗心脏衰竭
Treating heart failure with an aortic pump

603
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:03,400
也是比较简单的手术
is also a simple procedure.

604
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:06,530
所以咱们现在要根据手术难易度来下诊断了吗
So we're going to diagnose based on which procedure is simpler?

605
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:08,750
如果我的猜测没错  她泵不出足量的血
If I'm right, there could be no more blood to pump.

606
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:09,900
她会死的
She'll be dead.

607
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,320
她快不行了
She's crashing!

608
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:16,160
我们可以准备介入以进行泵血
We should prepare the cath lab for a pump.

609
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,690
准备手术室吧
We should prepare the O.R.

610
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:23,790
赶紧推她进手术室
Let's get her into an O.R. Now.

611
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:35,460
血红蛋白降到8了
Hemoglobin's dropped to 8.

612
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:37,940
她大出血了
She is bleeding out.

613
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:39,360
是的  但出血点在哪儿
Yes, she is, but where?

614
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,790
赶紧找到出血点
Got to find where the bleeder's coming from

615
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:42,690
在她死前钳住出血点
and clip it before she dies.

616
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:44,590
我没找到
I got nothing.

617
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:47,300
肯定是藏在腹膜后腔或纵膈后面了
Must be hidden under the retroperitoneum or mediastinum.

618
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,290
开刀的这块区域很大
That's a whole lot of real estate

619
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:49,960
只能盲目地探寻了
to cut open and just go blindly looking.

620
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,050
先从腹腔开始吧  她的枪伤在那里
We should start at the abdomen. She was shot there.

621
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,610
子弹贯穿了胸腔
The bullet passed through the posterior thorax.

622
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:55,830
收缩压40  舒张压无  她快死了  尼尔
BP's 40 over palp. She's dying, Neil.

623
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,660
无论你要做什么  赶紧动手
Whatever you're gonna do, you need to do it now.

624
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:58,610
那就到处都查一下吧
We need to look everywhere. 

625
00:30:58,610 --> 00:30:59,710
请给我一把手术刀和胸骨锯
Give me a knife and sternal saw.

626
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:01,750
我要给她开腹  从胸腔直到骨盆
I'm gonna open her up from chest to pelvis.

627
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:04,980
给胸骨和腹部碘伏消毒
Prep the sternum and abdomen with Betadine.

628
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,090
我需要一把海绵钳
Gonna need a sponge stick

629
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:08,950
在找到出血点时以便控制
to control the bleeding when we find it.

630
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:20,040
住手
Stop!

631
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,580
从她左侧第二根和第三根肋骨那里下刀
Open her between the second and third rib on the left side.

632
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,350
子弹划破了左侧肋间最上动脉
The bullet nicked the left supreme intercostal artery.

633
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,550
动脉壁破裂
The wall has blown.

634
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:31,560
你怎么知道
How do you know?

635
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,790
根据伤口...
I followed the injuries --

636
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:35,870
从骨盆  肠道  脾脏到隔膜
pelvis to bowel to spleen to diaphragm.

637
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:39,700
下一个创口就该是左侧肋间最上动脉
Next target has to be left supreme intercostal artery.

638
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,370
给左侧肋间做术前消毒
All right, prep left intercostal space.

639
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,020
我喘不过气
I can't breathe.

640
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,610
为什么你们不帮帮我
Why aren't you helping me?

641
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:54,080
利姆医生两分钟内就会过来
Dr. Lim will be along in just two minutes.

642
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,360
你是医生  赶紧救命啊
You're the damn doctor. Do your job.

643
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:09,800
我需要打开左侧颈部筋膜间隙
I need to open up the left neck compartment

644
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:11,240
释放压力
to relieve the pressure.

645
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:12,380
手术包
Procedure tray?

646
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,750
你以前做过吗
You done this before?

647
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:21,960
没有
Nope.

648
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:23,220
手术刀
Scalpel.

649
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,640
肿胀太厉害
It's too swollen.

650
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,520
我看不到喉结
I can't see the Adam's apple.

651
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:34,810
好了
Okay.

652
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:39,480
沿着颈动脉鞘和气管之间的软凹陷切开
Cut along the soft divot between the carotid sheath and the trachea.

653
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,730
软凹陷
Soft divot.

654
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:41,780
找到了
Got it.

655
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:57,670
什么情况
Update me.

656
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:00,700
你做了什么
What did you do?

657
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,150
他的颈部有血肿
He had a cervical hematoma. 

658
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:02,950
我得释放压力
I had to relieve the pressure.

659
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,900
这里吗
Here?

660
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,870
氧饱和回升了
Oxygen sats are going up.

661
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:14,220
这很少见  但术后肿胀会伴随气管破烂
It's rare, but post-op swelling can happen with tracheal tears.

662
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:17,150
所以我们才会在术后24小时内严密观察患者
That's why we watch them so closely the first 24 hours.

663
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:19,560
让我们到手术室完成这个好吗
You mind if we finish this off in the operating room?

664
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:25,340
我什么都没看到  肖恩
I don't see anything, Shaun --

665
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:27,040
没有出血  也没有动脉破裂
no blood and no arterial tear.

666
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,070
你找到位置太高
You're too high.

667
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:29,970
就在分叉附近
It's near the bifurcation.

668
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:31,050
打灯
Get some light in.

669
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:37,160
我找到了
I got something. 

670
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,720
分叉右下方有血涌出
Blood's pooling right under the bifurcation.

671
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:39,790
给我止血钳
Clamp now.

672
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:58,360
她不再心脏衰竭了
She wasn't in heart failure.

673
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,560
这意味着她的心脏足够强壮
That means her heart is still strong enough

674
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,880
能帮她度过这一晚
to get her through the night.

675
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:03,190
我错了
I was wrong.

676
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:05,430
没错
Yeah.

677
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:06,940
但你刚刚已经弥补了错误
And you just made up for it.

678
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,470
你说得对  杰瑞德
You were right, Jared.

679
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:16,970
干得好
Good work.

680
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:44,550
你知道吗
You know what?

681
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,890
你说得对
You were right.

682
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,050
我妈妈是有问题
My mother had problems.

683
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,020
所以我无法忍受只是袖手旁观
So I couldn't afford to just around

684
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,930
希望天上掉大饼
expecting everything to be handed to me

685
00:34:51,930 --> 00:34:55,410
或是其他拖我后腿的事情
or whatever else it is that's holding you back.

686
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,190
是的  我取得了一些成就
And yeah, I got some breaks,

687
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:58,680
但我也拼了命
but I worked my ass off.

688
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:02,400
两份工作  两个室友  一步步一路走来
Two jobs, two roommates every step of the way.

689
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:05,840
靠着这些  我才能站在这个位置拯救你的性命
And that is what got me to the place where I could save your life.

690
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:22,490
你女儿尚未脱离危险
Your daughter's not out of the woods yet,

691
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:25,620
但我认为她的状况会一天天转好
but I do expect her condition to improve day by day.

692
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:27,660
谢谢你  医生
Thank you, Doctor.

693
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:28,930
-谢谢  -客气

宝贝
Baby.

00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:48,610
抱歉我们没陪在你身边
Sorry we weren't here for you.

696
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:49,790
你感觉怎么样
How are you feeling?

697
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:54,020
暂时没办法去爬山了
Probably won't be hiking anytime soon.

698
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,330
我还没谢你呢  你就想偷偷溜走吗
You sneaking out before I can thank you?

699
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:06,860
不是  你没必要谢我的
Please, you don't need to thank me.

700
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,750
不  有必要
Yeah, I do.

701
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,430
还有道歉
And apologize.

702
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:15,650
我之前误会了你
I was wrong about you.

703
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:21,460
我以为你要抛弃我
I thought you were trying to ditch me.

704
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:25,950
我当时...
I was...

705
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:29,400
希望你抛弃我
hoping you were trying to ditch me.

706
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:34,920
对不起
I'm sorry.

707
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:40,290
等你感觉好点
When you're feeling better,

708
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:42,840
我希望我们能再来一次初次约会
I'd like a second chance at a first date.

709
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:03,980
抱歉
I'm sorry.

710
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:09,050
你是对的
You were right.

711
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:11,610
我公然对你不敬
I publicly disrespected you,

712
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:15,190
所以我只能公然对你表示敬重以弥补错误
and so I thought it only right to publicly respect you.

713
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:22,440
我很感激从你这里学到的教训
I am grateful for the chance to learn from you.

714
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:27,070
我知道你需要这场胜利
I know you needed this victory.

715
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:29,160
很高兴你今天拯救了性命
Glad you saved a life today.

716
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:32,120
希望他不是纳粹
Just wish it wasn't a Nazi.

717
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:04,240
2号跑道
Lane number two.

718
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,780
曼蒂经常跑那条跑道
Maddie always took that lane.

719
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,330
她会一直缀在我后面跑
She would tuck in behind me

720
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:13,080
直到最后200米才会超越我
and draft until the last 200 meters.

721
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:15,490
一个见不得人的小把戏
It was a dirty little trick.

722
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:19,050
-但很有效  -每次都有效
- It worked. - Every time.

723
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:27,070
至今都13年了
13 years ago today.

724
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:29,500
是啊
Yeah.

725
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:31,690
我也很想她
I miss her, too.

726
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,720
给她一些空间吧
Give her space, right?

727
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,010
给她一些空间
Give her space.

728
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,440
她只是在渐渐远离
She just drifted farther and farther away.

729
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,950
我做的所有事...
Everything I did...

730
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:47,130
都做错了
I did wrong.

731
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:49,520
你尽了力
You did your best.

732
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:52,850
我当时
I was...

733
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:58,230
几乎就是住在你家了
practically living at your house back then, and --

734
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,440
如果我没有...
If I hadn't...

735
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:04,880
你们俩当时都是青少年
You were both teenagers.

736
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,400
都一样的中二
You were idiots.

737
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:09,270
你走了好运  她没有
You got lucky, she didn't.

738
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,150
如果我...
If I...

739
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,890
能多陪陪她...
was there more...

740
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:19,310
如果我
if I...

741
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,660
在她身边...
stayed on her...

742
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,330
你当时在他身边
You're there for him.

743
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:37,200
以下是本周的天气预报
Here's your extended forecast for the week.

744
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,890
首先旧金山多云
Starting off with a little bit of cloud cover in San Francisco, 

745
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:41,440
气温降至21度...
temperatures in the low 70s...

746
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:44,070
到了周末只有几度
...just a few degrees as we get closer to the weekend.

747
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:46,860
希望未来7天能天晴干燥
Expect dry conditions for the next seven days here --

748
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,690
我看到你家有灯
I, uh, saw your light.

749
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:58,360
对不起
I'm sorry.

750
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:02,310
克莱尔说我要道歉
Claire told me to apologize

751
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:04,420
因为你并不希望我说实话
because you didn't want me to tell the truth.

752
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:06,800
你只是希望我能支持你的观点
You only wanted me to support your position,

753
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,240
即便你是错的
even though it's wrong.

754
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:13,330
我不接受你的道歉
Well, I don't accept.

755
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:19,520
今早我也许有点反应过度
I may have overreacted this morning a little.

756
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:23,180
你很诚实  极其诚实
And you were honest -- brutally honest --

757
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:26,820
但你在自己家不应该戴耳塞
but you shouldn't have to wear ear plugs in your own home.

758
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,500
别为了让我好受而说谎
And don't start lying to me to make me feel good.

759
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:34,780
你是我认识的唯一诚实的人
You're the only honest guy I know.

760
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:38,830
所以...
So...

761
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,360
晚安  肖恩·莫菲
...have a good night, Shaun Murphy.

762
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:47,230
我会努力不吵醒你
And I will try not to keep you up.

763
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:57,990
