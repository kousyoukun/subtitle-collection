1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:02,730
圣何塞圣文德医院

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:04,620
好消息  有位贵宾病患需要在手肘
Good news. I have a VIP who needs a multiple ligament

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,000
做多处韧带重建术
reconstruction on his elbow,

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,770
我有两个协助我和梅伦德斯医生的住院医名额
and I've got room for a couple residents to assist me and Dr. Melendez.

5
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:10,600
太棒了
Awesome.

6
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,390
我之前从没协助过这种手术
I've never assisted on one of those before.

7
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:14,510
安德鲁斯医生清楚
Dr. Andrews knows that.

8
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:16,050
所以他才用圣诞节清晨的语气宣布消息
That's why he's acting like it's Christmas morning.

9
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:18,880
我猜你也没给职业运动员做过手术
I'm guessing you've never operated on a pro athlete, either.

10
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:20,590
据我所知
Um, last time I checked,

11
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:23,050
你说的是两个名额  但我们有三人
a "Couple" means "Two," and there's three of us.

12
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:24,510
还有个好消息
More good news.

13
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,950
剩下那名住院医师将协助科利医生
Whoever isn't with us will be assisting Dr. Coyle

14
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:30,040
做双腿筋膜切开术
on a double-leg fasciotomy.

15
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:32,330
试试手气
Feeling lucky?

16
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:35,050
莫菲
Murphy.

17
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:39,160

Fasciotomy.

19
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:48,030
博比·奥托  我好像没听说过
Bobby Ato? Don't think I've heard of him.

20
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:49,310
他是职业运动员吗
He's a pro athlete?

21
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:51,110
是职业的  但不知道算不算运动员
He's a pro. I don't know if I'd call him in athlete.

22
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:52,190
电子运动
E-sports.

23
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:54,260
电子游戏吗
Video games?

24
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:55,240
他是世上首屈一指的玩家
He's one of the best in the world.

25
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,480
去年他获得的奖金
Last year, he won enough prize money

26
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,550
都够给他妈妈在蒙特雷买幢沙滩别墅了
to buy his mom a beach house in Monterey.

27
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,050
还是现金支付
Paid cash.

28
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:02,820
他被列为贵宾病患
Is he considered a very important person

29
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,900
是因为他是运动员还是因为他很有钱
because he's an athlete or because he has a lot of money?

30
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:06,760
-都是  -都是
- Both. - Both.

31
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,890
我得走了
I have to go.

32
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,090
早上好  肖恩
Morning, Shaun.

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,760
这位是梅丽莎·伯恩
This is Melissa Bourne,

34
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,080
我跟你提过的那位治疗师
the therapist that we talked about.

35
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:35,500
你答应和她见面了的  肖恩
That you agreed to meet with, right, Shaun?

36
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,250
你好  肖恩  很高兴见到你
Hi, Shaun. It's nice to meet you.

00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,260
你好
H-H-Hi.

38
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:42,280
格拉斯曼医生觉得在第一次上门治疗前
Dr. Glassman thought it would be a good idea for us to meet

39
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,230
我们最好见一面
before our first in-home session.

40
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:46,000
好让你感到自在些
Just to make sure you're comfortable.

41
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,540
我不自在
I am not comfortable.

42
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:48,610
肖恩
Shaun.

43
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,220
没事的
It's gonna be fine.

44
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,210
你们会喜欢彼此的
You two are going to like each other.

45
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:56,740
伯恩医生是认知心理学的博士
Dr. Bourne has a PhD in cognitive psychology.

46
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:59,710
她真的能帮到你  只要你给她个机会
She can really help you, but you have to give her a chance.

47
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:04,340
好吗
Okay?

48
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,840

注意零度分离

显示外侧副韧带和尺侧副韧带完全撕裂
It's indicative of complete tears of the LCL and the UCL.

55
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,090
完全应该动手术

56
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,990
你妈妈怎么样  还在抗癌吗
How's your mom? Still beating cancer?

57
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,420
她很好  哥们儿
She's good, bro.

58
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,300
她说自从你给她做了乳房重建后
She said she gets checked out at the beach all the time

59
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,200
她在沙滩上总能收获很多目光
ever since you did her breast reconstruction.

60
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,710
所以谢谢你咯
So, uh, thanks. I guess.

61
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,610
我们会治好你的
We're gonna take good care of you.

62
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,390
-手术室见  -谢谢
- See you in the O.R. - Thank you.

63
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:01,980
尺侧副韧带哪一部分是过度外翻动作的
Which part of the UCL is the principal secondary

64
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,320
主要辅助约束

00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,150
-前部  -还好吗
- Anterior. - Everything okay?

66

左手存在反常的握力缺失现象
There is a paradoxical loss of grip strength on the left.

71
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,360
有很多可能的原因
There are many possible explanations for that,

72
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:47,380
-其中之一...  -其中之一是...

他的左臂韧带撕裂
he has ligament tears in his left arm.

74
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,150
麻醉师很快就来
The anesthesiologist will be up in a few

75
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,550
帮你做术前准备
to get you ready for surgery.

76

好极了  谢谢

77
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:01,860
莫菲医生
Dr. Murphy.

78
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,040
-你怎么了  -没事
- What's wrong with you? - N-nothing.

79
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,650
我的情况是...
I have a condition called --

80
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,830
你有自闭症  对对  我知道
You're autistic. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Mm, I get it.

81
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:12,480
但你到底怎么了  哥们儿
But what is wrong with you, bro?

82
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:16,020
你该像个外科医生那样大显身手
You gotta be legit smart to land a gig as a surgeon

83
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:19,870
却被他像对待菜鸟医生一样否定了
and he just shut you down like a noob.

84
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,990
我会再次提出我的想法  我会的
I'll bring the idea up again. I do that.

85
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,280
他们不尊重你
They don't respect you.

86
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,980
他们一开始就该听你说完
And they should listen to you the first time.

87
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,810
-我没法控制他们的行为  -你当然能
- I can't control what they do. - Of course you can.

88
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,290
这就是打游戏的关键
That's what playing the game is all about.

89
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:35,050
就在于控制敌方
It's about controlling your opponent.

90
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,770
你得找到合适的策略
You gotta find the right strategy.

91
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:38,050
这不是游戏
It is not a game.

92
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:40,730
一切都是游戏  兄弟  一切都是游戏
Everything's a game, man. Everything's a game.

93
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,420
只是有时赌注要大一些
Just sometimes the stakes are higher,

94
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,890
而这次的赌注是我的手臂
and this time it's my arm.

95
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,230
看来是你抽到了下下签
So, I'm guessing you drew the short straw.

96
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,460
-你说什么  -你在这
- I beg your pardon? - Well, you're here

97
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,810
而你的住院医师同事们在跟进贵宾病例
and your co-residents are on the VIP case.

98
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,710
我很厉害  但我还是更想跟梅伦德斯和安德鲁斯
I'm awesome and I'd still rather be with Melendez and Andrews.

99
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,830
-不  没事  -别激动  没事的
- No, it's fine -- - Relax. It's cool.

100
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,330
跟我说说病患情况
Tell me about our patient.

101
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:08,400
34岁  女性  软件工程师  企业家
Uh, 34-year-old female, software engineer and entrepreneur

102
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,440
在单车课上因用力过猛导致了骨筋膜室综合征
presenting with Compartment Syndrome caused by extreme overexertion at a spin class.

103
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,420
导致她的腿部肌肉...
The condition has caused the muscles in her legs to --

104
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,470
-很好  -我还没说完
- Okay. Great. - I wasn't finished.

105
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,630
足够体现你的聪明和仔细了
Finished enough to show me you're smart and thorough.

106
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,690
知道治疗方案了吗
You know the treatment plan?

107
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:21,440
-需要切口...  -很好
- We need to make incisions on -- - Good.

108
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,350
你带头
You take lead.

109
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,860
我们要在每条腿的两侧
We need to make a number of long incisions

110
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,980
切开几处切口以缓解压力
down both sides of each leg to relieve the tension

111
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,970
并恢复正常血液循环
and return healthy circulation.

112
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:42,180
重要的是得赶紧手术
It's important we act quickly.

113
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,200
如果没控制住肿胀
If we don't get the swelling under control,

114
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,090
损伤将无法挽回
the damage could be irreparable.

115
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:48,730
什么意思  我需要截肢吗
What does that mean? I could lose my legs?

116
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:50,780
就因为单车课上用力过猛了
From working out too hard in a spin class?

117
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,960
别担心  你姐姐不会有事的
No, don't worry. Your sister's gonna be just fine.

118
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,250
我很确信发现得很及时
Look, I'm very confident we caught this in time.

119
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,410
麻烦向前趴一下
If you could lean forward?

120
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:00,980
我得检查你的肾脏没受影响
I just need to check your kidneys haven't been affected.

121
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:03,250
如果有触痛请告诉我
Let me know if you have any tenderness.

122
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,540
现在取出掌肌
Extracting the palmaris now.

123
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:24,460
安德鲁斯医生  我看了你在《激流新闻》的评论
Dr. Andrews, I read your op-ed in Gen Surge News.

124
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,630
文章很出色
Brilliant piece.

125
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:28,550
从没想到持续护理不足
Never realized the lack of continuity of care

126
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,050
是如此严重的问题
was such a severe problem.

127
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,020
梅伦德斯医生
Dr. Melendez...

128
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,790
你的头发很漂亮
you have very beautiful hair.

129
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:39,220
谢谢
Thank you.

130
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:41,540
鉴于病患的握力缺失情况
Given the patient's grip weakness,

131
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,720
我们可以做一个神经传导实验
we could do a nerve conduction test

132
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,910
以排除任何并发的神经损害
to rule out any concurrent nerve damage.

133
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:46,640
不行
No.

134
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:51,860
好了  似乎现在可以暂停一下
Okay, that looks like a good stopping point.

135
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:55,120
卡卢医生  你来
Dr. Kalu...step in.

136
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,070
-有什么问题吗  -没有  看起来很好
- Something wrong? -No, it looks good.

137
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,970
我只是想给卡卢医生一个机会
I just want to give Dr. Kalu an opportunity

138
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:01,450
让他展示一下他的能耐
to show us what he can do.

139
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,050
只要你没意见就行
As long as that's okay with you.

140
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:04,570
当然
Sure.

141
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,560
谢谢  安德鲁斯医生
Thank you, Dr. Andrews.

142
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:27,930
好了  看上去不错
All right, looking good.

143
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:30,680
开始做另一侧
Let's move to the lateral side.

144
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:33,650
姑娘们  今晚我们去哪儿玩
So, what are we doing tonight, ladies?

145
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:35,170
去非凡酒吧怎么样
How about we go to Viva's?

146
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,440
好主意
Sounds good.

147
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:38,710
电刀
Bovie.

148
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,680
你怎么这么安静  布朗医生
You're awfully quiet over there, Dr. Browne.

149
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,280
我只是在专注做事
I'm just focused.

150
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,040
我知道你平时都和梅伦德斯一起上手术
I know you're used to operating with Melendez,

151
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,270
但我们这比较有意思
but we have fun here.

152
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:49,980
我觉得当人们放松时
I feel like when it's less tense,

153
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,520
会更少犯错
people make fewer mistakes.

154
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:52,620
好的
Okay.

155
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,320
你想做另一条腿吗
You wanna take the other leg?

156
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,490
真的
Really?

157
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:59,520
当然  实践是最好的学习方式  不是吗
Yeah, best way to learn is by doing it, right?

158
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,380
当然
Definitely.

159
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,440
那就放手去做吧
So go for it.

160
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:07,500

? I'd rather be alone ?

184

梅利莎在你家等你呢
你去哪了

00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:07,720

肖恩  早上好
Shaun, good morning.

190
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,170
早上好  格拉斯曼医生
Good morning, Dr. Glassman.

191
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,150
和梅利莎聊得怎么样
How'd it go with Melissa?

192
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:49,760
她对我...
She was...

193
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:51,520
帮助很大
very helpful.

194
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,510
你穿的衣服和昨天一样  肖恩
You're wearing the same clothes as yesterday, Shaun.

195
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,270
你先请
After you.

196
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:08,480
很显然我们各执己见
Apparently we are at an impasse.

197
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,100
我真的认为梅利莎可以帮到你
I feel strongly that Melissa can be very helpful to you.

198
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,670
而你却完全不这么认为
You feel so strongly that she can't

199
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:18,250
甚至愿意为此牺牲良好的睡眠和个人卫生
that you're willing to sacrifice a good night's sleep and hygiene.

200
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,620
肖恩  你身上有味道了
Shaun, you smell.

201
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,100
我会在医生休息室冲个澡
I will shower in the doctor's lounge.

202
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,520
那真是太好了
Well, great.

203
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,580
至少一个问题解决了
That solves one problem.

204
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,730
你不惜待在这一整晚  就为了逃避面谈
You stayed here all night just to avoid a confrontation.

205
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:35,460
直接说「不去」就好  肖恩
Just say "No," Shaun.

206
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,670
直接说「不去」
You know? Just say "No."

207
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,510
不去
No!

208
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,360
不去
No.

209
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,320
很好  好极了
Great. That's just great.

210
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:44,380
我不用非得去见梅利莎
I don't have to see Melissa?

211
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,940
不用  你不用非得去见梅利莎
No, you don't have to see Melissa.

212
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:49,230
你是个成年人了  你可以自己拿主意
You're a grown man. You can make your own decisions.

213
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:52,780
我只是觉得她会对你有所帮助
I just happen to feel that she could be of great help to you.

214
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:53,660
这...
That...

215
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,510
这样吧
I'll tell you what.

216
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:59,190
如果你见三次梅利莎
You see Melissa three times

217
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:03,590
我就给你买你想要装在电视上的环绕声系统如何
and I will buy you the surround-sound system you want for your television.

218
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:05,020
你在收买我吗
Are you bribing me?

219
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,190
我想是的
I suppose I am.

220
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:10,310
如果你不喜欢她  她会离开
If you don't like her, she'll leave.

221
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:13,730
而且我保证我之后再也不会插手这件事
And I promise I will never say another word about it.

222
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,510
这是个很棒的交易
That's a pretty good deal.

223
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:22,480
好吧
Okay.

224
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,030
好
Okay.

225
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:27,910
我今晚会和她见面
I will meet with her tonight.

226
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,370
这就对了  肖恩
That's good, Shaun.

227
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:44,010
生理盐水吗  我之前从未见过这种方法
Saline? I've never seen it done quite like that.

228
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:47,240
我有个教授来自葡萄牙
Yeah, I had a professor from Portugal.

229
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,210
他们那里就是这么做的
Apparently it's how they do it over there.

230
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:52,410
这可以缓解疼痛
It's supposed to lessen the pain.

231
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:54,360
好消息是你的组织活性良好  呈粉红色
Well, the good news is your tissue is nice and pink,

232
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,660
这说明你的腿很健康
which means it's healthy.

233
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:58,810
不幸的是  水肿并没有如我们所愿的消下去
Unfortunately, the swelling is not coming down like we'd hoped.

234
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,140
这是不是意味着你们要给我截肢了
Does this mean you're going to have to amputate?

235
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,320
不  不  有时我们需要时间
No, no. Sometimes it just takes time.

236
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:04,760
我们会治好你的
We'll take care of you.

237
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,210
做得很好  布朗医生
Very nice work, Dr. Browne.

238
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,370
能帮我个忙  交换一下患者吗
Can you do me a solid and trade patients?

239
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:24,740
不  不可能  安德鲁斯让我主管患者
No, not a chance. Andrews let me take lead.

240
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,200
科利也让我主管
Coyle let me take lead, too.

241
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:28,770
那有什么问题
So what is the problem?

242
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,880
他有点太过友好了
He's a little too friendly.

243
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,160
他很奇怪地拍了我的背
He patted my back in a weird way.

244
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,870
我说不好  我觉得有些尴尬
I don't know. It was -- It was awkward.

245
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,890
我想他只是想和你融洽相处而已
I'm sure he's just trying to establish a rapport.

246
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:41,630
或许吧
Maybe?

247
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,880
我不知...
I don't...

248
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,000
肖恩  换吗
Shaun? Switch?

249
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,790
不换
No.

250
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:48,510
我喜欢博比
I like Bobby.

251
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,100
他可以给我很好的建议
He has very good advice.

252
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,120
所以  谁都做了什么
So, who did what?

253
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:00,220
大部分手术是由我和安德鲁斯医生完成的
Well, I did, uh, most of the surgery along with Dr. Andrews

254
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:03,160
卡卢医生负责更换你的一条撕裂韧带
and Dr. Kalu aided in replacing one of your torn ligaments.

255
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:05,500
几周之内你就能恢复到竞技状态
You should be back in competition shape in a few weeks time.

256
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,910
酷毙了
Word.

257
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,040
那你呢  你做了什么
What about you? What'd you do?

258
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:12,230
我帮忙清理植入的肌腱
I helped to clean the grafted tendons.

259
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:14,930
就这样
That's it.

260
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,750
是的
Yes.

261
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,390
拜托  你没有在这里面鼓捣鼓捣吗
Come on. You didn't get up in there?

262
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:26,120
你的肌无力症状
Y-Your muscle weakness

263
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:29,340
伴随体温升高
along with the high body temperature

264
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:33,030
很可能是多发性硬化的早期症状
could be an early indicator of multiple sclerosis.

265
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,880
我们应该预约磁共振检查
We should order an MRI.

266
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:40,190
我们已经讨论过无数次了
We have talked about this countless times.

267
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:43,230
是的  我们应该预约磁共振检查
Yes. We should order an MRI.

268
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,620
我们不会预约磁共振检查的
We are not ordering an MRI.

269
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,960
你不尊重我
You don't respect me.

270
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,440
现在确实不怎么尊重
Not right now, I don't.

271
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,270
安德鲁斯医生  梅伦德斯医生
Dr. Andrews, Dr. Melendez.

272
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:51,000
我们现在正和职业运动员打交道
Given the fact we're dealing with a pro athlete,

273
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,100
就算是打个小嗝都应该慎重对待
even the slightest hiccup could be problematic.

274
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,910
我想博比会欣赏我们的用心
I think Bobby would be impressed by our being extra attentive.

275
00:13:58,090 --> 00:13:58,810
卡卢说得对
Kalu is right.

276
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:00,550
现在正是他作为专业运动员的鼎盛时期
he is a pro athlete in his prime earning years.

277
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:03,830
我们应该百分之百确保他没事
We should make sure we leave him 100%.

278
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,390
去做磁共振
Do the MRI.

279
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:16,660
干得漂亮  你说服他们了
Nice score. You got 'em to listen.

280
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,080
去做磁共振
Do the MRI.

281
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,470
不是我  是杰瑞德说服他们了
No, Jared did.

282
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,810
为什么他能做到  而你不行
How did he get there when you couldn't?

283
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,390
他说得很友好
He asked nicely.

284
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:27,370
你说得也很友好
Okay, you asked nicely.

285
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:30,670
是的  没错
Yes. Yes, I did.

286
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,180
你要是想要荣耀  就得激烈些  哥们
You gotta be fierce if you want the glory, bro.

287
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,510
不
Oh, no.

288
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,020
我不想要荣耀  哥们
I do not want the glory, bro.

289
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:39,930
我只想成为一个好的外科医生
I just want to be a good surgeon.

290
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:41,160
谁都想要荣耀
Everyone wants glory.

291
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,910
人们因此而实现欲望
It -- It's how you get what you want.

292
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,490
每个人都有欲望
And everybody's got wants.

293
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:50,680
我想要环绕声扬声器系统
I want a surround-sound speaker system.

294
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:54,100
我需要去见治疗师才能得到它
To get it, I have to see a therapist.

295
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,210
我不想要去见治疗师
I don't want to have to see a therapist.

296
00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:00,000
好吧  我就是那么得到第一台PS2游戏机的
Okay, yeah, that's -- that's how I got my first PS2.

297
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:03,770
我父母分开之后  收买我去见的治疗师
Yeah, my parents bribed me to go to therapy after they split up.

298
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,720
治疗师什么样
What was therapy like?

299
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,600
挺简单的  哥们
Pretty basic, bro.

300
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,680
她告诉我该做什么
She'd tell me what to do,

301
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,910
如何与我父母相处
how to deal with my parents.

302
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:09,950
有帮助吗
Was it helpful?

303
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,130
我说不好
I don't know.

304
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:13,530
我从没做过任何她让我做的事
I never did anything she told me to do.

305
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,690
可以这样吗
Is that an option?

306
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:20,740
跟从自己的心  永远没问题
Doing whatever the hell you feel like doing is always an option.

307
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,930
我就提醒一下
Just a gentle reminder --

308
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,450
今晚八点和我爸吃饭
dinner with my dad tonight at 8:00.

309
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:32,830
我记在日程表中了
It is on my calendar.

310
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:34,290
吉普赛国王演唱会也记在日程表中了
So was the Gypsy Kings concert,

311
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:36,250
但我记得...
and I -- I seem to remember...

312
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,470
有道理
Fair enough.

313
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,870
贵宾病例如何了
How is the VIP case?

314
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,430
肖恩似乎有些不对劲
Shaun seems off about something.

315
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:44,230
你和他谈过了吗
Did you talk to him?

316
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:46,680
是啊  和肖恩谈话就能解决问题
Yes. Because talking to Shaun solves problems.

317
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,130
而安德鲁斯...
And Andrews is...

318
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:49,800
他是你的眼中钉
He's a pain in your ass.

319
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,290
不  实际上他太过友好了
No. He's actually too friendly.

320
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:54,810
杰瑞德拍了他的马屁  他就突然不再刻薄了
Jared kisses his ass and suddenly he's cutting.

321
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:58,150
拍马屁是外科医生的实用技能
Well, ass kissing is a useful skill for a surgeon.

322
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:00,070
你的衬衫真好看
That's a very beautiful blouse.

323
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:01,280
我还得去吃晚餐吗
Do I still have to go to dinner?

324
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,660
是的  会很好的
Yes. It'll be nice.

325
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:05,210
你会喝点好红酒  我爸会付账
You'll have some nice wine and my dad will pay.

326
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,970
他会逼我们定下婚礼日期的
He'll push us to set a wedding date.

327
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:08,160
4月25号
April 25th.

328
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,270
你预定什么了吗
Did you book something?

329
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,080
没有
No.

330
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,440
但我爸不需要知道这些
But my dad doesn't need to know that.

331
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:17,880
有什么消息
What do you got?

332
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:20,560
手术修复手肘看起来没问题
Looks like the surgically repaired elbow is fine.

333
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:22,290
如我所料
As I suspected.

334
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:24,430
但莫菲注意到了周边的问题
But Murphy noticed something in the periphery,

335
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:26,180
高一点的地方  就在二头肌上方
a little higher up, just above the bicep.

336
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:28,190
是我的主意
It was my idea.

337
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:29,940
是的  我刚刚说了
Yes, I just said that.

338
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:33,620
所以我们拍了高些地方的片  并注意到了这个
So, we took an image from higher up and noticed this.

339
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:39,800
完全包括住了他的臂丛神经
It's encasing the entirety of his brachial plexus.

340
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,640
这太大了
This thing is massive.

341
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:48,300
活检明确显示这是神经鞘瘤
Biopsy indicated it's definitely a schwannoma.

342
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,430
并且明显是恶性的
And it's definitely malignant.

343
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:53,830
这地方很棘手  但也许你能移除
It's in a tricky spot, but you might be able to remove it.

344
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:57,870
根据放疗化疗结合的手法...
Follow it up with a combo of radiotherapy and chemo to finish it o...

345
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:01,920
怎么了  有什么问题
What? What's the problem?

346
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,300
博比·奥托  博比·奥托  职业玩家博比·奥托
Robert Ato. Bobby Ato. Pro-gamer Bobby Ato?

347
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:06,170
你是他的粉丝吗
You a fan?

348
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:07,530
我三年前遇到过他
I met him three years ago.

349
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:10,020
我在旧金山市立医院当肿瘤学顾问
Oncology consult for SF Muni.

350
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:14,870
他三年前得过癌症
He had cancer three years ago?

351
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:25,150
你为什么没告诉我们你得过癌症
Why the hell wouldn't you tell us that you had already had cancer?

352
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:27,020
那是三年前  在我的小腿部位
It was in my lower leg three years ago.

353
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,810
那和你如何治疗我的手肘有什么关系
How's that gonna change how you fix my elbow?

354
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:32,350
这对我如何看待莫菲医生提到的症状影响巨大
It would have a huge effect on how I viewed the symptoms that Dr. Murphy noticed.

355
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:34,140
你没听莫菲医生的话
You didn't listen to Dr. Murphy

356
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,650
因为你不尊重他
because you don't respect him.

357
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:37,020
因为莫菲医生和常人不同
'Cause Dr. Murphy is different.

358
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,150
我尊重他
I respect him.

359
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:40,090
他有好想法  也有坏想法
He has good ideas, and he has bad ideas.

360
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:42,130
看来你否定的这个是个好想法
Turns out this was a good one. That you shot down.

361
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:44,970
你为什么隐瞒真相
Why did you hide the truth?

362
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,010
之前的肿瘤诊断并不丢人
A previous cancer diagnosis isn't shameful.

363
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,190
首诊之后  我脑袋里全部都是
After the first diagnosis, all I was thinking was,

364
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:04,380
「还会回来吗  有多糟糕呢」
"Will it come back? How bad will it be?"

365
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:05,740
我心烦意乱  哥们
I was distracted, man.

366
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:08,200
我没法专心  我接连失败
I couldn't focus, and I hit a slump --

367
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,490
你担心癌症扰乱了你的比赛
Wait, you were worried that cancer was messing with your gaming?

368
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,660
没错  哥们
Yeah, man!

369
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,420
癌症让我与冠军失之交臂
It cost me a championship.

370
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:17,020
我决定将之与所有负面情绪和身体的虚弱
I decided to block it out along with all the thoughts

371
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,900
一起拒之门外
of negativity and physical weakness,

372
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:22,910
并由此成为了世界第一
and like that, I became the best in the world.

373
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:29,520
我们需要做全身扫描
We need to do a full-body scan

374
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,740
确保癌症没有转移
to make sure the cancer has not already metastasized.

375
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,430
他说了
What he said.

376
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,030
我说的
What I said.

377
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:42,590
看起来不错
This looks great.

378
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:45,180
肿胀开始消退了
The swelling is starting to reduce.

379
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,140
我们可以开始缩紧缝合了
We can start tightening the sutures.

380
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,100
终于有好消息了
Finally some good news.

381
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:52,120
你看起来也好多了
You look like you're doing better, too...

382
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,650
你上司不在之后
now your boss is gone.

383
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:57,400
科利医生吗  他挺好的
Dr. Coyle? He's fine.

384
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:59,740
和我你不用「紧跟党的路线」
You don't have to toe the party line with me.

385
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,760
相信我  我明白
Trust me. I get it.

386
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,120
我差点在单车课上骑车而死
I almost rode myself to death in a spin class

387
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,910
就因为我听见几个投资者说
because I overheard a couple of investors say

388
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:09,670
他们「觉得我的观念还行」
that they "liked the concept just fine,"

389
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:12,530
但我的脚踝「太让人分心」了
but that my cankles were "too distracting."

390
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:15,490
什么  你的想法非常棒
What? Your idea is brilliant.

391
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:18,360
而且你很美  去他们的
And you're beautiful. Screw those jackasses.

392
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,990
格蕾丝  你不明白
Grace, you don't get it.

393
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:23,040
你的脸很美  腰臀比正好
You got the face, perfect little hip-to-waist ratio,

394
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,650
大部分投资公司都是一群男人经营的
and most VC firms are run by a bunch of bros,

395
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:28,790
所以我臀部的大小和我能筹集到的钱财之间
so there is an inverse relationship between the size of my ass

396
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,400
有着反比关系
and how much money I can raise.

397
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,640
那你应该做些别的
Then you should do something else

398
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,620
避免和这群男人打交道
where you don't have to deal with bros.

399
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,200
做什么  修女吗
Like what, become a nun?

400
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,440
-抱歉  -你同意她的话
- Sorry. - You agree with her?

401
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:40,420
她差点害死自己
She nearly worked herself to death

402
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,550
就为了取悦几头有钱的猪猡
trying to please some pigs with money?

403
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:43,690
她不该如此
She shouldn't have to.

404
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:45,640
好极了  你要是找到了乌托邦  一定要告诉我
Great. Let me know when you find utopia.

405
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,090
但在那之前  我热爱我的工作
But until then, I love what I do.

406
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:51,310
所以我得遵守游戏规则  因为我要是让他们滚
So I got to play the game 'cause if I call them out,

407
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:54,610
我只会被贴上「婊子」的标签  甚至更糟
I just get labeled a "Bitch," or even worse.

408
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,940
你的心率升高了
Your heart rate's going up.

409
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,590
黑兹尔
Hazel?

410
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,250
黑兹尔
Hazel?

411
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:03,140
她快无法呼吸了
She's barely moving any air.

412
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:04,760
黑兹尔  能听到我说话吗
Hazel, can you hear me?

413
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:07,370
紧急呼叫  我得给她插管
Code blue! I need to intubate her.

414
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:09,100
给我一个咽喉镜和气管内管
Give me a laryngoscope and an ET tube.

415
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,380
给她吸纯氧
Let's get her on 100% oxygen.

416
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:14,430
紧急呼叫  四楼北面  407房间
Code blue. 4 North, room 407.

417
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,390
说说情况
Talk to me.

418
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:19,400
她的肺
Her lungs --

419
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:21,540
我认为再灌注损伤了
I think it's a reperfusion injury.

420
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:23,920
里面没有空间了
There's no room in here.

421
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,620
气道情况三级  甚至四级  你应该接手
Mallampati 3, maybe 4. You should take over.

422
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:29,010
你做得很好  给  用探条
You're doing fine. Here, use the bougie.

423
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,890
-感觉到会厌软骨了吗  -好像有
- You feel the epiglottis? - I think so.

424
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,760
好  再进去一点  你应该感觉进不去了
Okay, go a bit further, you should feel it stop.

425
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:39,560
如果能继续进去  那你就到了食道
If it keeps going, you're in the esophagus.

426
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,530
进不去了  好了  气管内管
It stopped, got it. ET tube?

427
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,790
会没事的
It's gonna be okay.

428
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,750
干得漂亮  医生
Strong work, Doctor.

429
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:00,210
不管是不是世界第一  这家伙疯了
Best in the world or not, this guy's insane.

430
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:02,030
竟然想躲过诊断
Hiding from a diagnosis?

431
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:05,560
没用的  它会找上你
Doesn't work -- it'll find you.

432
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,990
博比想成为最棒的  他是最棒的
Bobby wanted to be the best. He is the best.

433
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,380
我觉得他不是想成为最棒的
I don't think he was trying to be the best.

434
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,480
他应该只是害怕了
I think he was just scared.

435
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,490
那是什么  脑干旁边的
What's that? Next to the brain stem.

436
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,550
另一个神经鞘瘤
Another schwannoma.

437
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:27,830
正面情绪的力量到此为止
So much for the power of positive thinking.

438
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,250
这孩子真奇怪  他得过癌症
He's a strange kid. He had cancer.

439
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:40,950
就因为有所失去而停止跟进疾病
Stopped going to follow-ups because he started losing.

440
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,940
哪里奇怪了
What's so strange?

441
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,890
听着就是典型的否认情绪
Sounds like a classic case of denial.

442
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:46,680
我在想我们是否可以尝试新方法
I was thinking we could try something new.

443
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,750
或许用伽马刀
Maybe gamma knife?

444
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:50,660
我觉得不行  不适用于这种肿瘤
I don't think so. Wrong type of tumor for that.

445
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:53,650
如果我每过几个月就告诉你
What if I told you every few months

446
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:57,010
你很有可能要死  你会怎么样
that you had a real possibility you were gonna die?

447
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,650
我会很害怕  而且会听医生的话
I'd be scared. And I'd listen.

448
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,680
你可能会  也可能不会
Maybe you would, maybe you wouldn't.

449
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,680
就我个人而言  我觉得他没错
Personally, I think he's right --

450
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,150
拒绝这些世界末日的声音
shut down those voices of doom,

451
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:08,220
把时间用来去生活而不是等待死亡
spend your days living instead of dying.

452
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,380
但他也可能疯了
But he may also be crazy.

453
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:14,140
除了把他变成植物人
Short of making him a vegetable,

454
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:16,120
我不知道我们还能做什么
I don't know if there's anything we can do.

455
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:22,620
肖恩还好吗
Is -- Is Shaun okay?

456
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,030
他的工作还好吗
Is his work okay?

457
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,190
都好  只是
Yes, I just, um --

458
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:28,330
那他就没事
Then he's fine.

459
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,050
该死
Damn.

460
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,490
马进到酒吧来了
Horse walks into a bar.

461
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:52,980
酒保说...
Bartender says...

462
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:56,600
我们发现了另一处肿瘤
We found another mass.

463
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:00,260
虽然事与愿违  但没事
That's not how it goes, but cool.

464
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,300
我们也把它取出来
Let's knock it out, too.

465
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:03,630
肿瘤长在你的脑干上
The mass is located on your brain stem.

466
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:06,420
脑干是控制你的自主神经系统
Which controls your autonomic nervous system --

467
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:09,050
你的心脏和呼吸的
your heart, respiration.

468
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:11,550
其所在的位置让我们无法进行手术
Its positioning makes it inoperable.

469
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,030
我有过好成绩
I...had a good run.

470
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:30,620
我希望能持续更久  但...
Wish it was longer, but...

471
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:34,200
我在巅峰时刻结束
I'm gonna go out on top.

472
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,960
如果你们今天离开这个世界
If you went out today,

473
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:41,440
你们能说一样的话吗
could you say the same thing?

474
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,390
你当时在场是她的福气
She's lucky you were there.

475
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,920
我  你才是那个救了她的人
Me? You're the one who saved her.

476
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,940
在你的帮助下  很大的帮助
With your help. A lot of it.

477
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:02,180
所以  谢谢你
So, thank you.

478
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,120
你想喝一杯吗
Hey, look, you wanna -- you wanna get a drink?

479
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:09,330
也许缓一缓
Maybe take the edge off?

480
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:12,240
不用了  但还是谢谢你
No. But thank you, though.

481
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:15,670
你确定吗  我保证你会很开心
Are you sure? I promise you'll have fun.

482
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:17,520
我按摩手法很棒
I give great massages.

483
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:20,010
早上我会给你做一个好吃到死的煎蛋卷
And I'll make a killer omelet in the morning.

484
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,800
这真是太不合适了
That's really inappropriate.

485
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,210
我说了不
I said no.

486
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,710
抱歉  这又是哪一出
I'm sorry. W-W-- Where's this coming from?

487
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:30,640
你给了我很明确的暗示
You were -- You were clearly giving me signals.

488
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,750
不  我给你唯一的「暗示」
No, the only "Signal" I gave you

489
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:34,240
就是我对你完全不感兴趣
was that I wasn't interested in the slightest.

490
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:36,870
我只是听到你和卡卢
Okay, see, I just -- I heard about you and Kalu

491
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:38,360
在检录处约炮  所以我以为...
banging in the call room, so I figured --

492
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,180
谈话到此结束  你这个混蛋
This conversation is over. You're an ass.

493
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,550
我是个很随和的人
I'm pretty easygoing,

494
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:44,400
但你在违抗命令
but you're approaching insubordination.

495
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,740
你要举报我吗
You're gonna report me?

496
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,330
我不会举报任何人
I'm not gonna report anybody.

497
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:50,790
但也许下一次
But maybe next time,

498
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:53,920
当有人约你的时候  别这么死板
try not to have such a stick up your ass about being asked out.

499
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:02,150
拜托
Come on.

500
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:04,190
我一直以为小兔是最可爱的昵称
I always thought Bunny was the cutest nickname.

501
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:05,770
你当然这样认为  但当我12岁或20岁时
Of course you did, but you could've stopped calling me that

502
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:08,920
你可以不要那样叫我了
when I was 12 or -- or 20.

503
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:12,250
今天过得不顺吗
Rough day?

504
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:17,400
是的  发生了一些事
Yeah. Yeah, it was something.

505
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:20,350
这应该能让你开心点
Well, this should make you a little happier.

506
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:24,470
我决定承包你们整个婚礼
I have decided to take care of your entire wedding.

507
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:25,980
我们不需要
We don't need it.

508
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,410
不用谢
You're welcome.

509
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:29,610
我们又不是21岁的小孩
We're not 21.

510
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:32,600
我们能够轻松负担自己的婚礼
We're more than capable of paying for our own wedding.

511
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:33,890
我们赚的钱够多
We make good money.

512
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,150
但一旦你们有了孩子就不够了  小兔
But you won't once you start having kids, Bunny.

513
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,900
你在这里干什么
What are you doing in here?

514
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,050
我在躲避我的治疗师
I'm hiding from my therapist.

515
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:03,030
我得不到立体音响系统
I am not going to get a surround-sound speaker system.

516
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,150
但我会做任何我想做的事情
But I am doing whatever the hell I feel like doing.

517
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,880
可以把拖把递给我吗
Can you hand me that mop?

518
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:09,900
好的
Okay.

519
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:20,610
你对你的一生所做之事满意吗
Are you satisfied with what you've done with your life?

520
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,730
如果你明天就死了  你会开心吗
Would you be happy if you died tomorrow?

521
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,150
满意
Satisfied?

522
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,540
开心
Happy?

523
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:34,050
我在楼里做保洁...
I mean, I clean up a building, uh...

524
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:37,930
但我娶了此生挚爱
But I -- I married the love of my life.

525
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:41,190
我们养育了三个漂亮的孩子
Uh, we raised three beautiful kids.

526
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:45,040
其中一个有点淘气  但她现在乖多了
One of them had some troubles, but she's doing great now.

527
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:49,040
另外两个都做得很好
The other two are doing all right for themselves.

528
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,790
我对人也很友善
And I was good to people.

529
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:53,790
至少我这样认为
At least I think I was.

530
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:58,220
这个答案很棒
That's a very good answer.

531
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,490
如果你想看  我有女儿们的照片
I got pictures of the girls if you want see --

532
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:05,330
不用了
No.

533
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:10,090
你为什么要我辞职去组建家庭
So, why do I need to quit my job to have a family?

534
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:11,360
同意
Agreed.

535
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,670
她可以既是优秀的律师又是优秀的母亲
She can be a great lawyer and a great mom.

536
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:16,270
是的  她可以  但是为什么呢
Yes, she can, but why?

537
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:20,080
为什么要把时间浪费在工作上
W-Why waste your time working?

538
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,320
你应该像我一样  享受生活
You should be enjoying life, like me.

539
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,880
家庭信托里有很多钱

Dad, my work is important. I'm helping people --

541
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,960
小兔  你坐办公室
Bunny... you're pushing papers.

542
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,420
怎么能真的帮到人
How -- How is that really helping anyone?

543
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,230
也许我守旧  但我不明白
And maybe I'm old-fashioned, but I don't get it.

544
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:35,110
我以为你会更聪明
I-I thought you were smarter than that.

545
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:37,210
你宁愿她做懒惰的寄生虫
You'd prefer her to be a lazy parasite

546
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:38,250
靠信托基金过日子
living off a trust fund

547
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:40,650
而不是真的去为社会做贡献
as opposed to actually contributing to society?

548
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,100
寄生虫
Parasite?

549
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:45,850

我没有伤害任何人
I'm not hurting anyone.

553
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:57,670
事实上  我用自己的方式帮助他人
In fact, I go out of my way to help people.

554
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:03,310
所以如果你认为我不值得尊敬  那么抱歉
So I'm sorry if that doesn't qualify me as a worthwhile person in your book.

555
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:08,100
我出去时会结账
I'll get the check on my way out.

556
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,060
爸爸  你不必...
Dad, you don't have to...

557
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,900
我做错了什么  肖恩
What am I doing wrong, Shaun?

558
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,700
我不知道
I don't know.

559
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:47,380
我试着...
I tried...

560
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,750
鼓励你  我试着支持你
encouraging, I've tried being supportive,

561
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,990
我试着讨好你
I've tried bribing you.

562
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:57,000
我不需要治疗师  不
I don't need a therapist. No.

563
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,120
看看四周  你看你睡在...
Look around you. What -- You're sleeping --

564
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,040
这个杂物室里
What is this, a broom closet?

565
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:04,790
看看你愿意做出的牺牲
Look at the sacrifices you're willing to make

566
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:06,300
只为了避开...
just to avoid...

567
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,390
我们稍后再聊
We're gonna pick this up later.

568
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,220
你得跟人事部提出投诉
You have to file a complaint with HR.

569
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:24,620
那样我会得到「敌意」和「难相处」的标签
I do that and I get labeled "Hostile" and "Difficult,"

570
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:27,050
对我的肤色和性别都没帮助
neither of which work with my complexion or gender.

571
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:28,450
正因此才更应该表态
All the more reason to take a stand.

572
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:31,010
克莱尔  这种情况就该找人事部
Claire, this situation is exactly what HR is for.

573
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:32,560
我没说这很容易
I didn't say it was easy.

574
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:33,830
是  你说了
Yeah, you did.

575
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:35,710
这挺可怕而且需要勇气
Look, it's scary and it takes courage,

576
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:36,830
但这是对的事
but it's the right thing to do.

577
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:38,210
这是无意义的事
It's a pointless thing to do.

578
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:40,840
-他们会听你说  -他们会把错怪在我身上
- They'll listen to you. - They will shift the blame onto me.

579
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:41,920
就像你一样
Like you did.

580
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:43,830
什么  我怎么...
Whoa, what? How did I --

581
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:44,830
我找你说
I came to you,

582
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:46,640
你指责我把情况夸大
you accused me of exaggerating to get back onto the case.

583
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:48,580
不不  我不是那个意思  我不知道...
No, no, no, that's not what I meant. I had no idea --

584
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:50,160
我说他太友好亲切了
I said he was too friendly.

585
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,840
你说他只是「试着建立密切关系」
You said he was "Trying to establish a rapport."

586
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:56,480
我是你的枕边人  杰瑞德
I'm sleeping with you, Jared,

587
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,210
而你都认为我反应过度了
and you thought I was overreacting.

588
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:00,830
你觉得三个陌生人会怎么看呢
How do you think three strangers will see things?

589
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,990
克莱尔  我很抱歉  非常抱歉
Claire, I'm sorry. I am so sorry.

590
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:10,040
别担心  那很正常
Don't worry about it. It's just the way it is.

591
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,570
我还有患者要去巡视
I've got a patient to round on.

592
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,360
我和梅伦德斯医生谈过了
Dr. Melendez and I had a talk

593
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:19,260
我们相信我们能切除肿瘤
and we believe we can excise the tumor

594
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,850
只要你愿意做出牺牲
if you're willing to make a sacrifice.

595
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,880
牺牲
Sacrifice?

596
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,000
听起来比死亡好
That sounds better than death.

597
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:27,420
我也是那么想
My thinking as well.

598
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,640
我们相信我们可以移除肿块
We believe we can remove the mass,

599
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,950
但我们也要从你的脑干取出一块东西
but we'll also have to take a piece out of your brain stem.

600
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:35,450
一块红核
A chunk of the red nucleus,

601
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:37,870
它的功能是控制你的左侧身体
which helps control the left side of your body.

602
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:40,420
你的那一侧会瘫痪
You'll be paralyzed on that side.

603
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:45,590
也可能造成进食和吞咽困难
It could also result in difficulty eating and swallowing.

604
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:47,270
说话困难
Speech difficulties.

605
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:52,910
我们做吧
Let's do it.

606
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:54,230
好样的
Good for you.

607
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,310
慢着  慢着
Hold on. Hold on.

608
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:01,360
博比  这手术风险很高
Bobby, this is very risky surgery.

609
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,000
你可能会死在手术台  就算一切顺利
You could die on the table, and even if all goes well,

610
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,030
你也会严重残疾
you will be severely disabled.

611
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:09,290
是的  我听到了  我接受
Yeah, I -- I was listening, and I'm in.

612
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:21,790
各位  我明白
Guys, hey, I get it.

613
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,790
如果我死了  我就死了
If I'm dead, I'm -- I'm dead.

614
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:31,030
如果没有  体育锻炼  再学习等等
But if not -- PT, relearning stuff, whatever.

615
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,540
都不会阻止我继续比赛
It's not gonna stop me from competing.

616
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:35,510
永远不会
Not ever.

617
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:40,530
博比  你的事业结束了
Bobby, your career is over.

618
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:42,100
你得明白这点
We need you to understand that.

619
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:50,840
是吗
Yeah?

620
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,960
一朝玩家  永世玩家
Once a gamer, always a gamer, huh?

621
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,060
我很钦佩你
You got my respect.

622
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:23,890
你发什么疯
What the hell is your problem?

623
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:25,810
如果你敢威胁克莱尔
If you ever threaten Claire,

624
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:26,950
跟她说话轻佻
take a disrespectful tone,

625
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:28,990
或是再敢斜视她
or so much as look at her cross-eyed again,

626
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:32,060
我会做出比把你推到墙上更可怕的事
I'm gonna do a hell of a lot more than put you up against a wall.

627
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:33,540
明白吗
We clear?

628
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:49,080
你的肺部情况好多了
Your lungs are looking a lot better.

629
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:53,460
总得来说你的情况不错
Overall, you're in pretty good shape.

630
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,150
谢谢你
Thank you.

631
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:02,750
不客气
You're welcome.

632
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:05,130
都是医生该做的
All part of the service.

633
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:08,270
你干得很好
And good for you.

634
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:11,350
我没睡着
I wasn't sleeping.

635
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:15,110
我听到你是怎么对付另一位医生的
I heard the way you handled that other doctor.

636
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:19,710
你全都听到了
You heard that? All of it?

637
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:23,050
但愿我也做得出来
I wish I had done that.

638
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,530
你很勇敢
You were brave.

639
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:27,340
不不
No, no.

640
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,850
我要是勇敢
If I was brave, I --

641
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,180
里克·艾伦
Rick Allen.

642
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:44,560
英国重金属新浪潮的代表性乐队之一

643
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:44,560
-谁  -威豹乐队的独臂鼓手
- Who? - One-armed drummer for Def Leppard.

644
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,570
拜托
Come on, man.

645
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:49,540
而这是肿瘤囊膜
And there is the tumor capsule.

646
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:52,090
里奇·帕克  有人知道吗
Richie Parker. Anyone?

647
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:55,500
那个赛车协会的吗  工程师  对吧
Isn't he a NASCAR guy? An engineer, right?

648
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,580
天生缺个胳膊
Born without arms?

649
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:59,620
奥坎波护士获得开门奖
And Nurse Ocampo gets the door prize.

650
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:02,260
现在我们从这个东西上面
And now we will take just a little piece

651
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:06,770
取一小块样品去做检查
of our friend here -- a nice sample to test.

652
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,080
谢谢  医生
Thank you, Doctor.

653
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:09,280
现在剩下的
And now the rest.

654
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:11,070
他或许没法自己系鞋带
He may not be able to tie his own shoes,

655
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:13,870
但我不会打赌他不能再比赛了
but I wouldn't bet against him ever competing again.

656
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:17,560
「不自由  毋宁死」
Aut libertatem aut mortem mihi da.

657
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,220
肖恩  你知道这是什么意思吗
Shaun, do you know that means?

658
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:22,680
不知道  跟手术无关
No. It's not relevant to this surgery.

659
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:25,030
有关系  查查看
Oh, it's relevant. Look it up.

660
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,280
无关
No, it's not.

661
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:31,040
心率和末二氧化碳浓度在上升
Heart rate and ETCO2 are rising.

662
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,780
体温稍有变化
Slight change in body temperature.

663
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:33,990
他的心率108了
His heart rate's 108.

664
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:35,860
检查插管  给他抽吸
Check tube placement and suction him.

665
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,030
他要是情况恶化  我们或许得放弃手术
If he takes a turn, we might have to abort.

666
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:40,020
我不觉得  都到这个地步了
I don't think so. I'm too far in.

667
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:41,090
稳住他
Keep him stable.

668
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:42,500
心动过速  心率攀升
He's tachy. Heart rate's climbing.

669
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:46,130
115  117  120  还在升
115, 117, 120, and rising.

670
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,530
他要室性心动过速了
He is going into v-tach.

671
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:50,730
罗伯特·奥托要死了
Robert Ato is dying.

672
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:58,370
我要慢慢把脑桥拿出来
I'm gonna pull out of the pons slowly.

673
00:34:58,370 --> 00:34:59,350
等一下  你现在拿出来
Well, hold on. You pull out now,

674
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:00,910
可能会损坏到小脑脚
you might damage the cerebellar peduncle.

675
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:03,810
如果我现在不拿出来  他一旦开始抽搐就会死
If I don't get out now, I'll kill him if he starts seizing.

676
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:06,090
有点不对劲  心搏过速
Something's not right. Tachycardia?

677
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:07,800
心搏缓慢更说得通
Bradycardia would make more sense.

678
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:11,910
-有什么想法吗  -谁有想法
- Ideas. - Anyone?

679
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:15,170
告诉我你看到的
Tell me what you see.

680
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:18,330
心搏过速  体温再次升高
Tachycardia, rising body temperature again,

681
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:21,100
肌肉僵硬  二氧化碳在升高
muscle rigidity, CO2 is rising.

682
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,560
肌肉僵硬  哪一边
Muscle rigidity? Which side?

683
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,900
所有的肌肉
It's all over.

684
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,040
那就不是脑干的问题
Then it's not the brain stem.

685
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,030
否则只会有一边肌肉僵硬
We'd only have muscle rigidity on one side.

686
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:30,970
快想  心搏过速  体温升高  二氧化碳
Think. Tachycardia, rising temp, CO2...

687
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,110
二氧化碳...
CO2...

688
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:34,740
是麻药
It's the anesthesia.

689
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,930
恶性高热  把恶性高热急救车推过来

712
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,180
我也想和你说同样的事情

713
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:54,880
请吧
Please.

714

结果比预想的要好

你左边还是会有明显的神经功能障碍

717
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:18,440
但是没我们预想得那么严重

718
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:21,350

你得耐心点
You have to be patient.

722
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:42,960
不要
Nah.

723
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:47,800
有耐心是一件坏事吗
Is patience a bad thing?

724
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,310
接受才是一件坏事
Acceptance is a bad thing.

725
00:37:57,810 --> 00:38:03,340
我小时候不擅长玩抛接子游戏
When I was a kid, I -- I wasn't good at jack.

726
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:07,700
但我从没放弃
But I never quit.

727
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:10,190
我...
I...

728
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,430
成功了
found my thing.

729
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:21,450
永远都不要让别人告诉你
Don't ever let anyone tell you

730
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:26,070
你能做什么  不能...
what you can and can't...

731
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:28,590
做什么...
do.

732
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:58,510
昨晚的事对不起
I'm sorry. For last night.

733
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:02,490
昨天过得很不顺  我很累
It was a rough day. I was tired.

734
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,160
也许有点太...
Probably had a few too...

735
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:08,140
你和你爸的关系是你的事...
Your relationship with your father is your business --

736
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,430
尼尔  你不用这样
Neil, you don't have to.

737
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,640
我会给你爸打电话
I'll call your dad, and --

738
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,780
我不想要孩子
I don't want to have kids.

739
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:38,960
肖恩  我送你回家
Shaun, I'm gonna drive you home.

740
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:41,950
你会见到梅利莎
You're gonna see Melissa.

741
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:43,610
如果你不喜欢她  她就会离开
If you don't like her, she'll leave.

742
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,120
但是不要再逃避了
But there's no more running away.

743
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:49,770
你觉得我为什么要这么做
Why do you think I'm doing this?

744
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:52,490
因为你很固执
Because you are stubborn.

745
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:55,450
好吧  是的  好  你说得对  我很固执
Ok-Okay, yeah, okay, sure. I'm stubborn.

746
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:57,770
但是我这都是为了你  好吗
But I'm doing this for you, okay?

747
00:39:57,970 --> 00:39:59,450
这样你就可以过上更好的生活
So that you can have a better life,

748
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:01,540
过上更开心的生活
so that you can have a happier life.

749
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:04,640
如果这不会让我开心呢
What if it doesn't make me happy?

750
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:07,690
如果这不会让我开心呢
What if it doesn't make me happy?

751
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:10,350
如果这只让你感到开心呢
What if it only makes you happy?

752
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:14,500
你觉得我这么做是为了让自己开心
You think -- You think I'm doing this to make me happy?

753
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,250
我不开心  肖恩
I'm not happy, Shaun.

754
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:19,150
我一点也不开心  你知道吗
I'm not close to being happy, and you know what?

755

我不想再解释了
I am done explaining,

756
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:23,800
我不想再讨好你  我不想再说了
I am done bribing, and I am done talking.

757
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,090
-现在快走吧  -不  不不  不
- Now let's go. - No. N-No. No!

758
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,570
-走  -不

759
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:27,600

不  我  我想自己做决定
No, I -- I want to make my own decisions.

-我...  -肖恩  你能小点声吗  拜托
- I -- - Shaun, can you keep your voice down, please? Please?

762
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:36,260
你不能一直这么命令我
You -- You cannot keep ordering me around, okay?

763
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:37,820
你不是我爸
You're not my father!

764
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:41,090
我知道
I know that.

765
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:44,020
肖恩  我不明白
Shaun, I don't understand...

766
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:47,160
好  你不想...为什么这让你如此苦恼
Okay.You don't let ...why this is so upsetting.

767
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,400
-有人告诉过你该怎么做  -我不明白
- Anyone ever tell you what you can and can't do-- - I don't get it.

768
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:52,330
肖恩  冷静点  拜托
Shaun, let's just calm down now, please.

769
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,650
-好了  好了  -永远都不要让别人告诉你
- Okay, okay. - Don't let anyone

770
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:55,810
你能做什么  不能做什么
ever tell you what you can and can't do!

771
00:40:55,810 --> 00:40:56,980
冷静点  肖恩  别这样
Hey, just calm -- Shaun. Hey,

772
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:58,230
-我想自己做决定  -肖恩
- I want to make my own decisions. - Shaun.

773
00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:00,380
-我想自己做决定  -好  好  好
- I want to make my own decisions! - Okay, okay, okay.

00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:02,130
-我只是想帮忙  -我想自己做...
- I'm just trying to help. - I want make my own --

775
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:03,360
-我不需要帮忙  -肖恩
- I don't want help! - Shaun!

776
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:05,960
我...
I --

777
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,480
你在想什么
What were you thinking?!

778
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:21,860
我不需要你为我打架
I do not need you to fight my battles,

779
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:24,130
我也没有要求你这样做过
and I certainly never asked you to.

780
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:26,340
如果你真的尊重我的话
And if you really respected me,

781
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:28,410
你就不会像对待一个
you would not treat me like some damsel

782
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:29,640
需要保护的小姑娘似的对待我
who needed protection, okay?

783
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,100
你会给予我
You would treat me with the respect

784
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:33,450
应有的尊重
that you would automatically give to a man.

785
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:36,660
你会像对待有自理能力的人一样对待我
You'd treat me like a person capable of handling her own life!

786
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:40,090
也许  也许这对你要求太多了
And maybe -- maybe it's too much to ask of you.

787
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,910
很显然安德鲁斯同意你的看法
Apparently Andrews agrees with you.

788
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:46,920
我因为殴打同事被解雇了
I've just been fired for physically assaulting an employee.

789
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:55,740
肖恩  肖恩
Shaun? Shaun!

790
00:41:56,910 --> 00:41:57,940
他去哪了
Where would he go?

791
00:41:58,290 --> 00:42:00,040
有他想去的地方吗
Is there a place he likes to hang out,

792
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,530
他觉得舒服的地方
a place where he feels comfortable?

793
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:02,710
不  我不知道
No, I don't know.

794
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:04,400
他不在医院
I mean, he's not at the hospital.

795
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:08,990
以前这里有一张肖恩和...
And there used to be a picture here of Shaun...

796
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:12,630
他弟弟史蒂夫的照片
and his brother, Steve.

797
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:15,850
你觉得这是什么意思
What do you think that means?

798
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,550
意思是他不会回来了
It means he's not coming back.
