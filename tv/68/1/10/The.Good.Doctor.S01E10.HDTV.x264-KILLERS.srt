1
00:00:01,836 --> 00:00:04,296
Good news. I have a VIP
who needs a multiple ligament

2
00:00:04,359 --> 00:00:06,560
reconstruction on his elbow,
and I've got room

3
00:00:06,633 --> 00:00:09,367
for a couple residents
to assist me and Dr. Melendez.

4
00:00:09,469 --> 00:00:10,484
Awesome.

5
00:00:10,586 --> 00:00:13,005
I've never assisted
on one of those before.

6
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:14,039
Dr. Andrews knows that.

7
00:00:14,102 --> 00:00:15,636
That's why he's acting
like it's Christmas morning.

8
00:00:15,704 --> 00:00:16,931
I'm guessing you've never operated

9
00:00:16,962 --> 00:00:18,439
on a pro athlete, either.

10
00:00:18,507 --> 00:00:20,360
Um, last time I checked,

11
00:00:20,415 --> 00:00:22,749
a "couple" means "two,"
and there's three of us.

12
00:00:22,825 --> 00:00:24,192
More good news.

13
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:27,596
Whoever isn't with us
will be assisting Dr. Coyle

14
00:00:27,663 --> 00:00:29,431
on a double-leg fasciotomy.

15
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:31,900
Feeling lucky?

16
00:00:33,936 --> 00:00:35,570
Murphy.

17
00:00:35,903 --> 00:00:38,607
VIP elbow. Sweet.

18
00:00:40,877 --> 00:00:42,978
Fasciotomy.

19
00:00:43,045 --> 00:00:44,045
Whoo.

20
00:00:45,781 --> 00:00:47,616
Bobby Ato?
Don't think I've heard of him.

21
00:00:47,683 --> 00:00:49,184
He's a pro athlete?

22
00:00:49,252 --> 00:00:50,952
He's a pro. I don't know
if I'd call him in athlete.

23
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,921
E-sports.

24
00:00:52,989 --> 00:00:54,022
Video games?

25
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,056
He's one of the best in the world.

26
00:00:55,124 --> 00:00:56,191
Last year, he won enough prize money

27
00:00:56,259 --> 00:00:58,393
to buy his mom a beach house
in Monterey.

28
00:00:58,461 --> 00:00:59,895
Paid cash.

29
00:00:59,962 --> 00:01:02,631
Is he considered a very important person

30
00:01:02,698 --> 00:01:05,500
because he's an athlete or
because he has a lot of money?

31
00:01:05,568 --> 00:01:06,568
- Both.
- Both.

32
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,503
Mm.

33
00:01:15,177 --> 00:01:17,379
I have to go.

34
00:01:23,486 --> 00:01:25,654
Morning, Shaun.

35
00:01:25,721 --> 00:01:27,556
This is Melissa Bourne,

36
00:01:27,623 --> 00:01:30,592
the therapist that we talked about.

37
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:34,996
That you agreed
to meet with, right, Shaun?

38
00:01:35,064 --> 00:01:36,831
Hi, Shaun. It's nice to meet you.

39
00:01:38,534 --> 00:01:39,968
H-H-Hi.

40
00:01:40,036 --> 00:01:41,570
Dr. Glassman thought
it would be a good idea

41
00:01:41,637 --> 00:01:43,926
for us to meet before
our first in-home session.

42
00:01:43,996 --> 00:01:47,184
- Just to make sure you're comfortable.
- I am not comfortable.

43
00:01:47,236 --> 00:01:49,704
Shaun

44
00:01:49,772 --> 00:01:50,939
It's gonna be fine.

45
00:01:51,007 --> 00:01:52,941
You two are going to like each other.

46
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:56,711
Dr. Bourne has a PhD
in cognitive psychology.

47
00:01:56,779 --> 00:01:59,180
She can really help you, but
you have to give her a chance.

48
00:02:03,252 --> 00:02:04,619
Okay?

49
00:02:07,189 --> 00:02:08,423
'Kay. Okay.

50
00:02:08,674 --> 00:02:10,768
I'm proud of you, Shaun.

51
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:12,827
I'm already proud of you.

52
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,074
AmericasCardroom.com brings poker back
Million Dollar Sunday Tournament every Sunday

54
00:02:36,434 --> 00:02:38,946
Notice the separation at zero degrees.

55
00:02:39,282 --> 00:02:42,791
It's indicative of complete
tears of the LCL and the UCL.

56
00:02:42,858 --> 00:02:44,793
A perfect candidate for surgery.

57
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,495
How's your mom? Still beating cancer?

58
00:02:47,563 --> 00:02:49,064
Oh, she's good, bro.

59
00:02:49,131 --> 00:02:50,999
She said she gets checked out
at the beach all the time

60
00:02:51,067 --> 00:02:52,667
ever since you did
her breast reconstruction.

61
00:02:52,735 --> 00:02:55,170
So, uh, thanks. I guess.

62
00:02:55,237 --> 00:02:57,439
We're gonna take good care of you.

63
00:02:57,506 --> 00:02:59,207
- See you in the O.R.
- Thank you.

64
00:02:59,275 --> 00:03:01,576
Which part of the UCL is the
principal secondary restraint

65
00:03:01,644 --> 00:03:03,078
to excessive valgus movement?

66
00:03:03,145 --> 00:03:04,913
- Anterior.
- Everything okay?

67
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,381
Yes, I'm fine.

68
00:03:07,817 --> 00:03:09,217
I'm fine.

69
00:03:12,154 --> 00:03:13,421
Squeeze my hands.

70
00:03:36,645 --> 00:03:41,416
There is a paradoxical loss
of grip strength on the left.

71
00:03:41,484 --> 00:03:45,053
There are many possible
explanations for that,

72
00:03:45,121 --> 00:03:47,989
one of which i... One of which is...

73
00:03:48,057 --> 00:03:49,657
he has ligament tears in his left arm.

74
00:03:49,725 --> 00:03:52,026
The anesthesiologist will be up in a few

75
00:03:52,094 --> 00:03:53,561
to get you ready for surgery.

76
00:03:53,629 --> 00:03:55,230
Dope. Thank you.

77
00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:02,837
Uh, Dr. Murphy.

78
00:04:02,905 --> 00:04:04,773
- What's wrong with you?
- N-Nothing.

79
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,369
I have a condition called...

80
00:04:07,431 --> 00:04:09,377
You're autistic.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Mm, I get it.

81
00:04:09,445 --> 00:04:11,946
But what is wrong with you, bro?

82
00:04:12,014 --> 00:04:15,817
You gotta be legit smart
to land a gig as a surgeon

83
00:04:15,885 --> 00:04:19,687
and he just shut you down like a noob.

84
00:04:19,755 --> 00:04:23,725
I'll bring the idea up again. I do that.

85
00:04:23,793 --> 00:04:25,226
They don't respect you.

86
00:04:26,896 --> 00:04:29,197
And they should listen to you
the first time.

87
00:04:29,265 --> 00:04:31,633
- I can't control what they do.
- Of course you can.

88
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,034
That's what playing the game
is all about.

89
00:04:33,102 --> 00:04:34,836
It's about controlling your opponent.

90
00:04:34,904 --> 00:04:36,437
You gotta find the right strategy.

91
00:04:36,505 --> 00:04:37,906
It is not a game.

92
00:04:37,973 --> 00:04:40,642
Everything's a game, man.
Everything's a game.

93
00:04:40,709 --> 00:04:42,277
Just sometimes the stakes are higher,

94
00:04:42,344 --> 00:04:44,813
and this time it's my arm.

95
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,451
So, I'm guessing
you drew the short straw.

96
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,346
- I beg your pardon?
- Well, you're here

97
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:58,326
and your co-residents
are on the VIP case.

98
00:04:58,394 --> 00:05:01,329
I'm awesome and I'd still rather
be with Melendez and Andrews.

99
00:05:01,397 --> 00:05:03,765
- No, it's fine...
- Relax. It's cool.

100
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:05,466
Tell me about our patient.

101
00:05:05,534 --> 00:05:07,535
Uh, 34-year-old female,
software engineer

102
00:05:07,603 --> 00:05:09,604
and entrepreneur presenting
with Compartment Syndrome

103
00:05:09,672 --> 00:05:12,106
caused by extreme overexertion
at a spin class.

104
00:05:12,174 --> 00:05:14,042
The condition has caused
the muscles in her legs to...

105
00:05:14,109 --> 00:05:15,944
- Okay. Great.
- I wasn't finished.

106
00:05:16,011 --> 00:05:18,279
Finished enough to show me
you're smart and thorough.

107
00:05:18,347 --> 00:05:19,414
You know the treatment plan?

108
00:05:19,481 --> 00:05:20,515
We need to make incisions on...

109
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:21,815
Good.

110
00:05:23,018 --> 00:05:24,786
You take lead.

111
00:05:32,528 --> 00:05:34,529
We need to make a number
of long incisions

112
00:05:34,597 --> 00:05:37,699
down both sides of each leg
to relieve the tension

113
00:05:37,766 --> 00:05:40,368
and return healthy circulation.

114
00:05:40,436 --> 00:05:41,803
It's important we act quickly.

115
00:05:41,871 --> 00:05:44,038
If we don't get the swelling
under control,

116
00:05:44,106 --> 00:05:45,807
the damage could be irreparable.

117
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:48,376
What does that mean?
I could lose my legs?

118
00:05:48,444 --> 00:05:50,278
From working out too hard
in a spin class?

119
00:05:50,346 --> 00:05:52,747
No, don't worry. Your sister's
gonna be just fine.

120
00:05:52,815 --> 00:05:55,183
Look, I'm very confident
we caught this in time.

121
00:05:56,619 --> 00:05:58,219
If you could lean forward?

122
00:05:58,287 --> 00:06:00,822
I just need to check your
kidneys haven't been affected.

123
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:03,491
Let me know if you have any tenderness.

124
00:06:10,232 --> 00:06:12,367
Extracting the palmaris now.

125
00:06:21,143 --> 00:06:23,912
Dr. Andrews, I read
your op-ed in Gen Surge News.

126
00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:25,980
Brilliant piece.

127
00:06:26,048 --> 00:06:28,283
Never realized the lack
of continuity of care

128
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,951
was such a severe problem.

129
00:06:32,254 --> 00:06:34,083
Dr. Melendez...

130
00:06:34,523 --> 00:06:36,424
you have very beautiful hair.

131
00:06:37,294 --> 00:06:39,093
Thank you.

132
00:06:39,161 --> 00:06:41,329
Given the patient's grip weakness,

133
00:06:41,397 --> 00:06:43,531
we could do a nerve conduction test

134
00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:45,733
to rule out any concurrent nerve damage.

135
00:06:45,801 --> 00:06:46,935
No.

136
00:06:49,138 --> 00:06:51,673
Okay, that looks like
a good stopping point.

137
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:54,475
Dr. Kalu... step in.

138
00:06:55,611 --> 00:06:58,012
- Something wrong?
- No, it looks good.

139
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,714
I just want to give Dr. Kalu
an opportunity

140
00:06:59,782 --> 00:07:01,282
to show us what he can do.

141
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,583
As long as that's okay with you.

142
00:07:03,585 --> 00:07:04,686
Sure.

143
00:07:04,753 --> 00:07:06,688
- Thank you, Dr. Andrews.
- Mm-hmm.

144
00:07:26,075 --> 00:07:28,743
All right, looking good.

145
00:07:28,811 --> 00:07:31,346
Let's move to the lateral side.

146
00:07:31,413 --> 00:07:33,448
So, what are we doing tonight, ladies?

147
00:07:33,515 --> 00:07:35,883
How about we go to Viva's?

148
00:07:35,951 --> 00:07:37,618
Sounds good.

149
00:07:37,686 --> 00:07:38,920
Bovie.

150
00:07:40,456 --> 00:07:42,357
You're awfully quiet over there,
Dr. Browne.

151
00:07:42,424 --> 00:07:43,992
I'm just focused.

152
00:07:44,059 --> 00:07:45,660
I know you're used
to operating with Melendez,

153
00:07:45,728 --> 00:07:48,262
but we have fun here.

154
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:49,797
I feel like when it's less tense,

155
00:07:49,865 --> 00:07:51,599
people make fewer mistakes.

156
00:07:51,667 --> 00:07:53,534
Okay.

157
00:07:53,602 --> 00:07:55,069
You wanna take the other leg?

158
00:07:55,784 --> 00:07:57,212
Really?

159
00:07:57,237 --> 00:07:59,374
Yeah, best way to learn
is by doing it, right?

160
00:07:59,441 --> 00:08:00,975
Definitely.

161
00:08:01,043 --> 00:08:02,043
So go for it.

162
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:04,272
_

163
00:09:40,102 --> 00:09:41,937
Shaun, good morning.

164
00:09:42,004 --> 00:09:44,039
Good morning, Dr. Glassman.

165
00:09:45,352 --> 00:09:46,986
How'd it go with Melissa?

166
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:48,798
She was...

167
00:09:48,865 --> 00:09:50,699
very helpful.

168
00:09:52,068 --> 00:09:54,036
You're wearing the same clothes
as yesterday, Shaun.

169
00:09:54,932 --> 00:09:57,033
After you.

170
00:10:04,848 --> 00:10:07,597
Apparently we are at an impasse.

171
00:10:07,851 --> 00:10:10,853
I feel strongly that Melissa
can be very helpful to you.

172
00:10:10,921 --> 00:10:13,422
You feel so strongly that she can't

173
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:14,557
that you're willing to sacrifice

174
00:10:14,624 --> 00:10:17,059
a good night's sleep and hygiene.

175
00:10:17,127 --> 00:10:19,094
Shaun, you smell.

176
00:10:22,866 --> 00:10:25,801
I will shower in the doctor's lounge.

177
00:10:25,869 --> 00:10:29,238
Well, great. That solves one problem.

178
00:10:29,306 --> 00:10:32,274
You stayed here all night
just to avoid a confrontation.

179
00:10:32,342 --> 00:10:34,343
Just say "no," Shaun.

180
00:10:34,411 --> 00:10:35,627
You know? Just say "no."

181
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:37,176
No!

182
00:10:37,835 --> 00:10:39,069
No.

183
00:10:39,136 --> 00:10:41,738
Great. That's just great.

184
00:10:41,806 --> 00:10:43,273
I don't have to see Melissa?

185
00:10:43,341 --> 00:10:45,775
No, you don't <i>have to see Melissa.</i>

186
00:10:45,843 --> 00:10:48,044
You're a grown man.
You can make your own decisions.

187
00:10:48,112 --> 00:10:51,548
I just happen to feel that she
could be of great help to you.

188
00:10:51,616 --> 00:10:53,214
That...

189
00:10:54,085 --> 00:10:56,520
I'll tell you what.

190
00:10:56,587 --> 00:10:58,154
You see Melissa three times

191
00:10:58,222 --> 00:11:00,457
and I will buy you
the surround-sound system

192
00:11:00,525 --> 00:11:02,359
you want for your television.

193
00:11:02,426 --> 00:11:03,627
Are you bribing me?

194
00:11:03,694 --> 00:11:05,962
I suppose I am.

195
00:11:07,698 --> 00:11:09,266
If you don't like her, she'll leave.

196
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:12,903
And I promise I will never say
another word about it.

197
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:14,905
That's a pretty good deal.

198
00:11:20,344 --> 00:11:21,511
Okay.

199
00:11:21,579 --> 00:11:23,079
Okay.

200
00:11:24,815 --> 00:11:26,616
I will meet with her tonight.

201
00:11:26,684 --> 00:11:28,351
That's good, Shaun.

202
00:11:40,115 --> 00:11:43,250
Saline? I've never seen it
done quite like that.

203
00:11:43,334 --> 00:11:45,969
Yeah, I had a professor from Portugal.

204
00:11:46,037 --> 00:11:49,239
Apparently it's how they do it
over there.

205
00:11:49,307 --> 00:11:51,174
It's supposed to lessen the pain.

206
00:11:51,242 --> 00:11:53,143
Well, the good news is
your tissue is nice and pink,

207
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:54,578
which means it's healthy.

208
00:11:54,645 --> 00:11:56,046
Unfortunately, the swelling is not

209
00:11:56,113 --> 00:11:57,614
coming down like we'd hoped.

210
00:11:57,682 --> 00:12:00,050
Does this mean you're going
to have to amputate?

211
00:12:00,117 --> 00:12:02,352
No, no. Sometimes it just takes time.

212
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,353
We'll take care of you.

213
00:12:05,189 --> 00:12:07,490
Very nice work, Dr. Browne.

214
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,101
Hey.

215
00:12:18,169 --> 00:12:20,971
Can you do me a solid
and trade patients?

216
00:12:21,038 --> 00:12:23,440
No, not a chance.
Andrews let me take lead.

217
00:12:23,507 --> 00:12:25,308
Coyle let me take lead, too.

218
00:12:25,376 --> 00:12:27,644
So what is the problem?

219
00:12:27,712 --> 00:12:29,679
He's a little too friendly.

220
00:12:32,249 --> 00:12:33,984
He patted my back in a weird way.

221
00:12:34,051 --> 00:12:35,785
I don't know. It was... It was awkward.

222
00:12:35,853 --> 00:12:37,854
I'm sure he's just trying
to establish a rapport.

223
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,690
Maybe?

224
00:12:40,758 --> 00:12:42,826
I don't...

225
00:12:42,893 --> 00:12:44,728
Shaun? Switch?

226
00:12:44,795 --> 00:12:46,196
No.

227
00:12:46,263 --> 00:12:47,897
I like Bobby.

228
00:12:47,965 --> 00:12:50,100
He has very good advice.

229
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,072
So, who did what?

230
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,941
Well, I did, uh, most of the surgery

231
00:12:58,009 --> 00:12:59,193
along with Dr. Andrews

232
00:12:59,247 --> 00:13:01,878
and Dr. Kalu aided in replacing
one of your torn ligaments.

233
00:13:01,946 --> 00:13:04,314
You should be back in competition
shape in a few weeks time.

234
00:13:04,382 --> 00:13:05,927
Word.

235
00:13:05,997 --> 00:13:07,851
What about you? What'd you do?

236
00:13:07,918 --> 00:13:11,755
I helped to clean the grafted tendons.

237
00:13:11,822 --> 00:13:13,757
Ah. That's it.

238
00:13:13,824 --> 00:13:15,725
Yes.

239
00:13:15,793 --> 00:13:17,160
Come on. You didn't get up in there?

240
00:13:21,599 --> 00:13:25,402
Y-Your muscle weakness

241
00:13:25,469 --> 00:13:28,338
along with the high body temperature

242
00:13:28,406 --> 00:13:31,775
could be an early indicator
of multiple sclerosis.

243
00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:36,686
We should order an MRI.

244
00:13:36,741 --> 00:13:38,936
We have talked about this
countless times.

245
00:13:38,999 --> 00:13:41,634
Yes. We should order an MRI.

246
00:13:41,701 --> 00:13:43,302
We are not ordering an MRI.

247
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:44,703
You don't respect me.

248
00:13:44,771 --> 00:13:46,205
Not right now, I don't.

249
00:13:46,272 --> 00:13:48,107
Dr. Andrews, Dr. Melendez.

250
00:13:48,174 --> 00:13:49,675
Given the fact we're dealing
with a pro athlete,

251
00:13:49,743 --> 00:13:51,877
even the slightest hiccup
could be problematic.

252
00:13:52,046 --> 00:13:55,515
I think Bobby would be impressed
by our being extra attentive.

253
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:58,117
Kalu is right... he is a pro athlete

254
00:13:58,184 --> 00:13:59,485
in his prime earning years.

255
00:13:59,552 --> 00:14:02,721
We should make sure we leave him 100%.

256
00:14:06,893 --> 00:14:07,993
Do the MRI.

257
00:14:12,766 --> 00:14:15,467
Nice score. You got 'em to listen.

258
00:14:15,535 --> 00:14:17,202
Do the MRI.

259
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:20,139
No, Jared did.

260
00:14:20,206 --> 00:14:22,541
How did he get there when you couldn't?

261
00:14:22,609 --> 00:14:24,176
He asked nicely.

262
00:14:24,244 --> 00:14:26,145
Okay, you asked nicely.

263
00:14:26,212 --> 00:14:29,481
Yes. Yes, I did.

264
00:14:29,549 --> 00:14:31,950
You gotta be fierce
if you want the glory, bro.

265
00:14:32,018 --> 00:14:33,318
Oh, no.

266
00:14:33,386 --> 00:14:35,888
I do not want the glory, bro.

267
00:14:35,955 --> 00:14:38,557
I just want to be a good surgeon.

268
00:14:38,632 --> 00:14:39,965
Everyone wants glory.

269
00:14:40,026 --> 00:14:41,694
It... It's how you get what you want.

270
00:14:41,761 --> 00:14:44,697
And everybody's got wants.

271
00:14:44,764 --> 00:14:49,301
I want a surround-sound speaker system.

272
00:14:51,004 --> 00:14:52,938
To get it, I have to see a therapist.

273
00:14:53,006 --> 00:14:55,207
I don't want to have to see a therapist.

274
00:14:55,275 --> 00:14:59,445
Okay, yeah, that's...
that's how I got my first PS2.

275
00:14:59,512 --> 00:15:01,313
Yeah, my parents bribed me
to go to therapy

276
00:15:01,381 --> 00:15:02,648
after they split up.

277
00:15:02,716 --> 00:15:04,516
What was therapy like?

278
00:15:04,584 --> 00:15:05,484
Pretty basic, bro.

279
00:15:05,552 --> 00:15:06,585
She'd tell me what to do,

280
00:15:06,653 --> 00:15:07,619
how to deal with my parents.

281
00:15:07,687 --> 00:15:08,854
Was it helpful?

282
00:15:08,922 --> 00:15:10,122
I don't know.

283
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:12,758
I never did anything she told me to do.

284
00:15:12,826 --> 00:15:15,194
Is that an option?

285
00:15:15,261 --> 00:15:17,696
Doing whatever the hell
you feel like doing

286
00:15:17,764 --> 00:15:19,431
is <i>always</i> an option.

287
00:15:25,601 --> 00:15:28,674
Just a gentle reminder...

288
00:15:28,742 --> 00:15:30,209
dinner with my dad tonight at 8:00.

289
00:15:30,276 --> 00:15:31,577
It is on my calendar.

290
00:15:31,644 --> 00:15:33,011
So was the Gypsy Kings concert,

291
00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:34,913
and I... I seem to remember...

292
00:15:34,981 --> 00:15:36,949
Fair enough.

293
00:15:37,016 --> 00:15:39,218
How is the VIP case?

294
00:15:39,285 --> 00:15:42,020
Shaun seems off about something.

295
00:15:42,088 --> 00:15:43,213
Did you talk to him?

296
00:15:43,252 --> 00:15:45,390
Yes. Because talking
to Shaun solves problems.

297
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:47,092
And Andrews is...

298
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,594
He's a pain in your ass.

299
00:15:48,661 --> 00:15:51,130
No. He's actually too friendly.

300
00:15:51,197 --> 00:15:53,832
Jared kisses his ass
and suddenly he's cutting.

301
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:57,336
Well, ass kissing
is a useful skill for a surgeon.

302
00:15:57,403 --> 00:15:58,771
That's a very beautiful blouse.

303
00:15:58,838 --> 00:16:00,038
Do I still have to go to dinner?

304
00:16:00,106 --> 00:16:01,440
Yes. It'll be nice.

305
00:16:01,508 --> 00:16:04,309
You'll have some nice wine
and my dad will pay.

306
00:16:04,377 --> 00:16:05,911
He'll push us to set a wedding date.

307
00:16:05,979 --> 00:16:06,910
April 25th.

308
00:16:07,069 --> 00:16:09,270
- Did you book something?
- No.

309
00:16:09,415 --> 00:16:12,785
But my dad doesn't need to know that.

310
00:16:15,655 --> 00:16:17,055
What do you got?

311
00:16:17,123 --> 00:16:19,925
Looks like the surgically
repaired elbow is fine.

312
00:16:19,993 --> 00:16:21,126
As I suspected.

313
00:16:21,194 --> 00:16:23,162
But Murphy noticed something
in the periphery,

314
00:16:23,229 --> 00:16:24,963
a little higher up,
just above the bicep.

315
00:16:25,031 --> 00:16:26,799
It was my idea.

316
00:16:26,866 --> 00:16:29,301
Yes, I just said that.

317
00:16:29,369 --> 00:16:32,704
So, we took an image from
higher up and noticed this.

318
00:16:34,774 --> 00:16:38,310
It's encasing the entirety
of his brachial plexus.

319
00:16:43,016 --> 00:16:44,750
This thing is massive.

320
00:16:44,818 --> 00:16:47,052
Biopsy indicated
it's definitely a schwannoma.

321
00:16:47,119 --> 00:16:49,520
And it's definitely malignant.

322
00:16:49,589 --> 00:16:52,391
It's in a tricky spot, but you
might be able to remove it.

323
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:55,727
Follow it up with a combo
of radiotherapy and chemo

324
00:16:55,795 --> 00:16:56,895
to finish it off...

325
00:16:59,032 --> 00:17:00,693
What? What's the problem?

326
00:17:00,794 --> 00:17:04,102
Robert Ato. Bobby Ato.
Pro-gamer Bobby Ato?

327
00:17:04,127 --> 00:17:05,146
You a fan?

328
00:17:05,171 --> 00:17:06,505
I met three years ago.

329
00:17:06,573 --> 00:17:08,774
Oncology consult for SF Muni.

330
00:17:11,324 --> 00:17:13,658
He had cancer three years ago?

331
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:22,319
Why the hell wouldn't you tell us
that you had already had cancer?

332
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:24,038
It was in my lower leg three years ago.

333
00:17:24,093 --> 00:17:26,206
How's that gonna change
how you fix my elbow?

334
00:17:26,261 --> 00:17:28,307
It would have a huge effect
on how I viewed the symptoms

335
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:29,675
that Dr. Murphy noticed.

336
00:17:29,714 --> 00:17:31,499
You didn't listen to Dr. Murphy

337
00:17:31,566 --> 00:17:32,943
because you don't respect him.

338
00:17:33,006 --> 00:17:34,173
'Cause Dr. Murphy is different.

339
00:17:34,241 --> 00:17:35,441
I respect him.

340
00:17:35,509 --> 00:17:37,343
He has good ideas, and he has bad ideas.

341
00:17:37,412 --> 00:17:39,403
Turns out this was a good one.
That you shot down.

342
00:17:39,505 --> 00:17:42,573
Why did you hide the truth?

343
00:17:42,641 --> 00:17:45,910
A previous cancer diagnosis
isn't shameful.

344
00:17:53,419 --> 00:17:55,620
After the first diagnosis,

345
00:17:55,688 --> 00:17:58,990
all I was thinking was,
"Will it come back?

346
00:17:59,058 --> 00:18:01,526
How bad will it be?"

347
00:18:01,593 --> 00:18:02,979
I was distracted, man.

348
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,385
I couldn't focus, and I hit a slump...

349
00:18:05,448 --> 00:18:06,464
Wait, you were worried that cancer

350
00:18:06,532 --> 00:18:09,588
- was messing with your gaming?
- Yeah, man!

351
00:18:09,835 --> 00:18:11,469
It cost me a championship.

352
00:18:11,537 --> 00:18:14,405
I decided to block it out
along with all the thoughts

353
00:18:14,473 --> 00:18:16,240
of negativity and physical weakness,

354
00:18:16,308 --> 00:18:19,977
and like that,
I became the best in the world.

355
00:18:23,816 --> 00:18:26,884
We need to do a full-body scan

356
00:18:26,952 --> 00:18:29,821
to make sure the cancer
has not already metastasized.

357
00:18:29,888 --> 00:18:32,156
What he said.

358
00:18:35,127 --> 00:18:36,961
What I said.

359
00:18:38,163 --> 00:18:40,064
This looks great.

360
00:18:40,139 --> 00:18:42,307
The swelling is starting to reduce.

361
00:18:42,367 --> 00:18:43,988
We can start tightening the sutures.

362
00:18:44,034 --> 00:18:47,472
Finally some good news.

363
00:18:47,539 --> 00:18:49,240
You look like
you're doing better, too...

364
00:18:49,308 --> 00:18:51,909
now your boss is gone.

365
00:18:51,991 --> 00:18:54,915
Dr. Coyle? He's fine.

366
00:18:55,154 --> 00:18:56,988
You don't have to toe
the party line with me.

367
00:18:57,049 --> 00:18:59,083
Trust me. I get it.

368
00:18:59,151 --> 00:19:02,253
I almost rode myself to death
in a spin class

369
00:19:02,321 --> 00:19:03,988
because I overheard
a couple of investors say

370
00:19:04,056 --> 00:19:07,091
that they "liked the concept just fine,"

371
00:19:07,159 --> 00:19:09,694
but that my cankles
were "too distracting."

372
00:19:09,762 --> 00:19:12,663
What? Your idea is brilliant.

373
00:19:12,731 --> 00:19:15,333
And you're beautiful.
Screw those jackasses.

374
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,235
Grace, you don't get it.

375
00:19:17,302 --> 00:19:20,138
You got the face, perfect little
hip-to-waist ratio,

376
00:19:20,205 --> 00:19:22,807
and most VC firms
are run by a bunch of bros,

377
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:24,408
so there is an inverse relationship

378
00:19:24,476 --> 00:19:27,378
between the size of my ass
and how much money I can raise.

379
00:19:27,579 --> 00:19:28,806
Then you should do something else

380
00:19:28,868 --> 00:19:30,581
where you don't have to deal with bros.

381
00:19:30,649 --> 00:19:32,216
Like what, become a nun?

382
00:19:34,052 --> 00:19:36,020
- Sorry.
- You agree with her?

383
00:19:36,088 --> 00:19:37,522
She nearly worked herself to death

384
00:19:37,589 --> 00:19:39,724
trying to please some pigs with money?

385
00:19:39,792 --> 00:19:40,925
She shouldn't have to.

386
00:19:40,993 --> 00:19:42,827
Great. Let me know when you find utopia.

387
00:19:42,895 --> 00:19:45,696
But until then, I love what I do.

388
00:19:45,764 --> 00:19:48,432
So I got to play the game
'cause if I call them out,

389
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:52,603
I just get labeled a "bitch,"
or even worse.

390
00:19:52,671 --> 00:19:54,872
Your heart rate's going up.

391
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,140
Hazel?

392
00:19:56,617 --> 00:19:58,543
Hazel?

393
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:00,478
She's barely moving any air.

394
00:20:00,546 --> 00:20:02,180
Hazel, can you hear me?

395
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:04,399
Code blue! I need to intubate her.

396
00:20:04,437 --> 00:20:06,213
- Give me a laryngoscope and an ET tube.
<i>- Code blue.</i>

397
00:20:06,284 --> 00:20:08,487
- Let's get her on 100% oxygen.
- <i>4 North, room 407.</i>

398
00:20:08,585 --> 00:20:11,284
<i>Code blue. 4 North, room 407.</i>

399
00:20:14,726 --> 00:20:16,761
- Talk to me.
- Her lungs...

400
00:20:16,829 --> 00:20:19,063
I think it's a reperfusion injury.

401
00:20:19,131 --> 00:20:21,132
There's no room in here.

402
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,678
Mallampati 3, maybe 4.
You should take over.

403
00:20:23,763 --> 00:20:26,470
You're doing fine. Here, use the bougie.

404
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:33,044
- You feel the epiglottis?
- I think so.

405
00:20:33,111 --> 00:20:35,213
Okay, go a bit further,
you should feel it stop.

406
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,747
If it keeps going,
you're in the esophagus.

407
00:20:36,815 --> 00:20:38,983
It stopped, got it. ET tube?

408
00:20:42,821 --> 00:20:44,956
It's gonna be okay.

409
00:20:49,595 --> 00:20:50,761
Strong work, Doctor.

410
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,435
Best in the world or not,
this guy's insane.

411
00:20:57,502 --> 00:21:00,062
Hiding from a diagnosis?

412
00:21:00,305 --> 00:21:03,312
Doesn't work... it'll find you.

413
00:21:04,283 --> 00:21:08,152
Bobby wanted to be the best.
He is the best.

414
00:21:08,213 --> 00:21:09,513
I don't think he was
trying to be the best.

415
00:21:09,581 --> 00:21:10,715
I think he was just scared.

416
00:21:10,782 --> 00:21:13,584
What's that? Next to the brain stem.

417
00:21:18,356 --> 00:21:21,192
Oh, another schwannoma.

418
00:21:22,628 --> 00:21:25,062
So much for the power
of positive thinking.

419
00:21:32,185 --> 00:21:34,820
He's a strange kid. He had cancer.

420
00:21:34,888 --> 00:21:37,323
Stopped going to follow-ups
because he started losing.

421
00:21:37,391 --> 00:21:38,491
What's so strange?

422
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,760
Sounds like a classic case of denial.

423
00:21:41,894 --> 00:21:43,254
I was thinking we could try
something new.

424
00:21:43,316 --> 00:21:44,583
Maybe gamma knife?

425
00:21:44,608 --> 00:21:47,210
I don't think so.
Wrong type of tumor for that.

426
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,593
What if I told you every few months

427
00:21:50,618 --> 00:21:54,287
that you had a real possibility
you were gonna die?

428
00:21:54,704 --> 00:21:57,699
I'd be scared. And I'd listen.

429
00:21:57,767 --> 00:22:00,202
Maybe you would, maybe you wouldn't.

430
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,403
Personally, I think he's right...

431
00:22:01,471 --> 00:22:02,938
shut down those voices of doom,

432
00:22:03,006 --> 00:22:05,407
spend your days living instead of dying.

433
00:22:05,475 --> 00:22:07,209
But he may also be crazy.

434
00:22:09,612 --> 00:22:10,813
Short of making him a vegetable,

435
00:22:10,859 --> 00:22:12,881
I don't know if there's anything
we can do.

436
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,521
Is... Is Shaun okay?

437
00:22:21,558 --> 00:22:22,791
Is his work okay?

438
00:22:22,859 --> 00:22:24,092
Yes, I just, um...

439
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,460
Then he's fine.

440
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:47,015
Damn.

441
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:48,217
Horse walks into a bar.

442
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:50,919
Bartender says...

443
00:22:51,761 --> 00:22:53,361
We found another mass.

444
00:22:54,029 --> 00:22:57,092
That's not how it goes, but cool.

445
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,260
Let's knock it out, too.

446
00:22:58,328 --> 00:23:00,295
The mass is located on your brain stem.

447
00:23:00,363 --> 00:23:03,265
Which controls
your autonomic nervous system...

448
00:23:03,333 --> 00:23:05,767
your heart, respiration.

449
00:23:05,835 --> 00:23:08,537
Its positioning makes it inoperable.

450
00:23:19,048 --> 00:23:22,282
I...had a good run.

451
00:23:23,887 --> 00:23:27,841
Wish it was longer, but...

452
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:31,593
I'm gonna go out on top.

453
00:23:34,063 --> 00:23:36,425
If you went out today,

454
00:23:36,866 --> 00:23:39,457
could you say the same thing?

455
00:23:50,761 --> 00:23:52,929
She's lucky you were there.

456
00:23:53,049 --> 00:23:55,684
Me? You're the one who saved her.

457
00:23:55,752 --> 00:23:57,853
With your help. A lot of it.

458
00:23:57,921 --> 00:23:59,721
So, thank you.

459
00:24:02,659 --> 00:24:04,927
Hey, look, you wanna...
you wanna get a drink?

460
00:24:04,994 --> 00:24:06,194
Maybe take the edge off?

461
00:24:06,262 --> 00:24:09,364
No. But thank you, though.

462
00:24:09,432 --> 00:24:12,301
Are you sure? I promise you'll have fun.

463
00:24:12,368 --> 00:24:14,703
I give great massages.

464
00:24:14,771 --> 00:24:16,738
And I'll make a killer omelet
in the morning.

465
00:24:18,675 --> 00:24:20,709
That's really inappropriate.

466
00:24:20,777 --> 00:24:22,711
I said no.

467
00:24:23,368 --> 00:24:25,447
I'm sorry. W-W...
Where's this coming from?

468
00:24:25,515 --> 00:24:27,182
You were... You were clearly
giving me signals.

469
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:28,450
No, the only "signal" I gave you

470
00:24:28,518 --> 00:24:31,168
was that I wasn't interested
in the slightest.

471
00:24:31,621 --> 00:24:33,488
Okay, see, I just...
I heard about you and Kalu

472
00:24:33,556 --> 00:24:35,190
banging in the call room,
so I figured...

473
00:24:35,258 --> 00:24:37,559
This conversation is over.
You're an ass.

474
00:24:37,801 --> 00:24:39,528
I'm pretty easygoing,

475
00:24:39,564 --> 00:24:41,198
but you're approaching insubordination.

476
00:24:43,145 --> 00:24:44,646
You're gonna report <i>me?</i>

477
00:24:44,767 --> 00:24:46,768
I'm not gonna report anybody.

478
00:24:46,836 --> 00:24:48,136
But maybe next time, try not to have

479
00:24:48,204 --> 00:24:50,806
such a stick up your ass
about being asked out.

480
00:24:57,747 --> 00:24:58,814
Oh, come on.

481
00:24:58,881 --> 00:25:00,749
I always thought Bunny
was the cutest nickname.

482
00:25:00,817 --> 00:25:02,718
Of course you did, but you
could've stopped calling me that

483
00:25:02,785 --> 00:25:05,136
when I was 12 or... or 20.

484
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:08,991
Rough day?

485
00:25:11,561 --> 00:25:14,596
Yeah. Yeah, it was something.

486
00:25:14,664 --> 00:25:17,399
Well, this should make you
a little happier.

487
00:25:17,467 --> 00:25:20,969
I have decided to take care
of your entire wedding.

488
00:25:21,037 --> 00:25:22,504
We don't need it.

489
00:25:23,921 --> 00:25:25,254
You're welcome.

490
00:25:25,314 --> 00:25:26,439
We're not 21.

491
00:25:26,527 --> 00:25:29,144
We're more than capable
of paying for our own wedding.

492
00:25:29,212 --> 00:25:30,912
We make good money.

493
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:33,949
But you won't once you start
having kids, Bunny.

494
00:25:49,098 --> 00:25:52,070
What are you doing in here?

495
00:25:52,735 --> 00:25:55,023
I'm hiding from my therapist.

496
00:25:55,838 --> 00:25:59,975
I am not going to get
a surround-sound speaker system.

497
00:26:00,043 --> 00:26:02,844
But I am doing whatever
the hell I feel like doing.

498
00:26:02,912 --> 00:26:04,046
Mm-hmm.

499
00:26:04,113 --> 00:26:05,714
Can you hand me that mop?

500
00:26:05,782 --> 00:26:07,249
Hmm, okay.

501
00:26:13,432 --> 00:26:17,435
Are you satisfied with what
you've done with your life?

502
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:22,139
Would you be happy if you died tomorrow?

503
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:25,000
Uh, satisfied?

504
00:26:25,068 --> 00:26:27,135
Happy?

505
00:26:27,332 --> 00:26:31,482
I mean, I clean up a building, uh...

506
00:26:32,141 --> 00:26:34,342
But I... I married the love of my life.

507
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:38,346
Uh, we raised three beautiful kids.

508
00:26:38,414 --> 00:26:42,591
One of them had some troubles,
but she's doing great now.

509
00:26:43,052 --> 00:26:46,153
The other two are doing
all right for themselves.

510
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:48,523
And I was good to people.

511
00:26:48,591 --> 00:26:50,692
At least I think I was.

512
00:26:53,062 --> 00:26:55,363
That's a very good answer.

513
00:26:59,135 --> 00:27:01,303
I got pictures of the girls
if you want see...

514
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:02,804
No.

515
00:27:04,507 --> 00:27:07,242
So, why do I need to quit my job
to have a family?

516
00:27:07,303 --> 00:27:08,406
Agreed.

517
00:27:08,514 --> 00:27:10,715
She can be a great lawyer
and a great mom.

518
00:27:10,782 --> 00:27:13,350
Yes, she can, but why?

519
00:27:13,583 --> 00:27:16,847
W-Why waste your time working?

520
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:18,979
You should be enjoying life, like me.

521
00:27:19,065 --> 00:27:20,655
There's plenty in the family trust.

522
00:27:20,715 --> 00:27:23,250
Dad, my work is important.
I'm helping people...

523
00:27:23,326 --> 00:27:25,894
Bunny... you're pushing papers.

524
00:27:25,949 --> 00:27:28,207
How... How is that really
helping anyone?

525
00:27:28,301 --> 00:27:30,165
And maybe I'm old-fashioned,
but I don't get it.

526
00:27:30,233 --> 00:27:31,910
I-I thought you were smarter than that.

527
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,668
You'd prefer her to be a lazy parasite

528
00:27:33,736 --> 00:27:35,012
living off a trust fund

529
00:27:35,069 --> 00:27:37,437
as opposed to actually
contributing to society?

530
00:27:37,607 --> 00:27:39,007
Parasite?

531
00:27:40,965 --> 00:27:43,267
My father made a lot of money.

532
00:27:43,318 --> 00:27:45,412
I'm not going to apologize for that.

533
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:47,564
He made sure his children
and his grandchildren

534
00:27:47,632 --> 00:27:50,000
could enjoy their lives.

535
00:27:50,053 --> 00:27:51,281
I'm not hurting anyone.

536
00:27:51,384 --> 00:27:55,078
In fact, I go out of my way
to help people.

537
00:27:55,259 --> 00:27:57,927
So I'm sorry if that doesn't qualify me

538
00:27:58,074 --> 00:28:00,241
as a worthwhile person in your book.

539
00:28:03,083 --> 00:28:04,751
I'll get the check on my way out.

540
00:28:04,912 --> 00:28:07,377
Dad, you don't have to...

541
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:34,437
What am I doing wrong, Shaun?

542
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:37,748
I don't know.

543
00:28:41,706 --> 00:28:43,247
I tried...

544
00:28:44,956 --> 00:28:46,890
encouraging,
I've tried being supportive,

545
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:48,379
I've tried bribing you.

546
00:28:48,449 --> 00:28:52,262
I don't need a therapist. No.

547
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:54,331
Look around you.
What... You're sleeping...

548
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,100
What is this, a broom closet?

549
00:28:57,296 --> 00:29:00,165
Look at the sacrifices
you're willing to make

550
00:29:00,232 --> 00:29:02,167
just to avoid...

551
00:29:09,041 --> 00:29:10,909
We're gonna pick this up later.

552
00:29:14,513 --> 00:29:16,581
You have to file a complaint with HR.

553
00:29:16,649 --> 00:29:19,751
I do that and I get labeled
"hostile" and "difficult,"

554
00:29:19,818 --> 00:29:22,153
neither of which work
with my complexion or gender.

555
00:29:22,221 --> 00:29:23,855
All the more reason to take a stand.

556
00:29:23,923 --> 00:29:26,324
Claire, this situation
is exactly what HR is for.

557
00:29:26,392 --> 00:29:27,859
I didn't say it was easy.

558
00:29:27,927 --> 00:29:29,127
Yeah, you did.

559
00:29:29,195 --> 00:29:31,162
Look, it's scary and it takes courage,

560
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:33,464
- but it's the right thing to do.
- It's a pointless thing to do.

561
00:29:33,532 --> 00:29:36,100
- They'll listen to you.
- They will shift the blame onto me.

562
00:29:36,168 --> 00:29:37,902
Like you did.

563
00:29:37,977 --> 00:29:39,144
Whoa, what? How did I...

564
00:29:39,205 --> 00:29:41,140
I came to you,
you accused me of exaggerating

565
00:29:41,171 --> 00:29:42,207
to get back onto the case.

566
00:29:42,274 --> 00:29:43,875
No, no, no, that's not
what I meant. I had no idea...

567
00:29:43,943 --> 00:29:45,443
I said he was too friendly.

568
00:29:45,511 --> 00:29:48,479
You said he was "trying
to establish a rapport."

569
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,749
I'm sleeping with you, Jared,

570
00:29:51,817 --> 00:29:53,384
and you thought I was overreacting.

571
00:29:53,452 --> 00:29:56,087
How do you think three strangers
will see things?

572
00:30:01,026 --> 00:30:03,187
Claire, I'm sorry. I am so sorry.

573
00:30:03,266 --> 00:30:05,330
Don't worry about it.
It's just the way it is.

574
00:30:05,397 --> 00:30:07,065
I've got a patient to round on.

575
00:30:09,335 --> 00:30:12,003
Dr. Melendez and I had a talk

576
00:30:12,071 --> 00:30:14,539
and we believe we can excise the tumor

577
00:30:14,607 --> 00:30:17,075
if you're willing to make a sacrifice.

578
00:30:17,142 --> 00:30:19,143
Sacrifice?

579
00:30:20,045 --> 00:30:21,246
That sounds better than death.

580
00:30:21,313 --> 00:30:23,574
My thinking as well.

581
00:30:23,882 --> 00:30:25,950
We believe we can remove the mass,

582
00:30:26,018 --> 00:30:29,254
but we'll also have to take
a piece out of your brain stem.

583
00:30:29,321 --> 00:30:30,688
A chunk of the red nucleus,

584
00:30:30,756 --> 00:30:33,691
which helps control
the left side of your body.

585
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:36,694
You'll be paralyzed on that side.

586
00:30:36,762 --> 00:30:38,763
It could also result in difficulty

587
00:30:38,831 --> 00:30:40,999
eating and swallowing.

588
00:30:41,066 --> 00:30:43,101
Speech difficulties.

589
00:30:47,339 --> 00:30:48,806
Let's do it.

590
00:30:48,874 --> 00:30:50,475
Good for you.

591
00:30:52,411 --> 00:30:53,978
Hold on. Hold on.

592
00:30:54,046 --> 00:30:56,714
Bobby, this is very risky surgery.

593
00:30:56,782 --> 00:30:59,450
You could die on the table,
and even if all goes well,

594
00:30:59,518 --> 00:31:01,352
you will be severely disabled.

595
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:04,455
Yeah, I... I was listening, and I'm in.

596
00:31:13,666 --> 00:31:17,168
Guys, hey, I get it.

597
00:31:17,236 --> 00:31:20,772
If I'm dead, I'm... I'm dead.

598
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:26,177
But if not... PT,
relearning stuff, whatever.

599
00:31:26,245 --> 00:31:29,580
It's not gonna stop me from competing.

600
00:31:29,648 --> 00:31:31,883
Not ever.

601
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:35,594
Bobby, your career is over.

602
00:31:35,703 --> 00:31:37,288
We need you to understand that.

603
00:31:44,997 --> 00:31:46,197
Yeah?

604
00:31:54,873 --> 00:31:57,108
Once a gamer, always a gamer, huh?

605
00:31:58,711 --> 00:32:00,645
You got my respect.

606
00:32:18,364 --> 00:32:19,430
What the hell is your problem?

607
00:32:19,498 --> 00:32:21,032
If you ever threaten Claire,

608
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,331
take a disrespectful tone,

609
00:32:22,394 --> 00:32:24,635
or so much as look at her
cross-eyed again,

610
00:32:24,703 --> 00:32:26,104
I'm gonna do a hell of a lot more

611
00:32:26,171 --> 00:32:27,638
than put you up against a wall.

612
00:32:27,706 --> 00:32:29,006
We clear?

613
00:32:41,068 --> 00:32:44,555
Your lungs are looking a lot better.

614
00:32:44,623 --> 00:32:48,693
Overall, you're in pretty good shape.

615
00:32:55,008 --> 00:32:56,576
Thank you.

616
00:32:56,668 --> 00:32:58,269
You're welcome.

617
00:32:58,337 --> 00:33:00,838
All part of the service.

618
00:33:00,906 --> 00:33:04,243
And good for you.

619
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:07,445
I wasn't sleeping.

620
00:33:07,513 --> 00:33:10,214
I heard the way
you handled that other doctor.

621
00:33:12,151 --> 00:33:15,086
You heard that? All of it?

622
00:33:16,789 --> 00:33:18,814
I wish I had done that.

623
00:33:19,224 --> 00:33:20,658
You were brave.

624
00:33:20,726 --> 00:33:23,220
No, no.

625
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:26,330
If I was brave, I...

626
00:33:35,374 --> 00:33:37,742
Rick Allen.

627
00:33:37,786 --> 00:33:39,871
- Who?
- One-armed drummer for Def Leppard.

628
00:33:39,942 --> 00:33:41,212
Come on, man.

629
00:33:41,287 --> 00:33:44,756
And there is the tumor capsule.

630
00:33:44,817 --> 00:33:47,685
Richie Parker. Anyone?

631
00:33:47,753 --> 00:33:50,721
Isn't he a NASCAR guy?
An engineer, right?

632
00:33:50,789 --> 00:33:51,889
Born without arms?

633
00:33:51,957 --> 00:33:54,959
And Nurse Ocampo gets the door prize.

634
00:33:55,027 --> 00:33:57,562
And now we will take just a little piece

635
00:33:57,629 --> 00:34:01,866
of our friend here...
a nice sample to test.

636
00:34:01,934 --> 00:34:03,468
Thank you, Doctor.

637
00:34:03,535 --> 00:34:04,702
And now the rest.

638
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:06,337
He may not be able to tie his own shoes,

639
00:34:06,405 --> 00:34:09,607
but I wouldn't bet against him
ever competing again.

640
00:34:09,675 --> 00:34:13,010
<i>Aut libertatem aut mortem mihi da.</i>

641
00:34:13,078 --> 00:34:14,479
Shaun, do you know that means?

642
00:34:14,546 --> 00:34:18,149
No. It's not relevant to this surgery.

643
00:34:18,217 --> 00:34:20,284
Oh, it's relevant. Look it up.

644
00:34:20,352 --> 00:34:21,486
No, it's not.

645
00:34:21,553 --> 00:34:26,190
Heart rate and ETCO2 are rising.

646
00:34:26,258 --> 00:34:27,959
Slight change in body temperature.

647
00:34:28,026 --> 00:34:29,193
His heart rate's 108.

648
00:34:29,261 --> 00:34:30,795
Check tube placement and suction him.

649
00:34:30,863 --> 00:34:33,259
If he takes a turn,
we might have to abort.

650
00:34:33,337 --> 00:34:35,233
I don't think so. I'm too far in.

651
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,334
Keep him stable.

652
00:34:36,401 --> 00:34:37,768
He's tachy. Heart rate's climbing.

653
00:34:37,836 --> 00:34:41,372
115, 117, 120, and rising.

654
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,442
He is going into v-tach.

655
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:46,070
Robert Ato is dying.

656
00:34:49,959 --> 00:34:52,638
- I'm gonna pull out of the pons slowly.
- Well, hold on.

657
00:34:52,726 --> 00:34:54,881
You pull out now, you might
damage the cerebellar peduncle.

658
00:34:54,937 --> 00:34:57,672
If I don't get out now,
I'll kill him if he starts seizing.

659
00:34:57,731 --> 00:34:59,933
Something's not right. Tachycardia?

660
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,835
Bradycardia would make more sense.

661
00:35:04,171 --> 00:35:05,872
- Ideas.
- Anyone?

662
00:35:07,975 --> 00:35:09,042
Tell me what you see.

663
00:35:09,109 --> 00:35:12,145
Tachycardia, rising body
temperature again,

664
00:35:12,213 --> 00:35:14,948
muscle rigidity, CO2 is rising.

665
00:35:15,015 --> 00:35:16,416
Muscle rigidity? Which side?

666
00:35:16,484 --> 00:35:17,684
It's all over.

667
00:35:17,751 --> 00:35:19,018
Then it's not the brain stem.

668
00:35:19,086 --> 00:35:20,920
We'd only have muscle rigidity
on one side.

669
00:35:20,988 --> 00:35:25,442
Think. Tachycardia, rising temp, CO2...

670
00:35:25,993 --> 00:35:27,411
CO2...

671
00:35:27,561 --> 00:35:28,695
It's the anesthesia.

672
00:35:28,762 --> 00:35:30,697
Malignant hyperthermia. Get the MH cart.

673
00:35:30,764 --> 00:35:32,198
140 dantrolene, STAT.

674
00:35:32,266 --> 00:35:34,067
Kalu, Murphy, get as many
cooling blankets as you can.

675
00:35:34,134 --> 00:35:35,279
We need to get this temperature down.

676
00:35:35,326 --> 00:35:36,236
- Coming out.
- Now!

677
00:35:36,317 --> 00:35:39,600
Hyperventilate at 100% O2,
10 liters per minute.

678
00:35:39,662 --> 00:35:41,967
Flush out the old anesthetic,
lower the ETCO2.

679
00:35:42,006 --> 00:35:43,901
I want vecuronium on deck.
We got to keep him under.

680
00:35:43,978 --> 00:35:44,944
Let's move!

681
00:35:50,784 --> 00:35:52,151
And we're on.

682
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,788
- Uh, temp's not coming down.
- Wait.

683
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:04,162
CO2 is coming down.

684
00:36:04,246 --> 00:36:05,946
Heart rate is coming down, too.

685
00:36:06,014 --> 00:36:08,482
Temperature is 101.

686
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:10,584
Okay. Nice work, everyone.

687
00:36:10,652 --> 00:36:13,016
Thank you very much.

688
00:36:13,522 --> 00:36:15,125
Terry Fox.

689
00:36:15,449 --> 00:36:17,968
Or my personal favorite... Jim Abbott.

690
00:36:29,071 --> 00:36:30,671
Come in.

691
00:36:33,075 --> 00:36:34,839
Hi.

692
00:36:35,043 --> 00:36:39,012
I need to talk to you about Dr. Coyle.

693
00:36:42,243 --> 00:36:44,844
Dr. Browne.

694
00:36:44,967 --> 00:36:47,770
I wanted to talk to you
about the same thing.

695
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,614
Please.

696
00:36:59,901 --> 00:37:03,120
The surgery was a success.

697
00:37:03,438 --> 00:37:06,907
And the outcome
might be better than expected.

698
00:37:06,975 --> 00:37:09,076
There will still be significant
neurological dysfunction

699
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:12,513
on your left side, but not
as much as we'd anticipated.

700
00:37:12,581 --> 00:37:14,949
Sick!

701
00:37:16,284 --> 00:37:19,086
Thank you.

702
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:20,955
You did good, my friend.

703
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,930
You have to be patient.

704
00:37:34,805 --> 00:37:37,204
Nah.

705
00:37:38,243 --> 00:37:41,575
Is patience a bad thing?

706
00:37:42,627 --> 00:37:47,494
Acceptance is a bad thing.

707
00:37:51,479 --> 00:37:57,358
When I was a kid, I...
I wasn't good at jack.

708
00:37:58,135 --> 00:38:01,760
But I never quit.

709
00:38:03,183 --> 00:38:05,308
I...

710
00:38:06,652 --> 00:38:08,792
found my thing.

711
00:38:11,139 --> 00:38:15,378
Don't ever let anyone tell you

712
00:38:15,667 --> 00:38:20,331
what you can and can't...

713
00:38:21,643 --> 00:38:23,017
do.

714
00:38:49,578 --> 00:38:53,145
I'm sorry. For last night.

715
00:38:53,793 --> 00:38:56,084
It was a rough day. I was tired.

716
00:38:56,279 --> 00:38:58,763
Probably had a few too...

717
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:02,050
Your relationship with
your father is your business...

718
00:39:02,115 --> 00:39:03,824
Neil, you don't have to.

719
00:39:10,651 --> 00:39:12,518
I'll call your dad, and...

720
00:39:12,763 --> 00:39:14,974
I don't want to have kids.

721
00:39:31,086 --> 00:39:33,588
Shaun, I'm gonna drive you home.

722
00:39:34,318 --> 00:39:35,851
You're gonna see Melissa.

723
00:39:35,901 --> 00:39:37,558
If you don't like her, she'll leave.

724
00:39:37,626 --> 00:39:40,761
But there's no more running away.

725
00:39:41,558 --> 00:39:43,808
Why do you think I'm doing this?

726
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:46,559
Because you are stubborn.

727
00:39:46,611 --> 00:39:49,280
Ok-Okay, yeah, okay, sure. I'm stubborn.

728
00:39:49,347 --> 00:39:51,782
But I'm doing this for you, okay?

729
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:53,465
So that you can have a better life,

730
00:39:53,527 --> 00:39:56,220
so that you can have a happier life.

731
00:39:56,288 --> 00:39:59,082
What if it doesn't make me happy?

732
00:39:59,543 --> 00:40:01,559
What if it doesn't make me happy?

733
00:40:01,626 --> 00:40:04,737
What if it only makes <i>you</i> happy?

734
00:40:05,404 --> 00:40:08,276
You think... You think
I'm doing this to make me happy?

735
00:40:08,377 --> 00:40:10,229
I'm not happy, Shaun.

736
00:40:10,284 --> 00:40:13,118
I'm not close to being happy,
and you know what?

737
00:40:13,143 --> 00:40:14,690
I am done explaining,

738
00:40:14,753 --> 00:40:17,721
I am done bribing,
and I am done talking.

739
00:40:17,792 --> 00:40:18,892
- Now let's go.
- No. N-No.

740
00:40:18,956 --> 00:40:20,244
- No! Let's go!
- No!

741
00:40:20,312 --> 00:40:21,645
No.

742
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:25,256
No, I... I want to make
my own decisions.

743
00:40:25,308 --> 00:40:26,908
Shaun, can you keep your
voice down, please? Please?

744
00:40:26,985 --> 00:40:29,987
You... You cannot keep
ordering me around, okay?

745
00:40:30,055 --> 00:40:31,755
You're not my father!

746
00:40:33,491 --> 00:40:35,192
I know that.

747
00:40:35,414 --> 00:40:37,785
Shaun, I don't understand...

748
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:40,125
- Okay.
- why this is so...

749
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:42,256
- You don't let anyone...
- upsetting. I don't get it.

750
00:40:42,402 --> 00:40:46,744
- ever tell you what you can and can't do.
- Shaun, let's just calm down now, please.

751
00:40:46,802 --> 00:40:47,931
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Okay, don't...

752
00:40:47,956 --> 00:40:50,181
let anyone ever tell you
what you can and can't do!

753
00:40:50,259 --> 00:40:52,254
- Hey, just calm... Shaun. Hey, hey, Shaun.
- I want to make my own decisions.

754
00:40:52,339 --> 00:40:54,379
- Okay, okay, okay.
- I want to make my own decisions!

755
00:40:54,464 --> 00:40:56,504
- I'm just trying to help.
- I want make my own...

756
00:40:56,571 --> 00:40:57,638
- Shaun!
- I don't want help!

757
00:40:59,241 --> 00:41:01,041
I...

758
00:41:11,847 --> 00:41:13,581
What were you thinking?!

759
00:41:13,682 --> 00:41:15,956
I do not need you to fight my battles,

760
00:41:16,024 --> 00:41:18,315
and I certainly never asked you to.

761
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,350
And if you really respected me,

762
00:41:20,413 --> 00:41:22,347
you would not treat me like some damsel

763
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:23,515
who needed protection, okay?

764
00:41:23,583 --> 00:41:25,017
You would treat me with the respect

765
00:41:25,084 --> 00:41:27,419
that you would automatically
give to a man.

766
00:41:27,487 --> 00:41:28,620
You'd treat me like a person

767
00:41:28,688 --> 00:41:31,523
capable of handling her own life!

768
00:41:31,591 --> 00:41:34,426
And maybe... maybe it's too much
to ask of you.

769
00:41:34,879 --> 00:41:37,597
Apparently Andrews agrees with you.

770
00:41:38,331 --> 00:41:41,199
I've just been fired for
physically assaulting an employee.

771
00:41:47,349 --> 00:41:50,176
Shaun? Shaun!

772
00:41:50,676 --> 00:41:52,110
Where would he go?

773
00:41:52,178 --> 00:41:53,942
Is there a place he likes to hang out,

774
00:41:54,013 --> 00:41:56,648
- a place where he feels comfortable?
- No, I don't know.

775
00:41:56,716 --> 00:41:58,997
I mean, he's not at the hospital.

776
00:41:59,085 --> 00:42:03,745
And there used to be
a picture here of Shaun...

777
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:06,355
and his brother, Steve.

778
00:42:08,127 --> 00:42:09,694
What do you think that means?

779
00:42:15,808 --> 00:42:17,744
It means he's not coming back.
