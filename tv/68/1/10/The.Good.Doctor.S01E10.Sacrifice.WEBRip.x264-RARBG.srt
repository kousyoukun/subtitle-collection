00:42:02,688 --> 00:42:05,023
I mean, he's not
at the hospital.

878
00:42:05,056 --> 00:42:09,961
And there used to be
a picture here of Shaun...

879
00:42:09,995 --> 00:42:12,564
[sighs]
and his brother, Steve.

880
00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:15,801
What do you think
that means?

881
00:42:15,834 --> 00:42:21,907
**

882
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:24,142
It means
he's not coming back.

883
00:42:30,115 --> 00:42:38,156
**

884
00:42:38,189 --> 00:42:46,264
**

885
00:42:46,297 --> 00:42:54,339
**

886
00:42:54,372 --> 00:43:02,681
