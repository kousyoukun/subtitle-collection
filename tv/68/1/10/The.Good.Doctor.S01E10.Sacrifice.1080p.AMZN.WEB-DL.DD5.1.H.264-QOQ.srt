做多处韧带重建术
reconstruction on his elbow,

5
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:09,720
我这边有两个协助我和梅伦德斯医生的住院医名额
and I've got room for a couple residents to assist me and Dr. Melendez.

6
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,550
太棒了
Awesome.

7
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:13,340
我之前从没协助过这种手术
I've never assisted on one of those before.

8
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:14,460
安德鲁斯医生清楚
Dr. Andrews knows that.

9
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,000
所以他才用圣诞节清晨的语气宣布消息
That's why he's acting like it's Christmas morning.

10
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,830
我猜你也没给职业运动员做过手术
I'm guessing you've never operated on a pro athlete, either.

11
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,540
据我所知
Um, last time I checked,

12
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:23,000
你说的是两个名额  但我们有三人
a "Couple" means "Two," and there's three of us.

13
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,460
还有个好消息
More good news.

14
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:27,900
剩下那名住院医师将协助科利医生
Whoever isn't with us will be assisting Dr. Coyle

15
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,990
做双腿筋膜切开术

Bobby Ato? Don't think I've heard of him.

21
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:49,260
他是职业运动员吗
He's a pro athlete?

22
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,060
是职业的  但不知道算不算运动员
He's a pro. I don't know if I'd call him in athlete.

23
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,140
电子运动
E-sports.

24
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:54,210
电子游戏吗
Video games?

25
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,190
他是世上首屈一指的玩家
He's one of the best in the world.

26
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:56,430
去年他获得的奖金
Last year, he won enough prize money

27
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,500
都够给他妈妈在蒙特雷买幢沙滩别墅了
to buy his mom a beach house in Monterey.

28
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:00,000
还是现金支付
Paid cash.

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,770
他被列为贵宾病患
Is he considered a very important person

30
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:05,850
是因为他是运动员还是因为他很有钱
because he's an athlete or because he has a lot of money?

31
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:06,710
-都是  -都是
- Both. - Both.

32
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,840

I have to go.

00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:44,180
我们最好见一面
before our first in-home session.

41
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,950
好让你感到自在些
Just to make sure you're comfortable.

42
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,490
我不自在
I am not comfortable.

她很好  哥们儿
She's good, bro.

58
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,250
她说自从你给她做了乳房重建后
She said she gets checked out at the beach all the time

59
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,150
她在沙滩上总能收获很多目光
ever since you did her breast reconstruction.

60
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,660
所以谢谢你咯
So, uh, thanks. I guess.

61

我的情况是...

但你到底怎么了  哥们儿
But what is wrong with you, bro?

82
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:15,970
你该像个外科医生那样大显身手
You gotta be legit smart to land a gig as a surgeon

83
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:19,820
却被他像对待菜鸟医生一样否定了
and he just shut you down like a noob.

84
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:23,940
我会再次提出我的想法  我会的
I'll bring the idea up again. I do that.

85
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,230
他们不尊重你
They don't respect you.

86
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,930
他们一开始就该听你说完
And they should listen to you the first time.

87
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,760
-我没法控制他们的行为  -你当然能

这就是打游戏的关键
That's what playing the game is all about.

89
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,000
就在于控制敌方
It's about controlling your opponent.

90
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,720
你得找到合适的策略
You gotta find the right strategy.

91
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,000
这不是游戏
It is not a game.

92
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,680
一切都是游戏  兄弟  一切都是游戏
Everything's a game, man. Everything's a game.

93
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,370
只是有时赌注要大一些
Just sometimes the stakes are higher,

94
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:44,840
而这次的赌注是我的手臂
and this time it's my arm.

95
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:54,180
看来是你抽到了下下签
So, I'm guessing you drew the short straw.

96
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,410
-你说什么  -你在这
- I beg your pardon? - Well, you're here

97

and your co-residents are on the VIP case.

我很厉害  但我还是更想跟梅伦德斯和安德鲁斯
I'm awesome and I'd still rather be with Melendez and Andrews.

99
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,780
-不  没事  -别激动  没事的
- No, it's fine -- - Relax. It's cool.

100
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,280
跟我说说病患情况

在单车课上因用力过猛导致了骨筋膜室综合征
presenting with Compartment Syndrome caused by extreme overexertion at a spin class.

103

导致她的腿部肌肉...
The condition has caused the muscles in her legs to --

104

-很好  -我还没说完
- Okay. Great. - I wasn't finished.

105
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,580
足够体现你的聪明和仔细了
Finished enough to show me you're smart and thorough.

106
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:19,640
知道治疗方案了吗
You know the treatment plan?

107
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,390
-需要切口...  -很好
- We need to make incisions on -- - Good.

108
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,300
你带头
You take lead.

109
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,810
我们要在每条腿的两侧
We need to make a number of long incisions

110
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,930
切开几处切口以缓解压力
down both sides of each leg to relieve the tension

111
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,920
并恢复正常血液循环
and return healthy circulation.

112
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,130
重要的是得赶紧手术
It's important we act quickly.

113
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,150
如果没控制住肿胀
If we don't get the swelling under control,

114
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,040
损伤将无法挽回
the damage could be irreparable.

115
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,680
什么意思  我需要截肢吗
What does that mean? I could lose my legs?

116
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,730
就因为单车课上用力过猛了
From working out too hard in a spin class?

117
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:52,910
别担心  你姐姐不会有事的
No, don't worry. Your sister's gonna be just fine.

118
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:55,200
我很确信发现得很及时
Look, I'm very confident we caught this in time.

119
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,360
麻烦向前趴一下
If you could lean forward?

120
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,930
我得检查你的肾脏没受影响
I just need to check your kidneys haven't been affected.

121
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,200
如果有触痛请告诉我
Let me know if you have any tenderness.

122
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:12,490
现在取出掌肌
Extracting the palmaris now.

123
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,410
安德鲁斯医生  我看了你在《激流新闻》的评论
Dr. Andrews, I read your op-ed in Gen Surge News.

124
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:25,580
文章很出色
Brilliant piece.

125
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,500
从没想到持续护理不足
Never realized the lack of continuity of care

126
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,000
是如此严重的问题
was such a severe problem.

127
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:33,970
梅伦德斯医生
Dr. Melendez...

128

129
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,170
谢谢
Thank you.

130
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,490
鉴于病患的握力缺失情况
Given the patient's grip weakness,

131
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:43,670
我们可以做一个神经传导实验
we could do a nerve conduction test

132
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,860
以排除任何并发的神经损害
to rule out any concurrent nerve damage.

133
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:46,590
不行
No.

134
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,810
好了  似乎现在可以暂停一下
Okay, that looks like a good stopping point.

135
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:55,070
卡卢医生  你来
Dr. Kalu...step in.

136
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,020
-有什么问题吗  -没有  看起来很好
- Something wrong? -No, it looks good.

137
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,920
我只是想给卡卢医生一个机会
I just want to give Dr. Kalu an opportunity

138
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,400
让他展示一下他的能耐
to show us what he can do.

139
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:03,000
只要你没意见就行
As long as that's okay with you.

140
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,520
当然
Sure.

141
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:06,510
谢谢  安德鲁斯医生
Thank you, Dr. Andrews.

142
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,880
好了  看上去不错
All right, looking good.

143
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,630
开始做另一侧
Let's move to the lateral side.

144
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,600
姑娘们  今晚我们去哪儿玩
So, what are we doing tonight, ladies?

145
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,120
去非凡酒吧怎么样
How about we go to Viva's?

146
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,390
好主意
Sounds good.

147
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,660
电刀
Bovie.

148
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,630
你怎么这么安静  布朗医生
You're awfully quiet over there, Dr. Browne.

149
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:44,230
我只是在专注做事
I'm just focused.

150
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,990
我知道你平时都和梅伦德斯一起上手术
I know you're used to operating with Melendez,

151
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:48,220
但我们这比较有意思
but we have fun here.

152
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,930
我觉得当人们放松时
I feel like when it's less tense,

153
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:51,470
会更少犯错
people make fewer mistakes.

154
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:52,570
好的
Okay.

155
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,270
你想做另一条腿吗
You wanna take the other leg?

156
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:57,440
真的
Really?

157
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,470
当然  实践是最好的学习方式  不是吗
Yeah, best way to learn is by doing it, right?

158
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,330
当然
Definitely.

159
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:02,390
那就放手去做吧
So go for it.

160

肖恩  早上好
Shaun, good morning.

193
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,070
早上好  格拉斯曼医生
Good morning, Dr. Glassman.

194
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,050
和梅利莎聊得怎么样
How'd it go with Melissa?

195
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,660
她对我...
She was...

196
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:51,420
帮助很大
very helpful.

197
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,410
你穿的衣服和昨天一样  肖恩
You're wearing the same clothes as yesterday, Shaun.

198
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,170
你先请
After you.

199
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:08,380
很显然我们各执己见
Apparently we are at an impasse.

200
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:12,000
我真的认为梅利莎可以帮到你
I feel strongly that Melissa can be very helpful to you.

201
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,570
而你却完全不这么认为
You feel so strongly that she can't

202
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:18,150
甚至愿意为此牺牲良好的睡眠和个人卫生
that you're willing to sacrifice a good night's sleep and hygiene.

203
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:20,520
肖恩  你身上有味道了
Shaun, you smell.

204
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:27,000
我会在医生休息室冲个澡
I will shower in the doctor's lounge.

205
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,420
那真是太好了
Well, great.

206
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,480
至少一个问题解决了
That solves one problem.

207
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:33,630
你不惜待在这一整晚  就为了逃避面谈
You stayed here all night just to avoid a confrontation.

208
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,360
直接说「不去」就好  肖恩
Just say "No," Shaun.

209
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,570
直接说「不去」
You know? Just say "No."

210
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:37,410
不去
No!

211
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:40,260
不去
No.

212
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,220
很好  好极了
Great. That's just great.

213
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:44,280
我不用非得去见梅利莎
I don't have to see Melissa?

214
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,840
不用  你不用非得去见梅利莎
No, you don't have to see Melissa.

215
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,130
你是个成年人了  你可以自己拿主意
You're a grown man. You can make your own decisions.

216
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:52,680
我只是觉得她会对你有所帮助
I just happen to feel that she could be of great help to you.

217
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,560
这...
That...

218
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:56,410
这样吧
I'll tell you what.

219
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,090
如果你见三次梅利莎
You see Melissa three times

220
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:03,490
我就给你买你想要装在电视上的环绕声系统如何
and I will buy you the surround-sound system you want for your television.

221
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:04,920
你在收买我吗
Are you bribing me?

222
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:07,090
我想是的
I suppose I am.

223
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:10,210
如果你不喜欢她  她会离开
If you don't like her, she'll leave.

224
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,630
而且我保证我之后再也不会插手这件事
And I promise I will never say another word about it.

225
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:15,410
这是个很棒的交易
That's a pretty good deal.

226
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:22,380
好吧
Okay.

227
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:23,930
好
Okay.

228
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,810
我今晚会和她见面
I will meet with her tonight.

229
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,270
这就对了  肖恩
That's good, Shaun.

230
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:43,910
生理盐水吗  我之前从未见过这种方法
Saline? I've never seen it done quite like that.

231
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:47,140
我有个教授来自葡萄牙
Yeah, I had a professor from Portugal.

232
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:50,110
他们那里就是这么做的
Apparently it's how they do it over there.

233
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,310
这可以缓解疼痛
It's supposed to lessen the pain.

234
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,260
好消息是你的组织活性良好  呈粉红色
Well, the good news is your tissue is nice and pink,

235
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,560
这说明你的腿很健康
which means it's healthy.

236
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:58,710
不幸的是  水肿并没有如我们所愿的消下去
Unfortunately, the swelling is not coming down like we'd hoped.

237
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:01,040
这是不是意味着你们要给我截肢了
Does this mean you're going to have to amputate?

238
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,220
不  不  有时我们需要时间
No, no. Sometimes it just takes time.

239
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:04,660
我们会治好你的
We'll take care of you.

240
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,110
做得很好  布朗医生
Very nice work, Dr. Browne.

241
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,270
能帮我个忙  交换一下患者吗
Can you do me a solid and trade patients?

242
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:24,640
不  不可能  安德鲁斯让我主管患者
No, not a chance. Andrews let me take lead.

243
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,100
科利也让我主管
Coyle let me take lead, too.

244
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:28,670
那有什么问题
So what is the problem?

245
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,780
他有点太过友好了
He's a little too friendly.

246
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,060
他很奇怪地拍了我的背
He patted my back in a weird way.

247
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,770
我说不好  我觉得有些尴尬
I don't know. It was -- It was awkward.

248
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:38,790
我想他只是想和你融洽相处而已
I'm sure he's just trying to establish a rapport.

249
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:41,530
或许吧
Maybe?

250
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:42,780
我不知...
I don't...

251
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,900
肖恩  换吗
Shaun? Switch?

252
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,690
不换
No.

253
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:48,410
我喜欢博比
I like Bobby.

254
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,000
他可以给我很好的建议
He has very good advice.

255
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,020
所以  谁都做了什么
So, who did what?

256
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:00,120
大部分手术是由我和安德鲁斯医生完成的
Well, I did, uh, most of the surgery along with Dr. Andrews

257
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,060
卡卢医生负责更换你的一条撕裂韧带
and Dr. Kalu aided in replacing one of your torn ligaments.

258
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:05,400
几周之内你就能恢复到竞技状态
You should be back in competition shape in a few weeks time.

259
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,810
酷毙了
Word.

260
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,940
那你呢  你做了什么
What about you? What'd you do?

261
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:12,130
我帮忙清理植入的肌腱
I helped to clean the grafted tendons.

262
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:14,830
就这样
That's it.

263
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:16,650
是的
Yes.

264
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:18,290
拜托  你没有在这里面鼓捣鼓捣吗
Come on. You didn't get up in there?

265
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:26,020
你的肌无力症状
Y-Your muscle weakness

266
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:29,240
伴随体温升高
along with the high body temperature

267
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,930
很可能是多发性硬化的早期症状
could be an early indicator of multiple sclerosis.

268
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,780
我们应该预约磁共振检查
We should order an MRI.

269
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:40,090
我们已经讨论过无数次了
We have talked about this countless times.

270
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:43,130
是的  我们应该预约磁共振检查
Yes. We should order an MRI.

271
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,520
我们不会预约磁共振检查的
We are not ordering an MRI.

272
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,860
你不尊重我
You don't respect me.

273
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,340
现在确实不怎么尊重
Not right now, I don't.

274
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,170
安德鲁斯医生  梅伦德斯医生
Dr. Andrews, Dr. Melendez.

275
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:50,900
我们现在正和职业运动员打交道
Given the fact we're dealing with a pro athlete,

276
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,000
就算是打个小嗝都应该慎重对待
even the slightest hiccup could be problematic.

277
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:56,810
我想博比会欣赏我们的用心
I think Bobby would be impressed by our being extra attentive.

278
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:58,710
卡卢说得对
Kalu is right.

279
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,450
现在正是他作为专业运动员的鼎盛时期
he is a pro athlete in his prime earning years.

280
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:03,730
我们应该百分之百确保他没事
We should make sure we leave him 100%.

281
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,290
去做磁共振
Do the MRI.

282
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:16,560
干得漂亮  你说服他们了
Nice score. You got 'em to listen.

283
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,980
去做磁共振
Do the MRI.

284
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,370
不是我  是杰瑞德说服他们了
No, Jared did.

285
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,710
为什么他能做到  而你不行
How did he get there when you couldn't?

286
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,290
他说得很友好
He asked nicely.

287
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:27,270
你说得也很友好
Okay, you asked nicely.

288
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:30,570
是的  没错
Yes. Yes, I did.

289
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:33,080
你要是想要荣耀  就得激烈些  哥们
You gotta be fierce if you want the glory, bro.

290
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,410
不
Oh, no.

291
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,920
我不想要荣耀  哥们
I do not want the glory, bro.

292
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,830
我只想成为一个好的外科医生
I just want to be a good surgeon.

293
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:41,060
谁都想要荣耀
Everyone wants glory.

294
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,810
人们因此而实现欲望
It -- It's how you get what you want.

295
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:44,390
每个人都有欲望
And everybody's got wants.

296
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,580
我想要环绕声扬声器系统
I want a surround-sound speaker system.

297
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:54,000
我需要去见治疗师才能得到它
To get it, I have to see a therapist.

298
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,110
我不想要去见治疗师
I don't want to have to see a therapist.

299
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:59,900
好吧  我就是那么得到第一台PS2游戏机的
Okay, yeah, that's -- that's how I got my first PS2.

300
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:03,670
我父母分开之后  收买我去见的治疗师
Yeah, my parents bribed me to go to therapy after they split up.

301
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,620
治疗师什么样
What was therapy like?

302
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:06,500
挺简单的  哥们
Pretty basic, bro.

303
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,580
她告诉我该做什么
She'd tell me what to do,

304
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,810
如何与我父母相处
how to deal with my parents.

305
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:09,850
有帮助吗
Was it helpful?

306
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:11,030
我说不好
I don't know.

307
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,430
我从没做过任何她让我做的事
I never did anything she told me to do.

308
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,590
可以这样吗
Is that an option?

309
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:20,640
跟从自己的心  永远没问题
Doing whatever the hell you feel like doing is always an option.

310
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,830
我就提醒一下
Just a gentle reminder --

311
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:31,350
今晚八点和我爸吃饭
dinner with my dad tonight at 8:00.

312
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:32,730
我记在日程表中了
It is on my calendar.

313
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:34,190
吉普赛国王演唱会也记在日程表中了
So was the Gypsy Kings concert,

314
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:36,150
但我记得...
and I -- I seem to remember...

315
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,370
有道理
Fair enough.

316
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,770
贵宾病例如何了
How is the VIP case?

317
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:43,330
肖恩似乎有些不对劲
Shaun seems off about something.

318
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:44,130
你和他谈过了吗
Did you talk to him?

319
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:46,580
是啊  和肖恩谈话就能解决问题
Yes. Because talking to Shaun solves problems.

320
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,030
而安德鲁斯...
And Andrews is...

321
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,700
他是你的眼中钉
He's a pain in your ass.

322
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,190
不  实际上他太过友好了
No. He's actually too friendly.

323
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:54,710
杰瑞德拍了他的马屁  他就突然不再刻薄了
Jared kisses his ass and suddenly he's cutting.

324
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:58,050
拍马屁是外科医生的实用技能
Well, ass kissing is a useful skill for a surgeon.

325
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,970
你的衬衫真好看
That's a very beautiful blouse.

326
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:01,180
我还得去吃晚餐吗
Do I still have to go to dinner?

327
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,560
是的  会很好的
Yes. It'll be nice.

328
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,110
你会喝点好红酒  我爸会付账
You'll have some nice wine and my dad will pay.

329
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,870
他会逼我们定下婚礼日期的
He'll push us to set a wedding date.

330
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,060
4月25号
April 25th.

331
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,170
你预定什么了吗
Did you book something?

332
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:09,980
没有
No.

333
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,340
但我爸不需要知道这些
But my dad doesn't need to know that.

334
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:17,780
有什么消息
What do you got?

335
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:20,460
手术修复手肘看起来没问题
Looks like the surgically repaired elbow is fine.

336
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:22,190
如我所料
As I suspected.

337
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,330
但莫菲注意到了周边的问题
But Murphy noticed something in the periphery,

338
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:26,080
高一点的地方  就在二头肌上方
a little higher up, just above the bicep.

339
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,090
是我的主意
It was my idea.

340
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:29,840
是的  我刚刚说了
Yes, I just said that.

341
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:33,520
所以我们拍了高些地方的片  并注意到了这个
So, we took an image from higher up and noticed this.

342
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:39,700
完全包括住了他的臂丛神经
It's encasing the entirety of his brachial plexus.

343
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,540
这太大了
This thing is massive.

344
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:48,200
活检明确显示这是神经鞘瘤
Biopsy indicated it's definitely a schwannoma.

345
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,330
并且明显是恶性的
And it's definitely malignant.

346
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:53,730
这地方很棘手  但也许你能移除
It's in a tricky spot, but you might be able to remove it.

347
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:57,770
根据放疗化疗结合的手法...
Follow it up with a combo of radiotherapy and chemo to finish it o...

348
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:01,820
怎么了  有什么问题
What? What's the problem?

349
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:05,200
博比·奥托  博比·奥托  职业玩家博比·奥托
Robert Ato. Bobby Ato. Pro-gamer Bobby Ato?

350
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:06,070
你是他的粉丝吗
You a fan?

351
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:07,430
我三年前遇到过他
I met him three years ago.

352
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:09,920
我在旧金山市立医院当肿瘤学顾问
Oncology consult for SF Muni.

353
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:14,770
他三年前得过癌症
He had cancer three years ago?

354
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,900
你为什么没告诉我们你得过癌症
Why the hell wouldn't you tell us that you had already had cancer?

355
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,770
那是三年前  在我的小腿部位
It was in my lower leg three years ago.

356
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:28,560
那和你如何治疗我的手肘有什么关系
How's that gonna change how you fix my elbow?

357
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:32,100
这对我如何看待莫菲医生提到的症状影响巨大
It would have a huge effect on how I viewed the symptoms that Dr. Murphy noticed.

358
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,890
你没听莫菲医生的话
You didn't listen to Dr. Murphy

359
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:35,400
因为你不尊重他
because you don't respect him.

360
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,770
因为莫菲医生和常人不同
'Cause Dr. Murphy is different.

361
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:37,900
我尊重他
I respect him.

362
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,840
他有好想法  也有坏想法
He has good ideas, and he has bad ideas.

363
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,880
看来你否定的这个是个好想法
Turns out this was a good one. That you shot down.

364
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,720
你为什么隐瞒真相
Why did you hide the truth?

365
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:48,760
之前的肿瘤诊断并不丢人
A previous cancer diagnosis isn't shameful.

366
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:59,940
首诊之后  我脑袋里全部都是
After the first diagnosis, all I was thinking was,

367
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:04,130
「还会回来吗  有多糟糕呢」
"Will it come back? How bad will it be?"

368
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,490
我心烦意乱  哥们
I was distracted, man.

369
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,950
我没法专心  我接连失败
I couldn't focus, and I hit a slump --

370
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:10,240
你担心癌症扰乱了你的比赛
Wait, you were worried that cancer was messing with your gaming?

371
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,410
没错  哥们
Yeah, man!

372
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:14,170
癌症让我与冠军失之交臂
It cost me a championship.

373
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,770
我决定将之与所有负面情绪和身体的虚弱
I decided to block it out along with all the thoughts

374
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:18,650
一起拒之门外
of negativity and physical weakness,

375
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:22,660
并由此成为了世界第一
and like that, I became the best in the world.

376
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:29,270
我们需要做全身扫描
We need to do a full-body scan

377
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:32,490
确保癌症没有转移
to make sure the cancer has not already metastasized.

378
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:34,180
他说了
What he said.

379
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,780
我说的
What I said.

380
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,340
看起来不错
This looks great.

381
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:44,930
肿胀开始消退了
The swelling is starting to reduce.

382
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:46,890
我们可以开始缩紧缝合了
We can start tightening the sutures.

383
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,850
终于有好消息了
Finally some good news.

384
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,870
你看起来也好多了
You look like you're doing better, too...

385
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,400
你上司不在之后
now your boss is gone.

386
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,150
科利医生吗  他挺好的
Dr. Coyle? He's fine.

387
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,490
和我你不用「紧跟党的路线」
You don't have to toe the party line with me.

388
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:01,510
相信我  我明白
Trust me. I get it.

389
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:04,870
我差点在单车课上骑车而死
I almost rode myself to death in a spin class

390
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:06,660
就因为我听见几个投资者说
because I overheard a couple of investors say

391
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,420
他们「觉得我的观念还行」
that they "liked the concept just fine,"

392
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,280
但我的脚踝「太让人分心」了
but that my cankles were "too distracting."

393
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,240
什么  你的想法非常棒
What? Your idea is brilliant.

394
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,110
而且你很美  去他们的
And you're beautiful. Screw those jackasses.

395
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,740
格蕾丝  你不明白
Grace, you don't get it.

396
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:22,790
你的脸很美  腰臀比正好
You got the face, perfect little hip-to-waist ratio,

397
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:25,400
大部分投资公司都是一群男人经营的
and most VC firms are run by a bunch of bros,

398
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:28,540
所以我臀部的大小和我能筹集到的钱财之间
so there is an inverse relationship between the size of my ass

399
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,150
有着反比关系
and how much money I can raise.

400
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:31,390
那你应该做些别的
Then you should do something else

401
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:33,370
避免和这群男人打交道
where you don't have to deal with bros.

402
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:34,950
做什么  修女吗
Like what, become a nun?

403
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:38,190
-抱歉  -你同意她的话
- Sorry. - You agree with her?

404
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,170
她差点害死自己
She nearly worked herself to death

405
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:42,300
就为了取悦几头有钱的猪猡
trying to please some pigs with money?

406
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,440
她不该如此
She shouldn't have to.

407
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,390
好极了  你要是找到了乌托邦  一定要告诉我
Great. Let me know when you find utopia.

408
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:47,840
但在那之前  我热爱我的工作
But until then, I love what I do.

409
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,060
所以我得遵守游戏规则  因为我要是让他们滚
So I got to play the game 'cause if I call them out,

410
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:54,360
我只会被贴上「婊子」的标签  甚至更糟
I just get labeled a "Bitch," or even worse.

411
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:56,690
你的心率升高了
Your heart rate's going up.

412
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,340
黑兹尔
Hazel?

413
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:01,000
黑兹尔
Hazel?

414
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,890
她快无法呼吸了
She's barely moving any air.

415
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,510
黑兹尔  能听到我说话吗
Hazel, can you hear me?

416
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:07,120
紧急呼叫  我得给她插管
Code blue! I need to intubate her.

417
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,850
给我一个咽喉镜和气管内管
Give me a laryngoscope and an ET tube.

418
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:10,130
给她吸纯氧
Let's get her on 100% oxygen.

419
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:14,180
紧急呼叫  四楼北面  407房间
Code blue. 4 North, room 407.

420
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,140
说说情况
Talk to me.

421
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,150
她的肺
Her lungs --

422
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,290
我认为再灌注损伤了
I think it's a reperfusion injury.

423
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,670
里面没有空间了
There's no room in here.

424
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:26,370
气道情况三级  甚至四级  你应该接手
Mallampati 3, maybe 4. You should take over.

425
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:28,760
你做得很好  给  用探条
You're doing fine. Here, use the bougie.

426
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,640
-感觉到会厌软骨了吗  -好像有
- You feel the epiglottis? - I think so.

427
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:37,510
好  再进去一点  你应该感觉进不去了
Okay, go a bit further, you should feel it stop.

428
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,310
如果能继续进去  那你就到了食道
If it keeps going, you're in the esophagus.

429
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:41,280
进不去了  好了  气管内管
It stopped, got it. ET tube?

430
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:47,540
会没事的
It's gonna be okay.

431
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:53,500
干得漂亮  医生
Strong work, Doctor.

432
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,960
不管是不是世界第一  这家伙疯了
Best in the world or not, this guy's insane.

433
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,780
竟然想躲过诊断
Hiding from a diagnosis?

434
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:05,310
没用的  它会找上你
Doesn't work -- it'll find you.

435
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:10,740
博比想成为最棒的  他是最棒的
Bobby wanted to be the best. He is the best.

436
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:12,130
我觉得他不是想成为最棒的
I don't think he was trying to be the best.

437
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:13,230
他应该只是害怕了
I think he was just scared.

438
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:16,240
那是什么  脑干旁边的
What's that? Next to the brain stem.

439
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:23,300
另一个神经鞘瘤
Another schwannoma.

440
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,580
正面情绪的力量到此为止
So much for the power of positive thinking.

441
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:38,140
这孩子真奇怪  他得过癌症
He's a strange kid. He had cancer.

442
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,840
就因为有所失去而停止跟进疾病
Stopped going to follow-ups because he started losing.

443
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:41,830
哪里奇怪了
What's so strange?

444
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,780
听着就是典型的否认情绪
Sounds like a classic case of denial.

445
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:46,570
我在想我们是否可以尝试新方法
I was thinking we could try something new.

446
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:47,640
或许用伽马刀
Maybe gamma knife?

447
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,550
我觉得不行  不适用于这种肿瘤
I don't think so. Wrong type of tumor for that.

448
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,540
如果我每过几个月就告诉你
What if I told you every few months

449
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:56,900
你很有可能要死  你会怎么样
that you had a real possibility you were gonna die?

450
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:00,540
我会很害怕  而且会听医生的话
I'd be scared. And I'd listen.

451
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:02,570
你可能会  也可能不会
Maybe you would, maybe you wouldn't.

452
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,570
就我个人而言  我觉得他没错
Personally, I think he's right --

453
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:06,040
拒绝这些世界末日的声音
shut down those voices of doom,

454
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,110
把时间用来去生活而不是等待死亡
spend your days living instead of dying.

455
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:10,270
但他也可能疯了
But he may also be crazy.

456
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,030
除了把他变成植物人
Short of making him a vegetable,

457
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,010
我不知道我们还能做什么
I don't know if there's anything we can do.

458
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,510
肖恩还好吗
Is -- Is Shaun okay?

459
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:25,920
他的工作还好吗
Is his work okay?

460
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:27,080
都好  只是
Yes, I just, um --

461
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,220
那他就没事
Then he's fine.

462
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:49,940
该死
Damn.

463
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:51,380
马进到酒吧来了
Horse walks into a bar.

464
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,870
酒保说...
Bartender says...

465
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,490
我们发现了另一处肿瘤
We found another mass.

466
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,150
虽然事与愿违  但没事
That's not how it goes, but cool.

467
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:01,190
我们也把它取出来
Let's knock it out, too.

468
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,520
肿瘤长在你的脑干上
The mass is located on your brain stem.

469
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,310
脑干是控制你的自主神经系统
Which controls your autonomic nervous system --

470
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,940
你的心脏和呼吸的
your heart, respiration.

471
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:11,440
其所在的位置让我们无法进行手术
Its positioning makes it inoperable.

472
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:24,920
我有过好成绩
I...had a good run.

473
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:30,510
我希望能持续更久  但...
Wish it was longer, but...

474
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,090
我在巅峰时刻结束
I'm gonna go out on top.

475
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:38,850
如果你们今天离开这个世界
If you went out today,

476
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,330
你们能说一样的话吗
could you say the same thing?

477
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:55,280
你当时在场是她的福气
She's lucky you were there.

478
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:58,810
我  你才是那个救了她的人
Me? You're the one who saved her.

479
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:00,830
在你的帮助下  很大的帮助
With your help. A lot of it.

480
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,070
所以  谢谢你
So, thank you.

481
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:08,010
你想喝一杯吗
Hey, look, you wanna -- you wanna get a drink?

482
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,220
也许缓一缓
Maybe take the edge off?

483
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:12,130
不用了  但还是谢谢你
No. But thank you, though.

484
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:15,560
你确定吗  我保证你会很开心
Are you sure? I promise you'll have fun.

485
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,410
我按摩手法很棒
I give great massages.

486
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,900
早上我会给你做一个好吃到死的煎蛋卷
And I'll make a killer omelet in the morning.

487
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:23,690
这真是太不合适了
That's really inappropriate.

488
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:25,100
我说了不
I said no.

489
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:28,600
抱歉  这又是哪一出
I'm sorry. W-W-- Where's this coming from?

490
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,530
你给了我很明确的暗示
You were -- You were clearly giving me signals.

491
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:31,640
不  我给你唯一的「暗示」
No, the only "Signal" I gave you

492
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:34,130
就是我对你完全不感兴趣
was that I wasn't interested in the slightest.

493
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,760
我只是听到你和卡卢
Okay, see, I just -- I heard about you and Kalu

494
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,250
在检录处约炮  所以我以为...
banging in the call room, so I figured --

495
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:41,070
谈话到此结束  你这个混蛋
This conversation is over. You're an ass.

496
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:42,440
我是个很随和的人
I'm pretty easygoing,

497
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:44,290
但你在违抗命令
but you're approaching insubordination.

498
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:47,630
你要举报我吗
You're gonna report me?

499
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:49,220
我不会举报任何人
I'm not gonna report anybody.

500
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,680
但也许下一次
But maybe next time,

501
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,810
当有人约你的时候  别这么死板
try not to have such a stick up your ass about being asked out.

502
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,040
拜托
Come on.

503
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,080
我一直以为小兔是最可爱的昵称
I always thought Bunny was the cutest nickname.

504
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,660
你当然这样认为  但当我12岁或20岁时
Of course you did, but you could've stopped calling me that

505
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:08,810
你可以不要那样叫我了
when I was 12 or -- or 20.

506
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,140
今天过得不顺吗
Rough day?

507
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,290
是的  发生了一些事
Yeah. Yeah, it was something.

508
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:20,240
这应该能让你开心点
Well, this should make you a little happier.

509
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:24,360
我决定承包你们整个婚礼
I have decided to take care of your entire wedding.

510
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:25,870
我们不需要
We don't need it.

511
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:28,300
不用谢
You're welcome.

512
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:29,500
我们又不是21岁的小孩
We're not 21.

513
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,490
我们能够轻松负担自己的婚礼
We're more than capable of paying for our own wedding.

514
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:33,780
我们赚的钱够多
We make good money.

515
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:37,040
但一旦你们有了孩子就不够了  小兔
But you won't once you start having kids, Bunny.

516
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:53,790
你在这里干什么
What are you doing in here?

517
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:57,940
我在躲避我的治疗师
I'm hiding from my therapist.

518
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:02,920
我得不到立体音响系统
I am not going to get a surround-sound speaker system.

519
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:06,040
但我会做任何我想做的事情
But I am doing whatever the hell I feel like doing.

520
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:08,770
可以把拖把递给我吗
Can you hand me that mop?

521
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:09,790
好的
Okay.

522
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:20,500
你对你的一生所做之事满意吗
Are you satisfied with what you've done with your life?

523
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:24,620
如果你明天就死了  你会开心吗
Would you be happy if you died tomorrow?

524
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:28,040
满意
Satisfied?

525
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:29,430
开心
Happy?

526
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:33,940
我在楼里做保洁...
I mean, I clean up a building, uh...

527
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,820
但我娶了此生挚爱
But I -- I married the love of my life.

528
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:41,080
我们养育了三个漂亮的孩子
Uh, we raised three beautiful kids.

529
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:44,930
其中一个有点淘气  但她现在乖多了
One of them had some troubles, but she's doing great now.

530
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:48,930
另外两个都做得很好
The other two are doing all right for themselves.

531
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,680
我对人也很友善
And I was good to people.

532
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,680
至少我这样认为
At least I think I was.

533
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:58,110
这个答案很棒
That's a very good answer.

534
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:04,380
如果你想看  我有女儿们的照片
I got pictures of the girls if you want see --

535
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,220
不用了
No.

536
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,980
你为什么要我辞职去组建家庭
So, why do I need to quit my job to have a family?

537
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,250
同意
Agreed.

538
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,560
她可以既是优秀的律师又是优秀的母亲
She can be a great lawyer and a great mom.

539
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:16,160
是的  她可以  但是为什么呢
Yes, she can, but why?

540
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,970
为什么要把时间浪费在工作上
W-Why waste your time working?

541
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:22,210
你应该像我一样  享受生活
You should be enjoying life, like me.

542
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:23,770
家庭信托里有很多钱
There's plenty in the family trust.

543
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:26,330
爸爸  我的工作很重要  我帮助人们
Dad, my work is important. I'm helping people --

544
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:28,850
小兔  你坐办公室
Bunny... you're pushing papers.

545
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:31,310
怎么能真的帮到人
How -- How is that really helping anyone?

546
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:33,120
也许我守旧  但我不明白
And maybe I'm old-fashioned, but I don't get it.

547
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,000
我以为你会更聪明
I-I thought you were smarter than that.

548
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,100
你宁愿她做懒惰的寄生虫
You'd prefer her to be a lazy parasite

549
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,140
靠信托基金过日子
living off a trust fund

550
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:40,540
而不是真的去为社会做贡献
as opposed to actually contributing to society?

551
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:41,990
寄生虫
Parasite?

552
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,740
我父亲赚了很多钱
My father made a lot of money.

553
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:48,300
我不会为此道歉
I'm not going to apologize for that.

554
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:52,350
他确保他的儿女和孙辈可以享受生活
He made sure his children and his grandchildren could enjoy their lives.

555
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:54,470
我没有伤害任何人
I'm not hurting anyone.

556
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:57,560
事实上  我用自己的方式帮助他人
In fact, I go out of my way to help people.

557
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:03,200
所以如果你认为我不值得尊敬  那么抱歉
So I'm sorry if that doesn't qualify me as a worthwhile person in your book.

558
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,990
我出去时会结账
I'll get the check on my way out.

559
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:09,950
爸爸  你不必...
Dad, you don't have to...

560
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,920
我做错了什么  肖恩
What am I doing wrong, Shaun?

561
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,720
我不知道
I don't know.

562
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:47,400
我试着...
I tried...

563
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:51,770
鼓励你  我试着支持你
encouraging, I've tried being supportive,

564
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:53,010
我试着讨好你
I've tried bribing you.

565
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:57,020
我不需要治疗师  不
I don't need a therapist. No.

566
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:59,140
看看四周  你看你睡在...
Look around you. What -- You're sleeping --

567
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:01,060
这个杂物室里
What is this, a broom closet?

568
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:04,810
看看你愿意做出的牺牲
Look at the sacrifices you're willing to make

569
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:06,320
只为了避开...
just to avoid...

570
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,410
我们稍后再聊
We're gonna pick this up later.

571
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,240
你得跟人事部提出投诉
You have to file a complaint with HR.

572
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:24,640
我那么做会得到「怀敌意」和「难相处」的标签
I do that and I get labeled "Hostile" and "Difficult,"

573
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,070
都对我的肤色和性别没帮助
neither of which work with my complexion or gender.

574
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:28,470
正因此才更应该表态
All the more reason to take a stand.

575
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:31,030
克莱尔  这种情况就该找人事部
Claire, this situation is exactly what HR is for.

576
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:32,580
我没说这很容易
I didn't say it was easy.

577
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,850
是  你说了
Yeah, you did.

578
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:35,730
这挺可怕而且需要勇气
Look, it's scary and it takes courage,

579
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:36,850
但这是对的事
but it's the right thing to do.

580
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:38,230
这是无意义的事
It's a pointless thing to do.

581
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:40,860
-他们会听你说  -他们会把错怪在我身上
- They'll listen to you. - They will shift the blame onto me.

582
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:41,940
就像你一样
Like you did.

583
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:43,850
什么  我怎么...
Whoa, what? How did I --

584
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:44,850
我找你说
I came to you,

585
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:46,660
你指责我把情况夸大
you accused me of exaggerating to get back onto the case.

586
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:48,600
不不不  我不是那个意思  我不知道...
No, no, no, that's not what I meant. I had no idea --

587
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,180
我说他太友好亲切了
I said he was too friendly.

588
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:52,860
你说他只是「试着建立密切关系」
You said he was "Trying to establish a rapport."

589
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:56,500
我是你的枕边人  杰瑞德
I'm sleeping with you, Jared,

590
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,230
而你都认为我反应过度了
and you thought I was overreacting.

591
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:00,850
你觉得三个陌生人会怎么看呢
How do you think three strangers will see things?

592
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,010
克莱尔  我很抱歉  非常抱歉
Claire, I'm sorry. I am so sorry.

593
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:10,060
别担心  那很正常
Don't worry about it. It's just the way it is.

594
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,590
我还有患者要去巡视
I've got a patient to round on.

595
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:16,380
我和梅伦德斯医生谈过了
Dr. Melendez and I had a talk

596
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,280
我们相信我们能切除肿瘤
and we believe we can excise the tumor

597
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,870
只要你愿意做出牺牲
if you're willing to make a sacrifice.

598
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:22,900
牺牲
Sacrifice?

599
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,020
听起来比死亡好
That sounds better than death.

600
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:27,440
我也是那么想
My thinking as well.

601
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,660
我们相信我们可以移除肿块
We believe we can remove the mass,

602
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:33,970
但我们也要从你的脑干取出一块东西
but we'll also have to take a piece out of your brain stem.

603
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:35,470
一块红核
A chunk of the red nucleus,

604
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:37,890
它的功能是控制你的左侧身体
which helps control the left side of your body.

605
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:40,440
你的那一侧会瘫痪
You'll be paralyzed on that side.

606
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:45,610
也可能造成进食和吞咽困难
It could also result in difficulty eating and swallowing.

607
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:47,290
说话困难
Speech difficulties.

608
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:52,930
我们做吧
Let's do it.

609
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:54,250
好样的
Good for you.

610
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,330
慢着  慢着
Hold on. Hold on.

611
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,380
博比  这手术风险很高
Bobby, this is very risky surgery.

612
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:04,020
你可能会死在手术台  就算一切顺利
You could die on the table, and even if all goes well,

613
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:06,050
你也会严重残疾
you will be severely disabled.

614
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:09,310
是的  我听到了  我接受
Yeah, I -- I was listening, and I'm in.

615
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:21,810
各位  我明白
Guys, hey, I get it.

616
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:25,810
如果我死了  我就死了
If I'm dead, I'm -- I'm dead.

617
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:31,050
如果没有  体育锻炼  再学习等等
But if not -- PT, relearning stuff, whatever.

618
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,560
都不会阻止我继续比赛
It's not gonna stop me from competing.

619
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:35,530
永远不会
Not ever.

620
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:40,550
博比  你的事业结束了
Bobby, your career is over.

621
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,120
你得明白这点
We need you to understand that.

622
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:50,860
是吗
Yeah?

623
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,980
一朝玩家  永世玩家
Once a gamer, always a gamer, huh?

624
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,080
我很钦佩你
You got my respect.

625
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:23,910
你发什么疯
What the hell is your problem?

626
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:25,830
如果你敢威胁克莱尔
If you ever threaten Claire,

627
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:26,970
跟她说话轻佻
take a disrespectful tone,

628
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:29,010
或是再敢斜视她
or so much as look at her cross-eyed again,

629
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:32,080
我会做出比把你推到墙上更可怕的事
I'm gonna do a hell of a lot more than put you up against a wall.

630
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:33,560
明白吗
We clear?

631
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:49,100
你的肺部情况好多了
Your lungs are looking a lot better.

632
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:53,480
总得来说你的情况不错
Overall, you're in pretty good shape.

633
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,170
谢谢你
Thank you.

634
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:02,770
不客气
You're welcome.

635
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:05,150
都是医生该做的
All part of the service.

636
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:08,290
你干得很好
And good for you.

637
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,370
我没睡着
I wasn't sleeping.

638
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:15,130
我听到你是怎么对付另一位医生的
I heard the way you handled that other doctor.

639
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:19,730
你全都听到了
You heard that? All of it?

640
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:23,070
但愿我也做得出来
I wish I had done that.

641
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,550
你很勇敢
You were brave.

642
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:27,360
不不
No, no.

643
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,870
我要是勇敢
If I was brave, I --

644
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,200
里克·艾伦
Rick Allen.

645
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:44,580
-谁  -<u>威豹乐队</u>的独臂鼓手
- Who? - One-armed drummer for Def Leppard.
<b>英国重金属新浪潮的代表性乐队之一</b>

646
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:45,590
拜托
Come on, man.

647
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:49,560
而这是肿瘤囊膜
And there is the tumor capsule.

648
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:52,110
里奇·帕克  有人知道吗
Richie Parker. Anyone?

649
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,520
那个赛车协会的吗  工程师  对吧
Isn't he a NASCAR guy? An engineer, right?

650
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,600
天生缺个胳膊
Born without arms?

651
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,640
奥坎波护士获得开门奖
And Nurse Ocampo gets the door prize.

652
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,280
现在我们从这个东西上面
And now we will take just a little piece

653
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:06,790
取一小块样品去做检查
of our friend here -- a nice sample to test.

654
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,100
谢谢  医生
Thank you, Doctor.

655
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:09,300
现在剩下的
And now the rest.

656
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,090
他或许没法自己系鞋带
He may not be able to tie his own shoes,

657
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:13,890
但我不会打赌他不能再比赛了
but I wouldn't bet against him ever competing again.

658
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:17,580
「不自由  毋宁死」
Aut libertatem aut mortem mihi da.

659
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,240
肖恩  你知道这是什么意思吗
Shaun, do you know that means?

660
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:22,700
不知道  跟手术无关
No. It's not relevant to this surgery.

661
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:25,050
有关系  查查看
Oh, it's relevant. Look it up.

662
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:26,300
无关
No, it's not.

663
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:31,060
心率和末二氧化碳浓度在上升
Heart rate and ETCO2 are rising.

664
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,800
体温稍有变化
Slight change in body temperature.

665
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,010
他的心率108了
His heart rate's 108.

666
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:35,880
检查插管  给他抽吸
Check tube placement and suction him.

667
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,050
他要是情况恶化  我们或许得放弃手术
If he takes a turn, we might have to abort.

668
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:40,040
我不觉得  都到这个地步了
I don't think so. I'm too far in.

669
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:41,110
稳住他
Keep him stable.

670
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:42,520
心动过速  心率攀升
He's tachy. Heart rate's climbing.

671
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:46,150
115 117 120  还在升
115, 117, 120, and rising.

672
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:48,480
他要室性心动过速了
He is going into v-tach.

673
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,680
罗伯特·奥托要死了
Robert Ato is dying.

674
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,230
我要慢慢把脑桥拿出来
I'm gonna pull out of the pons slowly.

675
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,210
等一下  你现在拿出来
Well, hold on. You pull out now,

676
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:00,770
可能会损坏到小脑脚
you might damage the cerebellar peduncle.

677
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:03,670
如果我现在不拿出来  他一旦开始抽搐就会死
If I don't get out now, I'll kill him if he starts seizing.

678
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:05,950
有点不对劲  心搏过速
Something's not right. Tachycardia?

679
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:07,660
心搏缓慢更说得通
Bradycardia would make more sense.

680
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:11,770
-有什么想法吗  -谁有想法
- Ideas. - Anyone?

681
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:15,030
告诉我你看到的
Tell me what you see.

682
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:18,190
心搏过速  体温再次升高
Tachycardia, rising body temperature again,

683
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:20,960
肌肉僵硬  二氧化碳在升高
muscle rigidity, CO2 is rising.

684
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,420
肌肉僵硬  哪一边
Muscle rigidity? Which side?

685
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,760
所有的肌肉
It's all over.

686
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,900
那就不是脑干的问题
Then it's not the brain stem.

687
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,890
否则只会有一边肌肉僵硬
We'd only have muscle rigidity on one side.

688
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:30,830
快想  心搏过速  体温升高  二氧化碳...
Think. Tachycardia, rising temp, CO2...

689
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:32,970
二氧化碳...
CO2...

690
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,600
是麻药
It's the anesthesia.

691
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,790
恶性高热  把MH车推过来
Malignant hyperthermia. Get the MH cart.

692
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:38,410
140硝苯呋海因  快
140 dantrolene, STAT.

693
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,130
卡卢  莫菲  多拿些降温毯过来
Kalu, Murphy, get as many cooling blankets as you can.

694
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:41,300
我们得把温降下来
We need to get this temperature down.

695
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,170
-好了  -现在就去
- Coming out. - Now!

696
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:44,450
纯氧正压通气
Hyperventilate at 100% O2,

697
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:45,590
每分钟十升
10 liters per minute.

698
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:47,870
把麻醉剂都冲出来  降低末二氧化碳浓度
Flush out the old anesthetic, lower the ETCO2.

699
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:50,020
准备好万可松  注意他的情况
I want vecuronium on deck. We got to keep him under.

700
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,090
动起来
Let's move!

701
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,690
好了
And we're on.

702
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,490
体温降下来了
Uh, temp's not coming down.

703
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:01,420
等等
Wait.

704
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:10,160
二氧化碳降下来了
CO2 is coming down.

705
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,590
心率也降下来了
Heart rate is coming down, too.

706
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,470
体温38.3度
Temperature is 101.

707
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,430
好了  干得漂亮  各位
Okay. Nice work, everyone.

708
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:17,660
非常感谢
Thank you very much.

709
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:20,500
泰瑞·福克斯
Terry Fox.

710
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,310
要不就是我个人的最爱  吉姆·阿伯特
Or my personal favorite -- Jim Abbott.

711
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:36,510
进来
Come in.

712
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:44,630
我想和你谈谈科利医生的事
I need to talk to you about Dr. Coyle.

713
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,070
布朗医生
Dr. Browne.

714
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,040
我也想和你说同样的事情
I wanted to talk to you about the same thing.

715
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,740
请吧
Please.

716
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,260
手术很成功
The surgery was a success.

717
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:12,440
结果比预想的要好
And the outcome might be better than expected.

718
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:15,370
你左边还是会有明显的神经功能障碍
There will still be significant neurological dysfunction

719
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:18,300
但是没我们预想的那么严重
on your left side, but not as much as we'd anticipated.

720
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:21,210
酷毙了
Sick!

721
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:24,700
谢谢
Thank you.

722
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,630
你做得很好  朋友
You did good, my friend.

723
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,520
你得耐心点
You have to be patient.

724
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,820
不要
Nah.

725
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,660
有耐心是一件坏事吗
Is patience a bad thing?

726
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:53,170
接受才是一件坏事
Acceptance is a bad thing.

727
00:37:57,670 --> 00:38:03,200
我小时候不擅长玩抛接子游戏
When I was a kid, I -- I wasn't good at jack.

728
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:07,560
但我从没放弃
But I never quit.

729
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:10,050
我...
I...

730
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,290
成功了
found my thing.

731
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:21,310
永远都不要让别人告诉你
Don't ever let anyone tell you

732
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:25,930
你能做什么  不能...
what you can and can't...

733
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:28,450
做什么...
do.

734
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:58,370
昨晚的事对不起
I'm sorry. For last night.

735
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:02,350
昨天过得很不顺  我很累
It was a rough day. I was tired.

736
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,020
也许有点太...
Probably had a few too...

737
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:08,000
你和你爸的关系是你的事...
Your relationship with your father is your business --

738
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,290
尼尔  你不用这样
Neil, you don't have to.

739
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,500
我会给你爸打电话
I'll call your dad, and --

740
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,640
我不想要孩子
I don't want to have kids.

741
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:38,820
肖恩  我送你回家
Shaun, I'm gonna drive you home.

742
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,810
你会见到梅利莎
You're gonna see Melissa.

743
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:43,470
如果你不喜欢她  她就会离开
If you don't like her, she'll leave.

744
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,980
但是不要再逃避了
But there's no more running away.

745
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:49,630
你觉得我为什么要这么做
Why do you think I'm doing this?

746
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:52,350
因为你很固执
Because you are stubborn.

747
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:55,310
好吧  是的  好  你说得对  我很固执
Ok-Okay, yeah, okay, sure. I'm stubborn.

748
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:57,630
但是我这都是为了你  好吗
But I'm doing this for you, okay?

749
00:39:57,830 --> 00:39:59,310
这样你就可以过上更好的生活
So that you can have a better life,

750
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:01,400
过上更开心的生活
so that you can have a happier life.

751
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:04,500
如果这不会让我开心呢
What if it doesn't make me happy?

752
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:07,550
如果这不会让我开心呢
What if it doesn't make me happy?

753
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:10,210
如果这只让你感到开心呢
What if it only makes you happy?

754
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:14,360
你觉得我这么做是为了让自己开心
You think -- You think I'm doing this to make me happy?

755
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,110
我不开心  肖恩
I'm not happy, Shaun.

756
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:19,010
我一点也不开心  你知道吗
I'm not close to being happy, and you know what?

757
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:20,650
我不想再解释了
I am done explaining,

758
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:23,660
我不想再讨好你  我不想再说了
I am done bribing, and I am done talking.

759
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:24,950
-现在快走吧  -不  不不  不
- Now let's go. - No. N-No. No!

760
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:26,430
-走  -不
- Let's go! - No!

761
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:27,460
不
No.

762
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:31,280
不  我  我想自己做决定
No, I -- I want to make my own decisions.

763
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,840
-我...  -肖恩  你能小点声吗  拜托
- I -- - Shaun, can you keep your voice down, please? Please?

764
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:36,120
你不能一直这么命令我
You -- You cannot keep ordering me around, okay?

765
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:37,680
你不是我爸
You're not my father!

766
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:40,950
我知道
I know that.

767
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:43,880
肖恩  我不明白
Shaun, I don't understand...

768
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:47,020
好  你不想...为什么这让你如此苦恼
Okay.You don't let ...why this is so upsetting.

769
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:49,260
-有人告诉过你能做什么不能做什么  -我不明白
- Anyone ever tell you what you can and can't do.-- - I don't get it.

770
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:52,190
肖恩  冷静点  拜托
Shaun, let's just calm down now, please.

771
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:54,510
-好了  好了  -永远都不要让别人告诉你
- Okay, okay. - Don't let anyone

772
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:55,670
你能做什么  不能做什么
ever tell you what you can and can't do!

773
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:56,840
冷静点  肖恩  别这样
Hey, just calm -- Shaun. Hey,

774
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,090
-我想自己做决定  -肖恩
- I want to make my own decisions. - Shaun.

775
00:40:58,090 --> 00:41:00,240
-我想自己做决定  -好  好  好
- I want to make my own decisions! - Okay, okay, okay.

776
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,990
-我只是想帮忙  -我想自己做...
- I'm just trying to help. - I want make my own --

777
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:03,220
-我不需要帮忙  -肖恩
- I don't want help! - Shaun!

778
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:05,820
我...
I --

779
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,340
你在想什么
What were you thinking?!

780
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:21,720
我不需要你为我打架
I do not need you to fight my battles,

781
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,990
我也没有要求你这样做过
and I certainly never asked you to.

782
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:26,200
如果你真的尊重我的话
And if you really respected me,

783
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,270
你就不会像对待一个
you would not treat me like some damsel

784
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:29,500
需要保护的小姑娘似的对待我
who needed protection, okay?

785
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,960
你会给予我
You would treat me with the respect

786
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,310
应有的尊重
that you would automatically give to a man.

787
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:36,520
你会像对待有能力处理自己生活的人一样对待我
You'd treat me like a person capable of handling her own life!

788
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:39,950
也许  也许这对你要求太多了
And maybe -- maybe it's too much to ask of you.

789
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,770
很显然安德鲁斯同意你的看法
Apparently Andrews agrees with you.

790
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:46,780
我因为殴打同事被解雇了
I've just been fired for physically assaulting an employee.

791
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:55,600
肖恩  肖恩
Shaun? Shaun!

792
00:41:56,770 --> 00:41:57,800
他去哪了
Where would he go?

793
00:41:58,150 --> 00:41:59,900
有他想去的地方吗
Is there a place he likes to hang out,

794
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,390
他觉得舒服的地方
a place where he feels comfortable?

795
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:02,570
不  我不知道
No, I don't know.

796
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:04,260
他不在医院
I mean, he's not at the hospital.

797
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:08,850
以前这里有一张肖恩和...
And there used to be a picture here of Shaun...

798
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:12,490
他弟史蒂夫的照片
and his brother, Steve.

799
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:15,710
你觉得这是什么意思
What do you think that means?

800
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,410
意思是他不会回来了
It means he's not coming back.
