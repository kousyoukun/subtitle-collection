- What happened? ?- Nothing.

30
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,830
只是大厅在为大型派对做准备
They're just getting the lobby ready for the big party.

31
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:54,510
是年度募捐活动
It's an annual fundraiser.

32
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:55,950
嘉年华那种吗
Like a carnival?

33
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:59,400
不  是西装革履的时尚舞会
No, it's a swanky, black-tie ball.

34
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,920
医院大厅也算得上时尚
You think a hospital lobby is swanky?

35
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,500
现在不算  但点上灯  装饰一下
Not yet, but add some lights, a few decorations,

36
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,870
最重要的是要有酒
and, most importantly, alcohol...

37
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:08,400
那也不过是彩带招摇  气球飘飘
It becomes a streamer- and balloon-infested hospital lobby

38
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,810
有饮料柜台的医院大厅
with a cash bar.

39
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:11,410
这是慈善舞会
It's for charity.

40
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:13,680
钱最好用在刀刃上
Better to spend the money for the cause.

41
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,030
其实更糟
Actually, it's worse.

42
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:16,810
要花钱才能挣到钱
You need to spend money to make money.

43
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,590
我不喜欢派对
I don't like parties.

44
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:19,340
没关系
Doesn't matter.

45
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:23,060
全体住院医师都将出席并捐款
All residents will be expected to attend and make a donation.

46
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,380
这位是亚历克斯·朴医生
This is Dr. Alex Park.

47
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:25,720
他是科利带的住院医师中
He's the last of Coyle's residents

48
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,450
最后一位分到我们团队的医生
to be reassigned to our team.

49
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,130
他们分别是杰瑞德·卡卢医生
Meet doctors Jared Kalu,

50
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,380
克莱尔·布朗医生  肖恩·莫菲医生
Claire Browne, and Shaun Murphy.

51
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,890
幸会
Nice to meet you.

52
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:35,290
欢迎回归  哥斯达黎加如何
Welcome back. How was Costa Rica?

53
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:36,990
沙滩很美  猴子很凶
Beaches were awesome. Monkeys were horrible.

54
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,610
小家伙偷了我的新相机和一副...
Little bastards stole my new camera and a pair of --

55
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:40,160
你多大了
How old are you?

56
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:41,650
45岁
45.

57
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:44,310
比梅伦德斯医生还老
That's even older than Dr. Melendez.

58
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,030
莫菲是一位患有自闭症  天赋极高的医生
Dr. Murphy is a talented doctor who has autism,

59
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:49,850
所以有时会问出不得体的问题
which sometimes causes him to ask inappropriate questions.

60
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:52,480
没事  不得体的问题或许能发人深省
No worries. Inappropriate questions can be very revealing.

61
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:53,410
我算是大器晚成
I'm a late bloomer.

62
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:56,450
朴谦虚了  不像他的作风
Park's being modest, which is very unlike him.

63
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,480
他念医学院之前当了十五年的警察
He was a cop for 15 years before he went to med school.

64
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:02,010
既然大家都认识了
Now that we all know each other,

65
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:05,160
雷兹尼克和布朗这周要协助手术
Reznick and Browne have dibs on cases this week.

66
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,330
你们自己选
You make your picks?

67
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,490
-好  -没问题
- Yes. - Definitely.

68
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:09,400
有卡拉OK吗
Is there karaoke?

69
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:12,170
现在有请全明星阵容登场
And now, our all-star lineup!

70
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:15,010
主要活跃于萨斯喀彻温省穆斯乔市之外
Playing center, out of Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan.

71
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:17,340
斯普里特  停下
Spirit, stop it.

72
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,820
他们没时间陪你胡闹
They don't have time to fool around.

73
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:19,960
我没在胡闹
I'm not fooling around.

74
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,240
我得记录这一重大事件
I need to document the momentous event.

75
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,600
那起码别搞错了
Then at least get it right.

76
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,100
我来自台湾台北
I'm from Taipei, Taiwan.

77
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,760
纠正
Co-o-orrection!

78
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:28,600
来自台湾台北
From Taipei, Taiwan --

79
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,650
应该是穆斯乔市郊区的...
which I believe is a suburb of Moose Jaw --

80
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,210
奥德丽·利姆医生
Dr. Audrey Lim!

81
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:37,440
利姆医生的助手是...
And assisting Dr. Lim are...

82
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,530
我没见过的两位医生
two docs I've never met.

83
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,260
你好
Hello.

84
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:44,930
我是来自怀俄明州卡斯珀的肖恩·莫菲医生
I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy from Casper, Wyoming.

85
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:46,680
那这位
And...?

86
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,910
我是加利福尼亚州米尔谷的摩根·雷兹尼克医生
Dr. Morgan Reznick, Mill Valley, California.

87
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,270
闪亮登场
Represent!

88
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,890
好了  斯普里特  够了
Okay, Spirit, that's enough.

89
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,270
把你的手机收好
All right, put your phone away,

90
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,760
不然我就没收了
or it becomes my phone.

91
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,260
各位  这位西装男不让我录了
Well, folks, looks like the suits are shuttin' me down.

92
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,600
感谢大家的支持
Thanks for all your support.

93
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,470
爱你们  拜
Love you! Bye!

94
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:05,550
抱歉  我的朋友们想知道我的最新情况
Sorry, but my friends insist I keep them up to date.

95
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,400
没关系  今天很重要
It's all right. It's a big day.

96
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,750
斯普里特有天生的心脏异位  她一直...
Spirit was born with ectopia cordis. She's been --

97
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,790
怎么没在婴儿时期帮她修复心脏
Why didn't they repair it when she was an infant?

98
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,780
没办法  当时她的肋骨架太小了
They couldn't. Her rib cage was too small.

99
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,750
等她缓慢稳定地长到十四岁后
But after 14 years of slow and steady growth...

100
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,370
是时候送这宝贝回老家了
It's time to put this baby where it belongs.

101
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:30,950

103
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:39,980
这个画面非常神奇
This is an interesting view.

104
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,140
我能看到主动脉弓
I can see the aortic arch.

105
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,720
-莫菲  -没关系
- Murphy. - Oh, it's all right.

106
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,840
我习惯人们好奇的眼光了
I'm used to people being curious.

107
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,950
你肯定很期待
I'm sure you're looking forward

108
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:49,130
没人再用好奇的眼光看你
to when there's nothing to be curious about.

109
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:52,800
我真正期待的是...去人多的地方
What I'm really looking forward to is...crowds.

110
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,360
你喜欢人多的地方
You like crowds?

111
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:56,590
不知道
I don't know.

112
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,240
我从没去过
I've never been in one.

113
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,640
我没法念普通的学校
I can't go to a normal school,

114
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:02,270
我的父母几乎不让我离开家
and my parents barely ever let me leave our house.

115
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:04,990
这颗小肿块可能让你心脏停跳  情理之中
Well, when a small bump could stop your heart, it makes sense.

116
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:07,420
但你还是有很多朋友
But you still have a lot of friends?

117
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,200
对  当然了
Yeah, of course.

118
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:10,620
只是不能跟他们痛快地玩耍
I mean, I just can't do anything fun with them.

119
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,280
要是不能痛快地玩耍
If you can't do anything fun,

120
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,460
那怎么跟他们交上朋友的
then how did you get them to be your friend?

121
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,500
提醒你一下吧
Well, in case you haven't noticed,

122
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,100
我喜欢聊天
I like to talk.

123
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,240
-对  -而且现在什么事都可以网上操作
- Yes. - ?And, we all do everything online now anyway.

124
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,720
等我出院后第一件事就是
The first thing I'm gonna do when I get out of here

125
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,630
带我的朋友去听音乐会
is take all my friends to a concert.

126
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,650
就是那种最低价的普通门票
Like, general admission, on the floor.

127
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:30,810
我甚至不在乎是哪支乐队
I don't even care who the band is,

128
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:32,870
只要那里到处都是人
just as long as the place is packed.

129
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,340
我还要拥抱所有人
And I'm gonna hug everyone.

130
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,780
你从没拥抱过谁吗
You've never hugged anyone?

131
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:36,940
连父母都没抱过吗
Not even your parents?

132
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,730
亲吻父母  跟朋友击掌庆祝
Kissed by my parents, high-fived by my friends,

133
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:42,000
但没拥抱过
but, nope, no hugs.

134
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
太危险了
It's just too risky.

135
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:48,100
拥抱让我感觉很束缚
Hugs make me feel trapped.

136
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:51,080
抱歉
?Sorry.

137
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,240
就快好了
Almost done.

138
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,290
右上腹疼痛
Pain in the upper-right quadrant.

139
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:55,780
是黄疸
It's jaundice.

140
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,270
胆红素飙升
Bilirubin's off the chart.

141
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,680
没道理啊
That doesn't make sense.

142
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,600
移植术之后他一直恢复得很好
He's been doing so well since the transplant.

143
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,150
今年每次检查都很正常
Yeah, every check-up this year's been perfect.

144
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:04,140
可能只是暂时的复发
Well, it could just be a temporary flare-up.

145
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,800
我们会加大抗排异药用量
We'll increase his anti-rejection meds

146
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:07,240
做全肝检查
and do a full liver exam.

147
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,490
到时就会更明确
We'll know more then.

148
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,300
你俩去做检查
You two, do the work-up.

149
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,820
你去找新的肝脏
And you find a new liver.

150
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,260
不该等活检结果吗
Shouldn't we wait for the biopsy result?

151
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,200
我已经知道结果了
Not when I already know what it's gonna say.

152
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,260
得立即给他找新的肝脏
He needs a new liver ASAP.

153
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,490
没那么容易
I mean, that's gonna be hard.

154
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:28,630
他是O型血
He's Blood Type O.

155
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:29,520
这几乎不可能
It's gonna be impossible.

156
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,150
最初能找到就已经很幸运了
He's lucky they were able to find the first one.

157
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,400
他最好又能好运
Well, he better get lucky again

158
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,450
因为只有这个办法才能保住他的命
because it's our only way to keep him alive.

159
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,990
完蛋了
We're screwed.

160
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,290
芭芭拉·伯克斯在科苏梅尔岛水肺潜水时
Barbara Boxer got ear barotrauma scuba-diving in Cozumel

161
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:42,450
造成了耳部气压伤  两周内不能坐飞机
and cannot fly for two weeks,

162
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:45,490
就是说没人在庆典上做主旨讲话了
which means we don't have a keynote speaker for our gala.

163
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,320
你觉得很好笑吗
You think this is funny?

164
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:50,850
我只是没见过你焦虑的样子
I've just never seen you anxious,

165
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:54,790
而且我很怀疑芭芭拉·伯克斯会水肺潜水
and I seriously doubt Barbara Boxer scuba-dives.

166
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,780
只是借口而已
It's just an excuse.

167
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,390
她给我发了在医院的照片
She sent me a picture from the hospital.

168
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,400
-真的吗  -真的
- Really? - Yeah.

169
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,030
谁都可以伪造照片
Anyone can fake a photograph.

170
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:00,920
你在干什么
What are you doing?

171
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,880
我在搜我们伟大的加利福尼亚州参议员
I am doing a search to see if our esteemed senator

172
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,730
在接受采访时有没有  哪怕一次
from the great state of California ever once -- once --

173
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,030
谈到过自己会水肺潜水
talked about scuba-diving in an interview.

174
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,150
真假不重要
It doesn't matter if it's true.

175
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:13,750
重要的是得找个人替代她
What matters is that we find a replacement.

176
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,930
我需要你帮我安排跟艾登·柯尔特见面
I need you to get me a meeting with Aiden Coulter.

177
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:17,370
-艾登·柯尔特  -对
- Aiden Coulter? ?- Yes.

178
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:20,790
我只是有次在奥克兰运动队比赛时坐他旁边而已
What? I sat next to him once at an A's game.

179
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,030
我记得当时
And the story I remember is that

180
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:24,460
你俩聊了一整晚
you two were talking smack that entire game,

181
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,300
他还在把啤酒洒你身上后
and after he spilled his beer on you

182
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,380
坚持要给你买件新的外套
and insisted on buying you a new jacket,

183
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,610
而你拒绝了
you refused him.

184
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,930
所以他欠你个人情
So he owes you.

185
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:32,050
安排我跟他见面
Just get me a meeting.

186
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,970
之后的事交给我就好
I'll handle everything from there.

187
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:36,120
好
Okay.

188
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,790
我会想想办法
I'll see what I can do.

189
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,610
-谢谢  -不客气
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

190
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:44,740
芭芭拉·伯克斯会水肺潜水吗

191
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,340
没事的
You'll be fine.

192
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,980
你之前做过肝脏活检
You've had liver biopsies before.

193
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,970
而那非常疼
And they've always hurt a lot.

194
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,530
求你了  没其他办法吗
Please, isn't there another way?

195
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:00,810
埃里克  其他办法就得从脖子下手
Well, the other way, Eric, would going through your neck,

196
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,750
我认为你不会喜欢那样的
and I don't think you'd like that any more.

197
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,500
埃里克  你知道为什么NBA球员
Eric, do you know why NBA players

198
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,570
比赛前都戴耳机吗
all wear headphones before games?

199
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,780
别看他  看着我
Don't look at him. Look at me.

200
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,240
我需要你回答我
I need you to answer me.

201
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:12,370
为什么NBA球员比赛前戴耳机
Why do NBA players wear headphones before games?

202
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:13,490
不知道
I don't know.

203
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,240
也许他们喜欢音乐
I guess they like music.

204
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,770
不  他们需要音乐
No, they need music.

205
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,110
音乐帮助他们忘记纷扰
Music helps them forget about everything else

206
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:20,800
只聚焦于重要的事情
and focus on what's important --

207
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,890
就是比赛
the game.

208
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:24,560
你最喜欢的球员是谁
Who's your favorite player?

209
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,560
库里
Curry.

210
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:26,800
好的
Okay.

211
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,270
这是他每次比赛前听的歌曲
This is the song he listens to before every game.

212
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:31,990
你怎么知道的
How do you know?

213
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:34,070
因为他也是我最爱的球员
Because he's my favorite player, too.

214
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:38,730
我希望你闭上眼睛集中于此
I want you to close your eyes and focus on this.

215
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:40,150
就够了
Just this.

216
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:43,500
好冷
It's cold.

217
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,200
现在确实  但只要你集中精神
Yeah, now it is, but if you stay focused,

218
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,020
很快就不会感觉冷了
pretty soon, it'll stop feeling cold

219
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,300
并开始感觉温暖
and start to feel warm.

220
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,130
当你觉得暖了  你就点下头
When that happens, I want you to nod your head,

221
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:53,560
你同时会有一些按压以及痛感
and you'll feel some pressure and a small pinch.

222
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:54,700
如果那样...
What if it does --

223
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,750
那就闭上眼睛集中精神
Then close your eyes and focus.

224
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:03,730
准备好了吗
You ready?

225
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,170
只需两分钟他就可以手术了
Two minutes and he'll be good to go.

226
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:21,440
你怎么知道他是个篮球迷
How'd you know he was a basketball fan?

227
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,490
他的鞋子
His shoes.

228
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,400
他没有穿鞋子
He's not wearing any shoes.

229
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,430
鞋在他房间的背包里
Yeah, they're in a backpack in his room.

230
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,830
你翻了他的背包吗
You searched his backpack?

231
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:33,570
这没有直肠癌那么有攻击性
Well, it's, um, less invasive than a rectal,

232
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:35,540
而且更多时候还很有用
and most of the time more useful.

233
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,620
斯普里特  保持冷静
Okay, Spirit, just keep still and --

234
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,900
在检查的过程中
And during a few parts of the exam,

235
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:44,240
我可能需要你屏住呼吸
we may ask you to hold your breath,

236
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,250
但只需要几秒钟
but it'll only be a few seconds.

237
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,640
你都懂的
You got it.

238
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,500
你准备买件燕尾服还是租一件
You gonna buy a tux or rent one?

239
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,990
募捐晚宴要求正规着装
The fundraiser is black tie.

240
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,740
我有一件西服
I have a suit.

241
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,740
是新的
It's new.

242
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:01,540
我为了面试住院医师买的
I bought it for my resident interviews.

243
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,380
多新都不重要
It doesn't matter how new it is.

244
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,850
它不是燕尾服
It's not a tux.

245
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,960
工作时穿制服使病人心安
Wearing a uniform at work reassures patients.

246
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,170
在派对穿制服没有任何作用
Wearing a uniform at a party does nothing

247
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:13,690
只会让你很热  并且不舒服
but make you hot and uncomfortable.

248
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,470
这个派对就是工作
This party is work.

249
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:16,550
去弄一件燕尾服
Get a tux.

250
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:18,670
别买廉价经销店的劣质款
And not a crappy one from some outlet store.

251
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:21,240
去买件由专业人士定制的西装  至少花个两千
Get fitted by a pro and spend a minimum of two grand.

252
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,190
你会遇见可以帮助你事业的富豪
You're gonna meet rich people who can help your career,

253
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,790
他们可不愿意帮助邋遢的人
and they're not gonna want to help some slob in a --

254
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,600
我不邋遢
I'm not a slob.

255
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,210
我很干净
No, I am very clean

256
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:30,500
而且我的衣服从来不起皱
and make sure my clothes are never wrinkled.

257
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,710
这太大了
And it's too big.

258
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:34,930
她的心脏
Her heart.

259
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:39,740
和她上次检查相比增大了53%
It's enlarged 53% since her last exam.

260
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,570
她上次检查不过是六个月前
Her last exam was only six months ago.

261
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:43,910
这样不行
It won't fit.

262
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,330
太大了
Too big.

263
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,860
活组织检查确定了急性细胞排斥反应
The biopsy confirmed acute cellular rejection.

264
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,700
他的免疫抑制剂已经加到最大了  但...
We maximized his immuno-suppressives, but, uh --

265
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:53,340
我们找到了一个O型肝源
I found one -- a Type-O liver.

266
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,410
你确定吗
Are you sure?

267
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,800
朴和我查过登记中心  并没有什么发现
Park and I checked the registry, and there weren't any.

268
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,110
我在网上发现的
I found it online.

269
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:01,020
他在几个月前试图直接捐赠
He, uh -- He already tried to make a direct donation a few months ago,

270
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,390
但病人在手术前去世了
but the patient died before the surgery.

271
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,860
我联络了他  这并不简单
I contacted him, which wasn't easy,

272
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,720
但他仍愿意捐赠
but he still wants to be a donor.

273
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:09,650
太好了
That's amazing.

274
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:10,790
干得好
Great job.

275
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,340
这里面有什么鬼
What's the catch?

276
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,770
他想成为捐赠者却不在登记中心里
He wants to be a donor, but he's not on the registry?

277
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:16,630
肯定有鬼
I mean, there's got to be a catch.

278
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,860
他不能进入登记中心
He, uh -- He can't be on the registry

279
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,950
因为他在监狱里
because he is in prison.

280
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,230
由于杀人
For murder.

281
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:27,740
事实上  七次杀人案
Actually, um, seven murders.

282
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:34,830
鲍里斯·提拉延是俄罗斯黑手党杀手
Boris Tirayan was a Russian Mafia enforcer

283
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:36,530
犯了七宗杀人案
convicted of seven murders.

284
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:38,330
现在想将功补过
Who now wants to make amends.

285
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:40,020
几个月前他尝试成为捐赠者
He tried to be a donor a few months ago,

286
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:42,930
但在通过繁文缛节之前  病人去世了
but the patient died before the red tape could be worked out.

287
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:44,530
但现在...
But now that it has...

288
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:47,460
有法律禁止囚犯成为捐赠者的吗
Are there any laws against an inmate becoming a donor?

289
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:50,000
不  但这牵扯到许多责任
No, but there is a ton of liability.

290
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,160
如果他在这里袭击其他人呢
What if he attacks someone here?

291
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,600
他会被监狱守卫看守护送
He'll be guarded by state prison guards on a separate level,

292
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:55,780
与所有不相关的病人和工作人员隔离开
away from patients and all non-essential staff.

293
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,810
每个人都应有机会改变自己的生活
Everyone deserves the chance to turn their life around.

294
00:10:57,810 --> 00:10:59,850
他想做些好事
The guy wants to do something decent,

295
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:00,780
我们应该允许
we should let him.

296
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,940
我不认为我们欠一个杀人犯什么
I don't think we owe a murderer anything.

297
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,630
但也许他欠了我们一些东西
But maybe he owes us something.

298
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,100
他亏欠于社会
He has a debt to society.

299
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,540
他会通过捐赠体内器官来偿还
Which he would repay by donating his inner organs.

300
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:12,420
这不是自讨苦吃吗  一个人想将功补过
Isn't it a slippery slope between a guy who wants to make amends

301
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:15,850
结果却把监狱系统变成了人体组织仓库
and turning our prison system into a superstore for body parts?

302
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:18,470
可以拯救孩子生命的自讨苦吃
A slippery slope that saves a child's life.

303
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:20,100
不可能的
It'll never happen.

304
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,700
他只是想进入医院以便逃跑
He's just trying to get a hospital, where it'll be easier to escape.

305
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,860
你根本不知道他的动机是什么
You have no idea what his motivation is.

306
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,810
我知道他是个骗人的反社会者
I know he's a lying sociopath

307
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:28,260
不在乎别人只在乎自己
who doesn't care about anyone but himself.

308
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,630
他九年来都是模范囚犯
He's been a model inmate for nine years,

309
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,340
在图书馆指导别的囚犯
tutors other prisoners in the library --

310
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,850
因为他需要别人相信他
Yeah, because he's trying to get someone to trust him,

311
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:36,010
给他一些甜头  只要他们这样做了
to give him an inch, and as soon as they do --

312
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,190
我们得到了批准
We got approval.

313
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,100
他肯定会借故拖延
He's gonna stall, make excuses,

314
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,090
然后等他找到时机
and when he sees his chance,

315
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,340
就会有人受伤
someone's gonna get hurt.

316
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:44,210
我觉得值得冒险
I think it's worth taking that chance.

317
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:47,990
任何不同意的人都可以不参加
Anybody who doesn't agree, feel free to sit this one out.

318
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:53,100
当你来月经时
When you started menstruating,

319
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,060
增加的雌激素导致肺动脉高压
the increased estrogen caused pulmonary hypertension,

320
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,160
这不是手术的问题
which isn't a surgical issue in itself,

321
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,510
但由于你的非典型血管系统
but along with your atypical vascular system --

322
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:03,150
你的心脏长得太大了
Your heart's grown too big.

323
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,340
我们会控制你的血压
We will control your blood pressure

324
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,980
这样你会继续发育但你的心脏不会
so that you will keep growing but your heart won't,

325
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,680
等你到十八岁我们就可以...
and then, by the time you're 18, we'll able to --

326
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:10,690
不
No.

327
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:12,690
我不想再等了
I'm not waiting any longer.

328
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,090
斯普里特  宝贝  没事的
Spirit, honey, it will be okay.

329
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,430
才不是
No, it won't!

330
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,470
我受不了一直被关在里面
I'm sick of being stuck inside all the time.

331
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:21,060
我受不了
I'm sick of this!

332
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,380
我不想再发短信  打电话  或者视频了
I don't ever want to text, call, or video chat again.

333
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:27,680
妈妈  我想和人接触
Mom, I want to be touched.

334
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,520
我想被推挤
I want to be shoved.

335
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,380
我想挨打
I want to be punched.

336
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,160
我根本不在乎  只是...
I don't even care, just --

337
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,790
拜托了
Please.

338
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:39,910
拜托了
Please.

339
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,540
我想现在就进行手术
I want this surgery now.

340
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,310
我需要它
I need it.

341
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:56,630
对不起  我们做不到
I'm sorry. We can't.

342
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,240
我们需要弄走所有家具和艺术作品
We need to get rid of all the furniture and artwork.

343
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,710
我可以移走画作  但家具怎么办
I get removing the paintings, but the furniture?

344
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,240
我可不希望监狱守卫在工作时游手好闲
Don't want the prison guards sitting down on the job.

345
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,100
他会被全面限制
He's gonna be in full restraints,

346
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,430
被拷在床上
cuffed to the bed.

347
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,590
这是我们的计划
Well, that's our plan,

348
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:19,190
但我们也需要为他的计划做准备
but we also need to be prepared for his plan.

349
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:21,030
我们需要弄走遮光帘
Okay, we need to get rid of the window blinds,

350
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:21,990
挂帘杆和外套挂钩
curtain rods, jacket hooks,

351
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:23,610
确定没有任何金属铆钉
and make sure there's no metal rivets

352
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,300
床垫上没有金属圈
or eyelets on the mattress.

353
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,260
他能用金属圈做什么
What's he gonna do with a metal eyelet?

354
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,890
把它从床垫下弄下来然后锉光滑
Tear it off the mattress and file it down

355
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:30,860
切断你的颈静脉或把它掰成手铐钥匙
to cut your jugular, or bend it into a handcuff key,

356
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:33,190
或者把它变成电源插头
or shove it into an electric socket

357
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:35,310
制造火花从而引发火灾
to create a spark and start a fire.

358
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,440
我见过用厕纸肥皂和盐制成的刀
I've seen knives made out of toilet paper, soap, and salt

359
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,930
可以切断一个肥胖男子的股骨
that could amputate a fat guy's femur.

360
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:54,300
不知道他为何要特意提胖子
Not quite sure he needed the part about the guy being fat.

361
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,040
我在想
So...I've been thinking.

362
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:01,490
你想一起去募捐晚宴吗
You want to go to the fundraiser together?

363
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:03,960
不是高校舞会  我们不用携伴参加
It's not a prom. We don't have to bring a date.

364
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,610
是啊  我们不需要
Yeah, we don't have to.

365
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:09,020
但如果我们想  也可以
But we can, if we want.

366
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:11,770
基本上每个人都知道我们在约会
Everyone basically knows we're seeing each other,

367
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:12,710
但是
but still...

368
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,930
我觉得这是个很好的机会
I think it might be a nice opportunity

369
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:18,940
公开我们的关系
to take our relationship out into the open.

370
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,760
除非你不愿意
Unless you don't want to.

371
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:25,080
不  这是个好主意
No, it's a good idea.

372
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,110
你确定吗
Are you sure?

373
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:27,730
你知道我们不用非得这样
Because, you know, we don't have to.

374
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:30,140
就这么做吧
Yeah. Let's do it.

375
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:36,950
我们走
Let's go.

376
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:39,680
怎么了
What's wrong?

377
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:41,650
没什么  他会好起来的
It's fine. He'll be all right.

378
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:43,570
我不  我不想要杀人犯的肝脏
No, I won't. I don't want a murderer's liver!

379
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:44,820
太邪恶了
It's evil!

380
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,890
埃里克  肝脏没有好坏之分
Eric, there's no such thing as a good or bad liver.

381
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:50,070
它只是...只是个器官
It's just a -- just an organ.

382
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:51,890
埃里克  这是你唯一的选择了
Eric, this is your only choice.

383
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:55,140
如果我们不做移植  你会死的
If we don't do the transplant, you will die.

384
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,440
我不想让他成为我的一部分
I don't want him to be a part of me,

385
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,550
永远待在我身体里
inside me forever, all right?

386
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:00,600
我不管你或者其他人怎么说
I don't care what you or anybody else says, okay?

387
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,590
这是我的身体  我不想接受
It's my body, and I don't want it!

388
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:08,530
简直荒谬
That's ridiculous.

389
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:11,230
人格特征不会通过器官移植转移到受体
Personality traits aren't transferred in an organ transplant.

390
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:12,430
而且这之间毫无关联
It's also irrelevant.

391
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:14,050
孩子无权同意是否手术
Children don't consent to surgeries --

392
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,300
他们的父母才有权
their parents do.

393
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,690
但如果他不遵医嘱进行抗排异治疗
But if he doesn't cooperate with the anti-rejection regimen,

394
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:20,020
我们就会浪费本可以救另一个人的肝脏
we could be wasting a liver that could save someone else's life.

395
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,230
提拉延救不了任何人
No one's getting saved by Tirayan.

396
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:23,000
我找到一位A型捐献者  不完全匹配  但
I found a Type-A donor. It's not a perfect match, but --

397
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,150
他都对一个完全匹配的肝脏有排异反应了
His body's already rejected a perfect match.

398
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:27,440
血型不匹配的话根本不可能成功
There's no way it can tolerate an incompatible blood type.

399
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,050
不  唯一能救埃里克的方法
No, the only way to save Eric

400
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:31,270
就是用提拉延的肝脏进行移植
is to do the transplant with Tirayan's liver.

401
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,180
只有这样
That is it.

402
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,180
我们别无选择
We have no other option.

403
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:40,080
告诉手术室我们需要更多约束带
Let the O.R. know we're gonna need more restraints.

404
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,740
阿尔伯塔省的克林顿·福特医生
Dr. Clinton Ford out of Alberta

405
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:46,490
研发了一种实验性的可吸收材料
developed an experimental resorbable material.

406
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:48,570
可以让我们扩展她的胸腔
It would allow us to expand her rib cage

407
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:50,890
创造足够容纳她心脏的空间
and create room to fit her heart inside.

408
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:52,310
一片人造胸骨
An artificial sternum.

409
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:55,050
它可以和患者一起成长
That would actually grow along with the patient.

410
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:57,630
这个手术是不可逆的
The surgery isn't reversible.

411
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:58,820
如果不起效
If it doesn't work,

412
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:01,680
《小儿外科手术学刊》

413
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,590
我们不能将她的心脏挪回原位
we can't just move her heart back to where it was.

414
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:03,300
但这能让她享受生活
It would allow her to have a life.

415
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,730
她有自己的生活
She has a life,

416
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:07,850
只要她远离人群  不拥抱任何人
and she'll be healthy as long as she stays out of crowds,

417
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:08,820
或者不做可能会让自己摔倒的事
doesn't hug anyone,

418
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:10,410
她会保持健康的
or do anything where she might fall.

419
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:11,900
我知道你有自闭症
I get you're autistic,

420
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,570
但我也知道即使是你  你也能意识到
but I know even you realize when a patient cries

421
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,230
当一位患者大哭并向墙上扔手机的时候
and throws her phone against the wall,

422
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:18,090
他们对自己当前的健康状况并不满意
they're not happy with their current health.

423
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:19,800
你没必要针对他
There's no reason to make this personal.

424
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,750
如果他的医疗决策有偏颇  那就有
There is if his medical judgment is biased.

425
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,390
我看到她不开心
I saw she was upset.

426
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,230
你看到了  但你不理解
You saw it, but you didn't understand it.

427
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:30,320
你很好胜
You're very competitive.

428
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:34,490
你是不是试图让利姆医生觉得我有偏见
Are you trying to make Dr. Lim think I'm biased,

429
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,000
还是你想让我丧失自信
or are you trying to undermine my confidence?

430
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,770
我其实是在帮助你和患者
I'm actually trying to help you and the patient.

431
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:41,310
她想要和人亲近互动
She wants to be able to rub elbows,

432
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:43,610
你就要去想怎么才能做到
and you need to learn how to trade elbows.

433
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:48,240
可吸收板材还在实验阶段  有一定风险
The resorbable plate is experimental and risky.

434
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:53,120
但我的医疗决策是  这值得一试
But my medical judgment is that it's worth it.

435
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:56,490
一定要让她同意  做好术前准备
Make sure she agrees and then get her prepped.

436
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,090
为什么是我
Why me?

437
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,550
我没什么名气  我对医药一无所知
I'm not famous, I don't know anything about medicine,

438
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:08,780
在你们的募捐晚宴上让我做致辞
and giving the keynote speech at your fundraiser

439
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:11,740
比起被啤酒弄脏的夹克  这人情还得太多了
is a steep price to pay for a beer-stained jacket.

440
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,700
你在圣何塞长大
You grew up in San Jose.

441
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:19,180
虽然你被普林斯顿和麻省理工双双录取
You went to San Jose State

442
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:22,850
但你却去了圣何塞州立大学
despite being accepted by both Princeton and MIT,

443
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:24,840
面对芝加哥和明尼安纳波利斯的巨额税收优惠
and you headquartered your company here,

444
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:28,180
你还是将公司总部设在这里
despite huge tax breaks offered by Chicago and Minneapolis.

445
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,550
而且那是他最喜欢的夹克
And it was his favorite jacket.

446
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:30,740
当我提出要清理他的夹克时
Well, when I offered to have it cleaned,

447
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:33,240
他说不用费心  因为他根本不喜欢那件夹克
he said not to bother because he didn't even like the jacket.

448
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,310
-他只是在说客套话  -客套话
- He was being polite. ?- Polite?

449
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:37,600
我知道你一定没和他比赛过
I take it you've never been to a game with him.

450
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,640
你做了功课  但还不够
You did some homework, but not enough.

451
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,710
我爱这座城市  但我痛恨致辞
I love this city, but I hate giving speeches.

452
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:46,000
那就不要致辞
So don't give a speech.

453
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,770
给我们讲个故事
Tell us a story.

454
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,430
就像你在青年舞蹈团
Like the one you told at the wrap party

455
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:51,110
秋季音乐剧庆功宴上讲的那个
at the Youth Dance company's fall musical --

456
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:53,800
你在巴黎地下墓场迷路的故事
the one where you got lost at the Paris catacombs.

457
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:57,060
我收回前言
I stand corrected.

458
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,550
你的成功让人鼓舞  艾登
Your success is inspiring, Aiden,

459
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:02,260
你对这座城市的忠诚也是
as well as your loyalty to this city.

460
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,670
而你如此年轻  非常风趣
And the fact that you're young, apparently very funny --

461
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:06,640
我同意
I'm in.

462
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,010
其实在艾伦告诉我你为什么
Actually, I was in as soon as Aaron told me

463
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:10,930
想来和我会面的时候  我就同意了
what you wanted to meet about.

464
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,060
但我很好奇你会如何展开攻势
But I was curious what your attack strategy would be.

465
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:15,530
你觉得如何
So, how was it?

466
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:17,020
非常有效
It was very effective.

467
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,920
加州监狱  囚犯

468
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,060
别担心
Now, don't worry.

469
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:52,060
他已经当了九年的模范囚犯
He's been a model inmate for nine years

470
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:54,770
并在图书馆为其他狱友进行辅导
and tutors the other prisoners in the library.

471
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:09,560
在鹈鹕湾州监狱留长指甲很有用啊
Coke nail come in handy up at Pelican Bay?

472
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,880
我做首饰
I make jewelry.

473
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,900
这样更好挑珠子
Helps me pick up the beads.

474
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,330
你有癌症或肝病家族史吗
Is there a history of cancer or liver disease in your family?

475
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:17,930
我几个月前就回答过了
I went through this a couple of months ago.

476
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:19,530
你有我的档案
You have my file.

477
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:21,020
我们需要做自己的检查
We need to do our own exam.

478
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:23,520
而在先前的档案里没有关于你家人的记录
And there's nothing about your family in previous records.

479
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,790
他们还健在吗
Are they still alive?

480
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:25,900
对我来说他们已经死了
They're dead to me.

481
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:28,530
别废话  不然现在就送你回去
Quit stalling, or we'll send you back right now.

482
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:34,870
我十五岁之后就没和任何家人有联系了
I haven't spoken to anyone in my family since I was 15 years old.

483
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:37,590
我只知道当年我的父母足够健康
Last I know, uh, both my parents were healthy enough

484
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,840
能每天把我虐打得屁滚尿流
to kick the crap out of me on a daily basis.

485
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,380
还有其他问题吗
Any other questions?

486
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,010
你为什么想这么做
Why do you want to do this?

487
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:48,120
也许我只是喜欢可爱的护士和难吃的果冻吧
Maybe I just like, uh, cute nurses and bad Jell-o.

488
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:50,090
-你为什么关心这个  -我们不关心
- Why do you care? - We don't.

489
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,000
只要你乖乖听话照做
As long as you do what you're told.

490
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,160
别担心
Don't worry.

491
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,230
我很擅长遵从命令
I'm very good at following orders.

492
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:08,340
伯恩斯市议员一定对脸部提拉手术非常满意
Councilman Burns must be very happy with his facelift.

493
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,550
他刚又为募捐晚宴付了一桌的钱
He just bought another table for the fundraiser.

494
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:13,520
我尽力讨好  但你早就知道了
I aim to please, but you already knew that.

495
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,640
我需要上手术  别装模做样
And I need to get into surgery, so stop being so coy.

496
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,700
怎么了
What's up?

497
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:21,310
你和伊莎贝尔看上去总是琴瑟和谐
You and Isabel always seem very happy,

498
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:24,040
能工作生活两不误
able to manage both your professional and personal lives.

499
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,210
谢谢你的夸奖  但还是有点装
I'm flattered you think so, but still a bit coy.

500
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:30,220
当我去见艾登·柯尔特商讨致辞的事时
When I met with Aiden Coulter about being our keynote,

501
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,600
我觉得我们之间有火花
I thought there was a spark.

502
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,980
现在开始有意思了
Okay, so now we're getting somewhere.

503
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,920
手术可以等几分钟
Surgery can wait a few minutes.

504
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:40,680
如果我想继续发展是不是不太专业
Is it...unprofessional of me to explore it?

505
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,150
他不是医院员工
He's not a hospital employee,

506
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:44,520
反而可能是个大金主  而且...
but potentially a significant donor and...

507
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,220
更年轻
younger.

508
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:48,270
岁数差的不少
Quite a bit.

509
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,260
我不知道  也许我只是在
I don't know, maybe I'm just

510
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,360
臆想根本不存在的东西
imagining something that doesn't even exist.

511
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,290
我不觉得
I doubt that.

512
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:57,500
你是位迷人  聪颖而有趣的女性
You're an attractive, smart, interesting woman.

513
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,290
我确定当时你们擦出了火花
I'm sure there was a spark.

514
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:02,660
但你不能和像柯尔特这样的捐助人约会
But you can't date a donor like Coulter.

515
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,750
抱歉
Sorry.

516
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,350
没有规定说不行
There's no actual policy against it.

517
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:08,900
我不是说规定  而是别人怎么看
I'm not talking policy, I'm talking optics.

518
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,860
你最不想要的就是有人认为
The last thing you want is someone thinking

519
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:13,530
他的慷慨解囊是一场桃色交易
you'd use sex to get a big donation.

520
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,340
我知道这是双标
It's a double standard, I know,

521
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,560
但这就是现实
but it's the world we live in.

522
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,460
我说了不  我不想要
I said no! I don't want it!

523
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,870
我以为你们已经给他喂药让他安静下来
I thought you gave him something to calm him.

524
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:26,320
没错  但他非常激动
We did, but he's too agitated.

525
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,150
我要开始静脉注射咪达唑仑了
I'm gonna start him on IV midazolam now.

526
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:29,610
埃里克  埃里克
Eric -- Eric,

527
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:31,650
记得先前朴医生说的集中注意力吗
remember what Dr. Park said earlier about focusing?

528
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:33,020
我知道你能行
I know you can do that.

529
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,870
我们给你戴上之前你用的耳机如何
How about we get those earbuds you had earlier?

530
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:35,720
不  别碰我
No! Leave me alone!

531
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,330
埃里克  停下
Eric! Stop it.

532
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:38,240
看着我
Look at me!

533
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,050
别动
Do not move.

534
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:59,790
你的穿着很有型
You wear very stylish clothes.

535
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:01,790
谢谢
Thank you.

536
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:04,160
我猜你是说我不做手术的时候
I assume you mean when I'm not in surgery.

537
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:07,570
对  你觉得别人认为你是个好医生
Yes. Do you think people believe you're a better doctor

538
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:08,770
是因为你的衣着吗
because of that?

539
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:11,220
是有些人这么觉得
Some people.

540
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:13,060
其他人可能只是觉得
Others probably just think

541
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,280
我喜欢炫耀  人很自大或者是基佬
I'm a show-off or arrogant, gay.

542
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,450
我不管  我是为了我自己
I don't care. I do it for myself.

543
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:19,090
自己看起来有模有样就感觉很好
You look good, you feel good.

544
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:21,290
这对你交友有帮助吗
Does it help you make friends?

545
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:25,960
自我感觉良好对一切都有帮助
Feeling good about yourself helps with everything.

546
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:30,670
你知道我能去哪里买有型的燕尾服吗
Do you know where I can buy a stylish tuxedo?

547
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:33,300
我能付两千块
I can pay $2,000.

548
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,370
好吧
Okay.

549
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,430
雷兹尼克医生说
Dr. Reznick says

550
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:38,890
如果我想认识能对我事业有助力的人
if I want people who matter to help my career,

551
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:43,330
我需要在募捐晚宴上穿两千块的燕尾服
I need to wear a tuxedo that costs $2,000 to the fundraiser.

552
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:45,030
你有和格拉斯曼谈过这事吗
Have you talked to Glassman about this?

553
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:48,230
没有  我现在自己做决定了
No. I make my own decisions now.

554
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:53,470
莫菲  别人想帮助你的事业
Murphy, people who matter will help your career

555
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:55,190
是因为他们对你的才能
because they're impressed with your talent

556
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,940
和作为外科医生的潜力印象深刻
and potential as a surgeon.

557
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:58,880
我可以让你去找我的裁缝
And I could send you to my tailor,

558
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,110
你肯定能花到两千块
where you'll definitely spend two grand.

559
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,350
但我建议你租一件就行
But my advice would be just rent one.

560
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:05,000
试合身了
Make sure you get fitted by the manager,

561
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,070
花几百元就搞定了
and for a couple-hundred bucks, you'll be fine.

562
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,740
我需要你从十开始倒数
I'm gonna need you to count backwards from 10.

563
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:24,510
十  九  八...
Ten, nine, eight...

564
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,530
看来你错了
Looks like you were wrong.

565
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:33,640
我说他会使出浑身解数让我们相信他
I said he'll do anything to convince us to trust him,

566
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:35,160
让我们放下防备
to let our guard down.

567
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:40,030
他的眼睛  肿起来了
His eyes, they're swelling up.

568
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:46,260
还有他的舌头  他过敏了
So is his tongue. He's having an allergic reaction.

569
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,470
停止麻醉
Stop the anaesthesia.

570
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,170
肌肉注射0.5毫克的肾上腺素
Give me 0.5 MGs epinephrine I.M. Now.

571
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:50,970
我来
I'm on it.

572
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:54,440
-注射完毕  -他缺氧了
- Epi's in. - He's hypoxic.

573
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,960
我们得给他插管  拿个5.0的管子
We need to intubate. Getting a 5.0 tube.

574
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,700
快
Now!

575
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:16,430
你对麻醉严重过敏
You had a severe allergic reaction to the anaesthesia.

576
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:19,800
我们得给你插管  注射类固醇
We had to intubate you and give you steroids.

577
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,870
你们没有做
You didn't do it?

578
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:26,980
不麻醉的话
We can't operate on you

579
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:28,930
我们没法在你身上动手术
if you can't breathe under anaesthesia.

580
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,330
你做了能做的一切
You did everything you could.

581
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,170
病人的父母希望你知道
The patient's parents wanted you to know

582
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:35,980
他们很感激你所做的一切
they're extremely grateful for everything you did.

583
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:38,160
或是努力去做的一切
Or tried to do.

584
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,200
你们可以再试一次
You can try again.

585
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,670
抱歉  不行
I'm sorry, we can't.

586
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:47,460
不  你们再试一次
No, you try again.

587
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:51,530
好吗  再试试
Okay? Try again?

588
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:53,800
你们再试试
You try again.

589
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:56,510
再试试
Try again!

590
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:57,560
再试试
Try again!

591
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,590
冷静点
Calm down!

592
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:00,670
再试试  再试试
Try again! Try again!

593
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:02,400
听不懂吗  冷静点
He said calm down! Now!

594
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,210
又是这样  又是这样  对吗
Same old, same old, yeah?

595
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:22,440
对我来说总是这样
That's the way it's always been for me.

596
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,900
我从没...
Nothing I ever...

597
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,730
他还排在器官资源共享网络的第一位
He's still on the top of the UNOS list,

598
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:42,080
我们整晚都会一直打电话
and we're gonna be calling and rechecking

599
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,320
复查每个登记表和资料库
every registry and database all night.

600
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,730
我们还有多长时间
How long do we have?

601
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,700
没有新肝脏的话  也许一天
Without a new liver, maybe a day.

602
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:59,540
你买什么  雨果博斯  阿玛尼
So, what'd you get -- Hugo Boss? Armani?

603
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:02,950
安德鲁斯医生说我应该租一套
Dr. Andrews said I should just rent one.

604
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:04,160
你要听他的吗
And you're gonna listen to him?

605
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:08,330
他是外科手术主任  而且他还懂服装
He's the Chief of Surgery. And he knows about clothes.

606
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:10,490
如果安德鲁斯有儿子  你觉得他会让他儿子
If Andrews had a son, you think he'd let him

607
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:12,800
在重要的场合穿着廉价的租赁礼服吗
go to an important event in a cheap rental tux?

608
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:18,510
他说应以天赋来评判他人
He said people who matter judge people based on their talent.

609
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,840
是  他说的是别人家的孩子
Yeah, that's what he tells someone else's kid.

610
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,370
对于他自己  或他真正尊重的人  他会说实话
To his own, or someone he actually respects, he tells the truth.

611
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:26,370
切一下这里
Cut here.

612
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:36,010
你尊重我吗
Do you respect me?

613
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:42,340
你很聪明  能记住很多信息  但是...
You're smart, able to memorize a ton of information, but...

614
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:44,110
不  并不
no, not really.

615
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,530
抽吸纵隔
Suction the mediastinum.

616
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,260
你面对一个自己并不尊重的人
You've certainly put a lot of thought

617
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:58,250
却花了不少心思帮他考虑穿什么去派对
into what someone you claim not to respect wears to a party.

618
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,830
我不尊重他并不代表我不喜欢他
Just because I don't respect him doesn't mean I don't like him.

619
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,100
每个人都觉得穿华丽的衣服不舒服
Everyone's uncomfortable in fancy clothes

620
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,300
讨厌在募捐晚宴上讨好那些权贵
and hates kissing up to bigwigs at a fundraiser.

621
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,750
但是他们会那么做  他们不会畏缩在家
But they do it. They don't cower at home alone.

622
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,780
你用你的自闭症当拐杖
You use your autism as a crutch.

623
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,760
如果你再喜欢他一点  他就该被打成乌眼青了
Okay, I think if you liked him any more, he'd have a black eye.

624
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,910
确保那边已经搞定  主动脉没有缠绕在一起
Make sure we're clear on that side and the aorta isn't kinked.

625
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:26,110
-主动脉没有缠绕在一起  -很好
- The aorta isn't kinked. - Good.

626
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:27,560
关键的时刻到了
Now for the moment of truth.

627
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,520
放进去
Position the plate.

628
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:39,780
很合适
Perfect fit.

629
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:48,890
搞什么
What the hell?

630
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,550
你做了什么
What'd you do?

631
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,240
我什么都感觉不到
I don't feel nothing.

632
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:55,340
不  别碰他
No, don't touch him.

633
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:57,290
如果他控制不了他的膀胱...
If he can't control his bladder...

634
00:27:57,290 --> 00:27:58,890
他可以控制自己
He can control himself just fine.

635
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:01,320
想的挺美  但是假期结束
Nice try, but the vacation's over.

636
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,100
站起来
Stand up.

637
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,540
先再检查一遍他的手铐
Re-check his cuffs first.

638
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,420
你去换衣服  然后我们就走
You're getting changed, and we're going.

639
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:07,910
就这么带他走吧
Just take him like he is.

640
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:09,230
我才不会就这么
I'm not gonna get stuck in the van

641
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:11,520
和他在车里待三个小时
for the next three hours with him like that.

642
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:13,700
小心他的手  小心他的手
Watch his hands! Watch his hands!

643
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:18,230
放下枪
Put the gun down now!

644
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:19,680
你开枪  他死
You shoot me, he dies.

645
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:21,090
谁都不会开枪的
Now, no one is shooting anyone.

646
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,660
大家都保持冷静
Everyone stay calm.

647
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,230
给他空间
Give him space.

648
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:26,000
你做了好事  鲍里斯
You did something good, Boris.

649
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,650
别毁了它
Don't ruin it now.

650
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,840
我什么都没做  不是吗
I did nothing, yeah?

651
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:34,170
我什么都没做成
I accomplished nothing!

652
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:37,540
接下来发生什么完全取决于你
Whatever happens next is completely in your control.

653
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:41,750
你有掌控权  但并不是无限制的
You have power, but it's not unlimited.

654
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,380
你跑不了
You're not gonna escape,

655
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:45,200
你是不可能走出这里的
you're not just walking out of here.

656
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:47,990
但是可以做一些让步
But there are things, concessions,

657
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:49,620
让你的生活更好一些
that could make your life better.

658
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:53,320
所以我们聊聊吧
So let's just take our time and talk.

659
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,230
不着急
There's no rush.

660
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:57,440
你想要什么  鲍里斯
What do you want, Boris?

661
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:01,090
你真正想要什么
What do you really want?

662
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,870
我不想让任何人救我
I don't want anyone to help me.

663
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:08,590
无论你们把那些叫做什么  那些抢救措施
Whatever you call it, these life-saving measures.

664
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:11,090
我  不要
I -- No.

665
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:12,790
不要
No.

666
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:18,350
不要那么做
Do not do it.

667
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:22,200
别听她的  是你的选择
Don't listen to her. It's your choice.

668
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,660
你想怎么做都可以
You do what you want.

669
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:25,320
是啊
Yeah.

670
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,670
鲍里斯  不要
Boris, no!

671
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:40,670
快走  快  快
Let's go! Let's go! Move! Move!

672
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:44,310
梅伦德斯在路上
Melendez is en route.

673
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,740
好了  准备好了吗  走
All right, ready? Let's go.

674
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,280
三  二  一
Three, two, one.

675
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,550
立刻呼叫泌尿外科和心胸外科
Page urology and cardio-thoracic stat.

676
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,620
他死了  他签署了器官捐献志愿书
He's dead and he has a donor card.

677
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,450
我们要取走他所有能捐献的东西
We're gonna take everything he can donate.

678
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:12,730
年度盛典

679
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:10,240
BGM: Everyday by Nvdes

680
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:10,240
? Our love was hard to maintain, so we broke it ?

681
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:19,990
? But your smile reminds me that I cannot lose all of you ?

682
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:23,150
? So can we can we laugh about being crazy? ?

683
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,370
感谢你
Thank you so much.

684
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:27,990
你的致辞很完美
Your speech was perfect.

685
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:28,920
而且很幽默
And hilarious.

686
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,490
太客气了
You're very welcome.

687
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:33,150
我很感谢有这个机会可以改变我的名声
And I appreciate the opportunity to help change my rep.

688
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:34,370
你还有名声
You have a rep?

689
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:36,820
工作狂  不玩乐
All work and no play.

690
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,570
我现在正努力作出改变
Something I'm working on changing.

691
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:41,830
你的名声还是生活方式
Your rep or your lifestyle?

692
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:44,080
我得减小压力  获得更多乐趣
I need less stress and more fun.

693
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,210
你想哪天一起去打高尔夫吗
Would you like to play golf sometime?

694
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:56,300
在真正的球场上打
On a real course with actual grass.

695
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,730
当然
Absolutely.

696
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,330
想跳舞吗
Would you like to dance?

697
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,010
乐意之至
I'd love to.

698
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,400
好了  走吧
All right, let's go.

699
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:08,490
? Like it's true ?

700
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:11,520
? So can we laugh about being crazy? ?

701
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,630
我们得立刻给埃里克做好准备
We need to get Eric prepped right away.

702
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:17,400
发生什么了  你们找到新的肝脏捐赠者了吗
What's happening? Did you find a new liver donor?

703
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:19,740
实际上  还是同一个人
Actually, it's -- it's the same one.

704
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,730
情况有变
The circumstances have changed.

705
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:24,870
真令人难以置信
This is incredible.

706
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:26,600
不  我不想要
No, I don't want it.

707
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:30,750
埃里克  当捐赠者发现
Eric, when the donor found out

708
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:33,580
他不能做手术帮助你
that he couldn't do the surgery to help you,

709
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:36,020
他特别伤心
he became incredibly sad

710
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:41,730
因为他更想你活着
because he wanted you to live more than he wanted to live.

711
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:48,180
他结束了自己的生命  为了让你可以移植肝脏
He ended his life so that you could have his liver.

712
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:52,960
他知道自己做过一些坏事
He -- He knew he'd done some bad things,

713
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:58,810
我想这是他认为的唯一的弥补方法
and I think that this was the only way he knew how to make amends.

714
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,550
我觉得我们应该努力帮帮他
I think we should try and help him.

715
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,040
你觉得你可以那么做吗...
Do you think you can do that --

716
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,760
帮助他人  做好事
help someone do something good?

717
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:20,660
好吧
Yeah.

718
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:25,630
一切都很不错的样子
Everything looks good good.

719
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,360
记得深呼吸
Remember to take deep breaths

720
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,820
这样你就不会有肺部的并发症
so you don't develop any lung complications,

721
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:33,030
当然  还有在接下来的几周
and, obviously, avoid lifting anything too heavy

722
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:34,540
要避免提重物
for the next few weeks.

723
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,000
我...
I...

724
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:39,280
怎么了  宝贝
What, honey?

725
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:42,070
我想抱抱
I want a hug.

726
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:10,210
BGM: Smooth Sailin' by Leon Bridges

727
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:11,390
? Over the horizon, she's smooth sailin' ?

728
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:14,180
? These concrete seas ?

729
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:17,650
? Now she's headed ?

730
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:17,960
你看起来像个百万富翁
You look like a million bucks.

731
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:23,200
不  这身2368元
No, it cost $2,368.

732
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,200
很值
Well, it was worth every penny.

733
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,780
很好的投资
Good investment.

734
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,460
很高兴看到你犒劳你自己了
Glad to see you're treating yourself.

735
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,420
这是你应得的
You deserve it.

736
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:31,930
你的裙子多少钱
How much did you dress cost?

737
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,410
我不记得了
I don't remember.

738
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:39,020
你知道吗  这种晚宴上
And just so you know, that's not the best question

739
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,470
不适合提这种问题
for an event like this.

740
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:42,510
为什么
Why not?

741
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:46,630
不知道  就是不太行
I don't know. It just isn't.

742
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:48,590
好吧
Okay.

743
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:51,910
我能请你喝一杯吗
Can I buy you a drink?

744
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:53,780
我再也不喜欢龙舌兰了
I don't like tequila anymore.

745
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:55,310
喝了就想吐
It makes me vomit.

746
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:58,100
好吧  这里也有别的酒
Well, okay. They have other choices.

747
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,660
来杯葡萄酒或苏打水吗
A glass of wine or a soda?

748
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:01,710
不要  谢谢
No, thank you.

749
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:06,350
那边有个律所合伙人
that's a partner at a firm

750
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:08,360
上个月帮我们做过一些志愿法律服务
that did some pro bono work for us last month,

751
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,690
我得去感谢他一下
so I have to go thank him.

752
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:12,640
好  再见
Okay. Bye.

753
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,520
? I won't wear you down ?

754
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,520
? No, honey, I won't ?

755
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,900
? Wear you down ?

756
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:21,700
? She's smooth ?

757
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:20,520
你好
Hello.

758
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:22,670
你好
Hello.

759
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,970
? Smooth sailin' ?

760
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:26,180
? Smooth sailin' ?

761
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:29,670
? She's smooth ?

762
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:33,440
? Smooooth, darling ?

763
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,190
你在这里啊
There you are.

764
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:38,240
打扮得不错
And nicely done.

765
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,110
有了这身打扮
You got the look.

766
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:41,640
就一定要好好利用
Now you got to put it to use.

767
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:42,930
你还有任务呢
There's work to do.

768
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:44,210
跟人交流
Mingle.

769
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:46,340
好的
Okay.

770
00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:50,220
我看到你了  陈医生
I see you, Dr. Chen.

771
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:53,450
她是梅奥医学中心的利文顿协会负责人
She runs the Rivington Fellowship at the Mayo Clinic.

772
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,540
不知道谁把她带来的
I wonder who brought her here.

773
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:57,350
我不知道
I don't know.

774
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:00,560
交流
Mingle.

775
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,330
你还是觉得人是无法改变的吗
You still think people can't change?

776
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,790
反正他没变
He didn't.

777
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:11,930
他就是一个为财害命的凶手
He's an assassin who murdered people for money.

778
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:15,070
今天只不过是又一次的冷血谋杀
Today was just one more cold-blooded killing.

779
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:17,250
你帮助他牺牲了自己的生命
You helped him sacrifice his life

780
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:19,370
从而让他可以去救其他人
so that he could save someone else.

781
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:22,140
我并不赞成你的做法
I am not a fan of what you did,

782
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:24,820
即便这证明了...
even if it did prove --

783
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:26,610
他并没有什么牺牲
He didn't sacrifice anything.

784
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:28,300
他死了很久了
He died a long time ago.

785
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:29,940
他的帮派早就散了
His crew is probably gone.

786
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:33,300
在监狱里  他什么都不是
In prison, he was a nobody.

787
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,990
现在呢  他像个英雄一样
And now? He lives on as a hero

788
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,750
对埃里克的家人  媒体和你而言皆是如此
to Eric's family, to the press, to you.

789
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:52,080
黄疸病情有所好转
Jaundice is improving.

790
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:53,860
水肿也在消散
Edema's resolving, too.

791
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:55,480
各项体征都还不错
His vitals look good.

792
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,060
今晚挺成功的
It's been great night.

793
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,440
有另外三个人的生命也得到了拯救
Three other lives were saved, as well.

794
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,280
他父母知道他做的事吗
Does his parents know what he did?

795
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,020
我想送他们一张卡片
I want to send them a card.

796
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,330
我知道他们可能会很伤心  但是...
I know they're gonna be sad, but...

797
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:16,000
我想告诉他们  我会好好照顾他们儿子的肝脏
I want to tell them I'll take good care of their son's liver.

798
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:21,560
我觉得这个想法非常好
I think that's a great idea.

799
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:41,300
真是不错
This is impressive.

800
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:50,660
BGM: Good Time by Earl St. Clair

801
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:44,900
有点像高中舞会  不过大家没长青春痘
It's kind of like prom, but without the acne.

802
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:49,540
还有一个上周播放过「米高梅大酒店」的DJ
And with a DJ that played the MGM Grand last week.

803
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:51,160
能有幸请你跳支舞吗
Would you do me the honor?

804
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:51,860
? On the floor ?

805
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:54,730
? I bet you think you look cool ?

806
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:55,690
真有型
Classy.

807
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:57,490
我现在处于最佳状态而已
I brought my A-game.

808
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:59,140
? They don't play no more slow cuts ?

809
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:01,280
? Everything is turned up ?

810
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:03,850
? I bet you think you look cool ?

811
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:05,450
? Look cool ?

812
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:08,290
? I'm not the one to rain on parades ?

813
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:10,630
? But you in the club in some shades ?

814
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:13,290
? What is goin' on now, a day ?

815
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,640
? Now a day ?

816
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:17,680
? This is why I stay in the house ?

817
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,570
? I'm better off parked on the couch ?

818
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:30,650
-拍个照吧  -你真漂亮
- Take a picture. - Ooh, you look great!

819
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,720
? When I go out, go out ?

820
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:42,420
? Put on my Sunday best and show out (Show out) ?

821
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:47,040
? I just wanna have a good time (Good time, good time) ?

822
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:51,880
? I just wanna have a good time (Good time, good time) ?

823
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,590
? I just wanna have a good time ?

824
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:55,760
? Oh, yeah ?

825
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,850
? I just wanna have a good time ?

826
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:02,280
? I just wanna have a good time ?

827
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:04,040
刚开始这会儿最难熬
The first little while is the hardest,

828
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:06,000
之后就能进行下一步了
and then you move on.

829
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,230
你就从不这样
You never did.

830
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:08,820
这倒是真的
Well, that's true.

831
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:11,180
但这并不意味着你也不用
Doesn't mean you don't have to.

832
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,100
也许吧
Maybe.

833
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,650
谢谢
Thank you.

834
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:18,390
你要怎么做  枯坐着自怨自艾吗
Well, what are you gonna do? Are you gonna sit around and mope?

至少试一下嘛
At least try.

836
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:22,620
我要怎么做
How do I do that?

837
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:24,500
我不知道
I don't know. ?

838
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,730
如果我知道我自己早就做了
If I knew, I would have done it.

839
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:28,470
我们跳舞吧

好吧  这样挺好的

845
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:51,770
草莓香芒  是唇彩的味道

我们可以一起逛商场
We can go together!

848
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,730
就这么说定了
It's a plan!

849
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:56,640
我们都去
Let's all go!

850
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,640
话说  我们自拍一个吧
You know what, let's take a selfie.

851
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,250
-好  -好

大家都过来  靠近一点

我应该记得吗
Should I?

864

你真的不记得了
You really don't remember?

865

不记得
No.

866
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,120
怎么了
What's wrong?

867
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:45,460
这是我们第一次在医院值夜班时放的歌
It's the song that played during our first overnight at the hospital.

868
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:47,670
? I wanna touch you, but I'm too late ?

869
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,400
我们伴着这首歌第一次接吻

871
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:57,510
抱歉  今天真是太累了
I'm sorry. It's been a long day.

872
00:39:58,620 --> 00:39:59,450
是啊
Yeah.

873
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,570
杰瑞德  这并不能说明什么
Jared, it doesn't mean anything.

874
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:05,260
不  这很有什么
Yeah, it does.

我爱你  克莱尔
I love you, Claire.

877
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:14,220
你却从未爱过我
You never loved me.

878
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,960
我本以为总有一天你会有所改变  但...
Now, I thought that maybe someday that would change, but...

879
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:21,370
实际上并不会
it won't.

880
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:25,250
? But I know I'm out of my mind ?

881
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:29,050
再见  克莱尔
Bye, Claire.

882
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:31,280
? There's a love between us still ?

883
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:35,660
? But something's changed, and I don't know why ?

884
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:39,610
? Never felt so close, but now I know it's over ?

885
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:42,200
? And all I wanna do is go home with you ?

886
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:52,600

00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:57,780

890
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:59,820

893
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:05,060
? Surround me ?

894
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:08,330
但是没有一个人知道怎么写...
not one of them has a clue how to write an --

895

很显然  我错了
Apparently I was wrong.

903
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:34,830
我告诉莫菲医生最好租个燕尾服
I told Dr. Murphy he'd be fine renting a tuxedo.

904
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,080
显然他没听我的话
Clearly, he chose not to listen.

905
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:39,400
-对不起  -不用  你看起来很帅
