1
00:00:00,633 --> 00:00:02,887
You're a lot of fun.
We should do this again.

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:05,624
My niece is coming by.
Keep your distance.

3
00:00:05,667 --> 00:00:07,278
This is Tracy.

4
00:00:07,321 --> 00:00:09,661
- Nice to meet you.
- Same.

5
00:00:09,705 --> 00:00:11,543
Come help me convert the
laundry room into my office.

6
00:00:11,586 --> 00:00:13,284
- You're asking for my help.
- Yeah.

7
00:00:13,327 --> 00:00:15,634
But you didn't ask. You gave an order.

8
00:00:15,677 --> 00:00:18,115
For some reason, Boden loves this guy.

9
00:00:18,158 --> 00:00:21,030
So I got to do my best to make it work.

10
00:00:21,074 --> 00:00:22,641
You are my life.

11
00:00:22,684 --> 00:00:25,581
I wouldn't change a second of that.

12
00:00:26,601 --> 00:00:28,864
Watch your step!

13
00:00:28,908 --> 00:00:30,301
Get out, get out, get out!

14
00:00:30,344 --> 00:00:32,172
Please, God, please!

15
00:00:32,216 --> 00:00:35,049
- Let them work.
- I can save him. Please.

16
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,309
No, no, no, no, no.

17
00:00:49,842 --> 00:00:51,844
Okay.

18
00:01:32,972 --> 00:01:34,843
Mateo's party's at that bouncy place,

19
00:01:34,887 --> 00:01:37,237
and it's right after
the bug play at school,

20
00:01:37,281 --> 00:01:39,239
so maybe you can come?

21
00:01:39,283 --> 00:01:43,156
Uh, sounds like fun.
When is the bug play?

22
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,811
I told you, Friday.

23
00:01:45,854 --> 00:01:50,685
You know, that's a busy day
for me at work.

24
00:01:50,935 --> 00:01:54,112
But I promise you, I will try.

25
00:01:57,849 --> 00:02:00,097
I heard Mom on the phone.

26
00:02:00,122 --> 00:02:01,820
She said a chief died.

27
00:02:03,611 --> 00:02:08,254
Yeah, sadly, that's true.

28
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:12,751
He was a good man.

29
00:02:12,794 --> 00:02:14,318
You're a chief.

30
00:02:20,237 --> 00:02:21,764
Look at me.

31
00:02:22,444 --> 00:02:24,850
I am safe and sound.

32
00:02:29,158 --> 00:02:30,647
You know what?

33
00:02:32,292 --> 00:02:34,652
I'm gonna make it to that bug play.

34
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:36,296
Don't you worry.

35
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:39,473
Okay.

36
00:02:41,693 --> 00:02:42,911
Bye.

37
00:02:44,913 --> 00:02:46,266
I love you.

38
00:02:56,229 --> 00:02:57,970
Hey.

39
00:02:58,013 --> 00:02:59,537
Thought first shift was
supposed to stay out of there.

40
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:03,758
Oh, uh, I'm Jonah,
the floater for second shift.

41
00:03:03,802 --> 00:03:05,282
New medic.

42
00:03:05,325 --> 00:03:09,019
Just doing my thing and
checking it all out, you know?

43
00:03:10,417 --> 00:03:14,632
So, uh, how's House 51?

44
00:03:14,676 --> 00:03:17,946
You hear things, you know,
like you guys are legendary,

45
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:20,209
or something?

46
00:03:20,253 --> 00:03:23,283
To be honest, I'm still trying
to figure it all out myself.

47
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:25,577
Good luck.

48
00:03:26,215 --> 00:03:28,435
Talk more later.

49
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:30,829
- Hi.
- Hey.

50
00:03:30,872 --> 00:03:32,004
Mm.

51
00:03:32,047 --> 00:03:33,484
Is the floater as bad as you thought?

52
00:03:33,527 --> 00:03:35,176
Ugh, worse.

53
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:36,965
He's obsessed with manga, which,

54
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:38,489
I have no idea what that even is,

55
00:03:38,532 --> 00:03:40,969
but he's informed me
that Rengoku's death

56
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:43,798
in "Demon Slayer: Mugen Train"
had to happen

57
00:03:43,842 --> 00:03:46,018
for the plot of the
"Demon Slayer" series to work,

58
00:03:46,061 --> 00:03:48,455
and he's pretty worked up about it.

59
00:03:48,499 --> 00:03:50,022
- Oh, God.
- Yeah.

60
00:03:50,065 --> 00:03:52,329
I am not leaving the locker
room until the bells go off.

61
00:03:54,374 --> 00:03:55,897
Have you heard from Violet?

62
00:03:55,941 --> 00:03:59,074
Just a thank you text for my
messages after the funeral...

63
00:03:59,118 --> 00:04:01,033
very brief.

64
00:04:01,076 --> 00:04:02,164
You?

65
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:03,383
Same.

66
00:04:03,427 --> 00:04:05,559
The funeral was heartbreaking.

67
00:04:05,603 --> 00:04:09,084
That speech Evan's big brother
gave almost killed me.

68
00:04:09,128 --> 00:04:10,825
I wish there was more
we could do for her.

69
00:04:10,869 --> 00:04:12,174
I know.

70
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:14,133
I did have a thought
about a couple things

71
00:04:14,176 --> 00:04:15,793
we could send to her place,

72
00:04:15,817 --> 00:04:18,050
- maybe cheer her up a little.
- Yeah, I like the sound of that.

73
00:04:18,093 --> 00:04:20,357
Ambulance 61, Squad 3,

74
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,235
person trapped, Oakwood Beach.

75
00:04:52,737 --> 00:04:54,826
He says his son was playing in the pile,

76
00:04:54,869 --> 00:04:56,697
digging a big hole,
and the sides collapsed...

77
00:04:56,741 --> 00:04:58,569
a little eight-year-old boy.

78
00:05:03,225 --> 00:05:05,271
Hey, we can't use tools.

79
00:05:05,314 --> 00:05:06,446
Move aside.

80
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:07,948
Nico, hang in there, buddy.

81
00:05:15,062 --> 00:05:19,914

82
00:05:25,883 --> 00:05:30,279
Backboards, ground pads,
forms and shovels... let's go.

83
00:05:30,322 --> 00:05:32,934
Yeah, copy that, Lieutenant.

84
00:05:32,977 --> 00:05:34,239
- How deep was he?
- I don't know.

85
00:05:34,283 --> 00:05:37,634
Like 3, maybe, 4 feet.

86
00:05:37,678 --> 00:05:38,635
Chief?

87
00:05:38,679 --> 00:05:41,464
Box him in, right here.

88
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:43,335
Hey, I'm gonna need you
to wait down there.

89
00:05:44,859 --> 00:05:46,513
Off the pile.

90
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:56,435
All right, squad, drive them
in as deep as you can.

91
00:05:59,874 --> 00:06:01,251
Let's move, guys.

92
00:06:08,186 --> 00:06:10,537
- Got him!
- Nico!

93
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,975
It's just his hand so far. Stand by.

94
00:06:12,019 --> 00:06:14,323
Get this sand out of here!

95
00:06:17,935 --> 00:06:20,677
I got his head. I got his head.

96
00:06:20,721 --> 00:06:22,070
Uncovering his head now.

97
00:06:22,113 --> 00:06:24,376
Here, bring the oxygen tank up to him.

98
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,642
Cruz, can you get that mask on him?

99
00:06:25,686 --> 00:06:27,205
Yeah, you got it.

100
00:06:27,249 --> 00:06:28,789
It's all right.

101
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:30,999
Is he breathing?

102
00:06:35,431 --> 00:06:36,998
Is he breathing?

103
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:38,608
Look, they have to get all
that heavy sand off his chest

104
00:06:38,652 --> 00:06:40,567
before they get him breathing, okay?

105
00:06:44,701 --> 00:06:46,747
- How long was he under there?
- I don't know.

106
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:49,893
Uh, maybe seven minutes.

107
00:06:54,624 --> 00:06:55,799
Breathe.

108
00:06:59,498 --> 00:07:01,063
Breathe.

109
00:07:06,897 --> 00:07:08,333
Breathe.

110
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,816
- Cruz, go and take over!
- Captain!

111
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,383
Hey... hey, sir!

112
00:07:14,426 --> 00:07:15,427
We'll bring him to you, okay?

113
00:07:15,471 --> 00:07:16,682
Just give us a minute.

114
00:07:16,725 --> 00:07:19,214
Nico, I'm here, buddy.

115
00:07:19,257 --> 00:07:20,607
Nico!

116
00:07:24,262 --> 00:07:26,134
Chief?

117
00:07:26,177 --> 00:07:28,136
Chief... Chief, come on.

118
00:07:28,179 --> 00:07:30,399
Come on, take a break.

119
00:07:30,442 --> 00:07:31,574
You did good.

120
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:40,986
Got him.

121
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:43,734
Nico?

122
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,426
One, two, three.

123
00:08:24,308 --> 00:08:26,006
- What's that?
- See for yourself.

124
00:08:26,049 --> 00:08:27,703
It just showed up at Molly's.

125
00:08:29,836 --> 00:08:33,274
The estate trust of Spiro Stephanides.

126
00:08:33,317 --> 00:08:35,276
That the crazy old dude
who used to own the bar?

127
00:08:35,319 --> 00:08:37,390
Yeah, I guess he wasn't lying
when he said he was on his way out.

128
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:41,108
Or when he hinted that
we'd be named in the will.

129
00:08:57,689 --> 00:08:59,082
A beer mug?

130
00:08:59,126 --> 00:09:03,130
Technically a stein, but yeah.

131
00:09:03,173 --> 00:09:04,348
That's it.

132
00:09:04,392 --> 00:09:06,133
That's the extent of our bequeathal...

133
00:09:06,176 --> 00:09:09,832
a piece of bric-a-brac,
a Bavarian gewgaw.

134
00:09:09,876 --> 00:09:11,225
Hey, could have been worse.

135
00:09:11,268 --> 00:09:14,371
I was half expecting a monkey's paw.

136
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:17,753
What a crazy old coot he was.

137
00:09:19,189 --> 00:09:20,669
Oh, gross.

138
00:09:20,712 --> 00:09:23,628
I wouldn't drink out of this
for, like, 1,000 bucks.

139
00:09:23,672 --> 00:09:28,024
Well, Donnelly just spent an
hour explaining how

140
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:31,114
Muichiro is the strongest Hashira.

141
00:09:31,158 --> 00:09:32,768
Oh, come on, he's messing with you.

142
00:09:32,811 --> 00:09:34,639
Muichiro is just the Mist Hashira.

143
00:09:34,683 --> 00:09:36,201
I don't get it.

144
00:09:37,033 --> 00:09:38,687
Any word on when Violet's back?

145
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:39,993
I sent her a couple of texts today

146
00:09:40,036 --> 00:09:41,864
just so she knows I'm thinking of her.

147
00:09:41,908 --> 00:09:43,170
Yeah, I sent her
a bunch of messages too.

148
00:09:43,213 --> 00:09:44,823
She hasn't gotten back to me.

149
00:09:44,867 --> 00:09:47,665
Me and Cindy, we packed up some dinners.

150
00:09:47,709 --> 00:09:49,741
We left it with the super
of her building

151
00:09:49,785 --> 00:09:51,265
since she didn't answer the door.

152
00:09:51,308 --> 00:09:53,180
I'm sure she appreciates it all,

153
00:09:53,223 --> 00:09:55,225
but she just needs
some solo time right now...

154
00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:57,967
not feeling up for visits
or coming back to work yet.

155
00:09:58,011 --> 00:10:01,144
But last I heard, she's gonna
get a good long furlough.

156
00:10:11,981 --> 00:10:13,447
Hey, Chief,

157
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:15,348
you want me to finish hosing
all that down for you?

158
00:10:16,255 --> 00:10:18,213
I'm almost done. Thanks.

159
00:10:19,423 --> 00:10:20,859
You were, uh...

160
00:10:20,903 --> 00:10:24,037
you were half man, half machine
out there on that beach, Chief.

161
00:10:24,307 --> 00:10:26,004
It was pretty incredible.

162
00:10:27,796 --> 00:10:29,406
Had to get that boy out.

163
00:10:32,915 --> 00:10:34,482
No other option.

164
00:10:37,702 --> 00:10:39,247
Well, you did.

165
00:10:44,883 --> 00:10:46,254
We did.

166
00:10:47,255 --> 00:10:48,975
Great team effort.

167
00:11:14,167 --> 00:11:16,711
_

168
00:11:16,735 --> 00:11:18,064
_

169
00:11:31,007 --> 00:11:34,107
Carver, got a little job for you.

170
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,306
Great.

171
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:38,241
It's time to repaint
the compartment interiors.

172
00:11:38,492 --> 00:11:39,710
Okay.

173
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:46,336
You still got 12 hours
till the end of shift.

174
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,817
12 hours to tackle what, 20 compartments

175
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:51,385
that I have to empty out, paint, repack.

176
00:11:51,428 --> 00:11:53,613
Well, you scrub first, then paint.

177
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:55,476
And Gallo can't pitch in because...

178
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,521
Because, Carver, it is your turn.

179
00:12:01,308 --> 00:12:02,918
Lieutenant, am I being
punished for something?

180
00:12:02,961 --> 00:12:04,615
No.

181
00:12:04,659 --> 00:12:07,357
But once you are finished, you will know

182
00:12:07,401 --> 00:12:09,629
how the truck is organized,
forwards and backwards.

183
00:12:10,795 --> 00:12:11,927
Great.

184
00:12:36,343 --> 00:12:38,388
It's outside visiting hours, hon.

185
00:12:38,432 --> 00:12:39,911
Oh, uh, I know.

186
00:12:39,955 --> 00:12:41,565
- I'm a medic.
- Ah.

187
00:12:43,698 --> 00:12:46,962
Are you a relative of Gabriel Hammond's?

188
00:12:47,005 --> 00:12:49,225
Uh, no. No.

189
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:52,924
My... my boyfriend, Evan, was a...
was a paramedic chief.

190
00:12:52,968 --> 00:12:54,796
And he tried to save Gabriel.

191
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:58,060
He sheltered him when the
building collapsed, but...

192
00:12:58,104 --> 00:13:01,014
Um, Evan didn't make it out, so.

193
00:13:02,108 --> 00:13:04,309
Very sorry to hear that.

194
00:13:04,719 --> 00:13:08,157
So I've been, um, visiting
him during the off hours

195
00:13:08,201 --> 00:13:10,315
pretty much every day
since Gabriel came in.

196
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:18,080
The neurological exams
just haven't changed

197
00:13:18,124 --> 00:13:19,473
since he got here.

198
00:13:19,516 --> 00:13:20,822
I know.

199
00:13:20,865 --> 00:13:22,650
And I know the doctors
say he may not make it,

200
00:13:22,693 --> 00:13:26,331
but I don't believe that.

201
00:13:26,697 --> 00:13:28,699
He has to pull through.

202
00:13:28,743 --> 00:13:30,168
Has to.

203
00:13:31,006 --> 00:13:32,504
Otherwise...

204
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:35,090
what did Evan die for?

205
00:13:43,077 --> 00:13:45,079
Hey, look at that,

206
00:13:45,209 --> 00:13:46,776
second shift repainting
the compartments.

207
00:13:46,801 --> 00:13:48,349
One side, anyway.

208
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:51,008
I'll have to hit
the other side next shift.

209
00:13:51,051 --> 00:13:53,314
Unless you guys want to take care of it.

210
00:13:53,358 --> 00:13:54,490
What do you say, Jacobs?

211
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:56,774
I say, no thanks.

212
00:13:57,362 --> 00:13:58,972
Can't say I blame you.

213
00:13:59,016 --> 00:14:00,626
How's all that going?

214
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:01,801
Just fine.

215
00:14:01,845 --> 00:14:03,542
If you need a hand next shift...

216
00:14:03,586 --> 00:14:06,110
Thanks, but Lieutenant was pretty clear

217
00:14:06,153 --> 00:14:08,416
she doesn't want you helping.

218
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,244
What's her deal anyway?

219
00:14:10,288 --> 00:14:11,497
How do you mean?

220
00:14:12,377 --> 00:14:14,553
I just get the feeling she's
riding my ass for no reason,

221
00:14:14,597 --> 00:14:17,600
and I'm wondering if it's
the kind of thing she does

222
00:14:17,643 --> 00:14:19,950
a lot, a power play, you know?

223
00:14:19,993 --> 00:14:22,300
If she's making you do
something, there's a reason.

224
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,043
What's the story with her and Severide?

225
00:14:26,086 --> 00:14:28,012
They've been together a long time?

226
00:14:28,056 --> 00:14:29,481
Yeah.

227
00:14:29,525 --> 00:14:30,892
Why?

228
00:14:31,289 --> 00:14:32,495
Just curious.

229
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,706
Kidd's as good a lieutenant
as you'll find anywhere.

230
00:14:39,752 --> 00:14:41,406
See you next shift, Carver.

231
00:14:52,243 --> 00:14:53,723
Everything okay with your son?

232
00:14:53,766 --> 00:14:54,898
Oh, yes.

233
00:14:54,941 --> 00:14:57,248
Yeah, Nico's doing great.

234
00:14:57,291 --> 00:15:00,425
Already back home all because of you.

235
00:15:00,468 --> 00:15:01,756
Yeah.

236
00:15:02,383 --> 00:15:03,863
Rob Scanlon.

237
00:15:03,907 --> 00:15:05,299
Chief Wallace Boden.

238
00:15:05,343 --> 00:15:07,595
It's an honor to shake
your hand, Chief Boden.

239
00:15:08,433 --> 00:15:12,698
Man, uh, the words thank you
just don't seem like enough

240
00:15:12,742 --> 00:15:14,613
for saving my boy's life.

241
00:15:14,657 --> 00:15:16,659
I'm just glad he's okay.

242
00:15:16,702 --> 00:15:18,008
I have a boy about the same age.

243
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:20,097
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

244
00:15:24,928 --> 00:15:28,061
I tried to dig, you know,
to get him out.

245
00:15:28,105 --> 00:15:30,890
And, uh, I was going as hard as I could.

246
00:15:30,934 --> 00:15:32,413
But the more I dug,
it looked like the deeper

247
00:15:32,457 --> 00:15:34,038
I was burying him.

248
00:15:35,242 --> 00:15:39,085
You did the right thing
letting us take over.

249
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:41,118
It's what we train for.

250
00:15:42,902 --> 00:15:45,949
I just felt so helpless.

251
00:15:47,777 --> 00:15:50,209
Worst feeling in the world when
it comes to your kids, right?

252
00:15:50,252 --> 00:15:51,737
Yes, it is.

253
00:15:51,781 --> 00:15:53,304
I've been feeling it a lot lately too.

254
00:15:53,347 --> 00:15:55,175
You know, I moved Nico to Chicago

255
00:15:55,219 --> 00:15:57,351
right when COVID hit the fan
for a new job.

256
00:15:57,395 --> 00:16:00,180
He was online for school
for two years...

257
00:16:00,224 --> 00:16:01,617
no real way to make friends.

258
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,619
So, you know, he's...

259
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:05,236
he's been lonely.

260
00:16:05,751 --> 00:16:07,927
And I try to spend as much time
as I can with him,

261
00:16:07,971 --> 00:16:11,801
but, you know, the job
just has me running.

262
00:16:13,498 --> 00:16:16,457
The beach day was our
first outing in a while.

263
00:16:16,501 --> 00:16:17,458
Believe that?

264
00:16:17,502 --> 00:16:18,895
I'm sorry.

265
00:16:18,938 --> 00:16:21,294
I understand what it is
that you're going through.

266
00:16:21,724 --> 00:16:24,204
Sometimes it seems impossible
to balance it all.

267
00:16:25,815 --> 00:16:27,207
Very true.

268
00:16:29,253 --> 00:16:33,779
Well, hmm, here I am taking up
even more of your time.

269
00:16:33,823 --> 00:16:35,041
No.

270
00:16:35,085 --> 00:16:36,477
I'll let you get back to it.

271
00:16:36,521 --> 00:16:39,061
But, uh, again,

272
00:16:40,743 --> 00:16:42,023
thank you, Chief.

273
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:12,553
Can I come in?

274
00:17:13,514 --> 00:17:18,345
I'm really bad company right now, but...

275
00:17:33,665 --> 00:17:37,495
Let me guess, Stella is stuck
working at Molly's,

276
00:17:37,538 --> 00:17:40,106
so she sent you to bring me a beer,
and try to cheer me up?

277
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:42,892
No. This is my idea.

278
00:17:44,545 --> 00:17:47,296
I wanted to tell you
about a girlfriend I had

279
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:50,091
before your time at 51, Anna.

280
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:54,395
Yeah.

281
00:17:54,566 --> 00:17:56,350
Stella has told me about her.

282
00:17:56,514 --> 00:17:59,865
I mean, I don't know much, but I...

283
00:17:59,909 --> 00:18:01,727
I know she died.

284
00:18:04,696 --> 00:18:08,221
The two toughest things
I've ever been through

285
00:18:08,265 --> 00:18:11,137
were losing Shay and losing her.

286
00:18:15,881 --> 00:18:17,785
And for the longest time

287
00:18:19,406 --> 00:18:23,082
after Anna died, I felt like

288
00:18:24,281 --> 00:18:26,500
a boat cut loose from the dock,

289
00:18:26,544 --> 00:18:30,113
just lost, nothing to hold on to.

290
00:18:31,636 --> 00:18:33,072
Yeah, that's...

291
00:18:33,116 --> 00:18:35,428
yeah, that's pretty much exactly it.

292
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,127
I don't like to think about
how low a bottom

293
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:47,086
I might have hit
if I hadn't gone back to work.

294
00:18:48,784 --> 00:18:52,445
That's just my take,
having been where you are.

295
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:56,400
I appreciate it, I really do.

296
00:18:56,443 --> 00:18:58,075
But the...

297
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:01,187
the difference is...

298
00:19:03,624 --> 00:19:06,105
I'm scared if I go back to work,

299
00:19:06,149 --> 00:19:08,404
I'll see Evan everywhere.

300
00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:10,153
It was his work too.

301
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,260
You can't avoid it that way,
I'm sorry to say.

302
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:22,224
I saw Anna wherever I went,
too, for the longest time.

303
00:19:23,427 --> 00:19:27,257
But what I saw even clearer,
right in front of me,

304
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,477
was my crew at 51,

305
00:19:30,521 --> 00:19:33,306
always bugging me, checking in on me.

306
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:37,907
And I wanted to kill them half the time.

307
00:19:39,356 --> 00:19:44,080
But I knew that if I started to drift,

308
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:47,190
they'd hold on tight.

309
00:19:55,938 --> 00:19:58,941
I mean, I guess it's better
than that old dog mug

310
00:19:58,984 --> 00:20:00,159
we used to have.

311
00:20:00,203 --> 00:20:01,857
Man, that thing bummed me out.

312
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,772
I figured Stephanides
didn't leave us this stein

313
00:20:04,816 --> 00:20:07,297
so we could shove it
in the back of the cabinet.

314
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,995
We gotta honor
a dying man's wishes, right?

315
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:12,171
- Uh, guys?
- Yeah?

316
00:20:12,215 --> 00:20:13,433
Listen, I've been doing
a little digging,

317
00:20:13,477 --> 00:20:16,175
and that stein is, like,
a collector's item.

318
00:20:16,219 --> 00:20:17,829
- Get out.
- No. For real.

319
00:20:17,873 --> 00:20:19,265
These things are all over eBay.

320
00:20:19,309 --> 00:20:22,703
And I think I found one
that looks pretty similar.

321
00:20:22,747 --> 00:20:24,880
It dates back to 1892.

322
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:26,185
No way.

323
00:20:26,229 --> 00:20:27,708
"Depicting the ancient Germanic myth

324
00:20:27,752 --> 00:20:29,188
of Brunhilda and Sigurd."

325
00:20:29,232 --> 00:20:31,147
Ooh, good to know.

326
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:35,151
Herrmann, it sold for almost $9,000.

327
00:20:35,194 --> 00:20:36,630
- What?
- Whoa.

328
00:20:38,981 --> 00:20:42,513
Oh, hey, Ritter,

329
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:45,335
how fast do you think that you could get

330
00:20:45,378 --> 00:20:47,728
- this thing listed for sale?
- Me?

331
00:20:47,772 --> 00:20:49,426
What happened to honoring
a dying man's wishes?

332
00:20:49,469 --> 00:20:51,210
We'll honor him with a new double pump

333
00:20:51,254 --> 00:20:53,077
glycol draft beer chiller.

334
00:20:53,121 --> 00:20:54,735
Our ship has come in.

335
00:20:54,779 --> 00:20:56,085
Yeah.

336
00:20:56,128 --> 00:20:57,587
Hey, Blake, ready for another?

337
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,305
Uh, hey, Tracy, no.

338
00:20:59,349 --> 00:21:01,742
Uh, no, I'm good.

339
00:21:01,786 --> 00:21:02,830
Really?

340
00:21:04,528 --> 00:21:06,704
Why do I feel like
you're trying to get rid of me?

341
00:21:06,747 --> 00:21:07,748
What are you doing?

342
00:21:07,792 --> 00:21:09,098
Uncle Christopher's right there.

343
00:21:09,141 --> 00:21:11,167
Uncle Christopher doesn't care.

344
00:21:12,014 --> 00:21:13,368
What don't I care about?

345
00:21:16,757 --> 00:21:18,716
Yeah, Molly's.

346
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:19,935
Oh, hey, Trudy, yeah.

347
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:21,552
Mouch is right in front of me.

348
00:21:22,459 --> 00:21:24,308
Oh, yeah. Okay. Yeah, sure.

349
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,853
Uh, hang on.

350
00:21:25,897 --> 00:21:28,073
Um, she doesn't want to talk to you.

351
00:21:28,117 --> 00:21:29,977
It was bound to happen sooner or later.

352
00:21:32,034 --> 00:21:35,691
Kidd, it's Trudy, for you.

353
00:21:36,473 --> 00:21:38,910
Hey, lady, what's going on?

354
00:21:42,466 --> 00:21:45,599
He was picked up in West Town
on a drunk and disorderly,

355
00:21:45,624 --> 00:21:48,583
with a case to be made for assault,

356
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:52,757
except nobody's willing
to press charges.

357
00:21:52,782 --> 00:21:54,872
And here we are.

358
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,673
He one of yours?

359
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:02,301
Evening, Lieutenant.

360
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:07,504
Yeah, he belongs to me.

361
00:22:07,547 --> 00:22:09,071
Mm-hmm.

362
00:22:09,114 --> 00:22:12,291
If you barf in my car, I'm
dumping you on the Eisenhower.

363
00:22:12,335 --> 00:22:13,989
You don't have to worry about me.

364
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:16,426
I sobered up real quick
when I saw your scowling face.

365
00:22:16,469 --> 00:22:18,297
Do not get cute.

366
00:22:18,341 --> 00:22:20,299
If you think that you can go carousing,

367
00:22:20,343 --> 00:22:22,345
getting into trouble,
and then drop my name

368
00:22:22,388 --> 00:22:25,000
when the cops show up,
you better think twice.

369
00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:28,481
I didn't drop your name,
or I didn't mean to.

370
00:22:28,525 --> 00:22:30,614
I just made a crack
about how Lieutenant Kidd

371
00:22:30,657 --> 00:22:32,572
was gonna bury me
if I didn't show up for shift.

372
00:22:32,616 --> 00:22:34,618
I didn't know the desk sergeant
had you on speed dial.

373
00:22:34,661 --> 00:22:37,447
Don't you have anyone else at all

374
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:39,144
that you could have called
to come and bail you out?

375
00:22:39,188 --> 00:22:41,016
Any friends at all?

376
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:42,017
I got friends.

377
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,496
Do you?

378
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:45,886
Or are you just some
kind of train wreck?

379
00:22:49,111 --> 00:22:50,683
Listen, Lieutenant,

380
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:54,420
for all 24 hours
of every shift, you own my ass.

381
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:57,106
But when I punch out, that's my time.

382
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:00,386
What I do, who I am, that's my business.

383
00:23:00,557 --> 00:23:01,921
All you need to worry about

384
00:23:01,965 --> 00:23:04,280
is who shows up when I punch back in.

385
00:23:04,909 --> 00:23:06,563
And that's the best
firefighter you ever saw.

386
00:23:06,606 --> 00:23:08,075
Sure.

387
00:23:08,826 --> 00:23:10,262
Get in the car.

388
00:23:18,383 --> 00:23:19,970
Morning, Lieutenant.

389
00:23:20,013 --> 00:23:22,344
Came in a little early to get
started on the driver's side...

390
00:23:22,387 --> 00:23:24,175
should be able to finish
it all this shift.

391
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:29,830
How's the lip?

392
00:23:29,873 --> 00:23:31,975
It's nothing... totally fine.

393
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:36,312
You know, your accent really
comes out when you're drunk.

394
00:23:37,577 --> 00:23:39,482
What is that? Texas?

395
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:42,407
Listen, Lieutenant, you don't
need to mention anything

396
00:23:42,451 --> 00:23:45,193
to Boden about my little
misadventure, do you?

397
00:23:45,236 --> 00:23:47,674
It doesn't seem like the kind of
thing he needs to be bothered with.

398
00:23:53,593 --> 00:23:55,246
How about you worry
about those compartments,

399
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:57,684
you let me worry about how to do my job.

400
00:24:08,825 --> 00:24:10,221
Morning.

401
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,656
Yeah, morning.

402
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:29,365
Oh, my God, you're here.

403
00:24:30,325 --> 00:24:31,701
Hi.

404
00:24:32,675 --> 00:24:35,504
Violet, damn, girl.

405
00:24:35,548 --> 00:24:37,680
- She's mine!
- Man, it's good to see you.

406
00:24:37,724 --> 00:24:39,813
Like, so seriously good.

407
00:24:39,856 --> 00:24:42,598
Oh, my God, we really
missed you around here.

408
00:24:42,642 --> 00:24:44,034
It feels like
you've been gone for months.

409
00:24:44,078 --> 00:24:45,757
Thanks, you guys.

410
00:24:45,782 --> 00:24:47,741
I'm so glad you feel ready to be back.

411
00:24:48,212 --> 00:24:52,806
Yeah, I think I am.
Or at least, I hope so.

412
00:24:53,174 --> 00:24:55,698
Well, don't worry, we've got you.

413
00:24:55,742 --> 00:24:57,265
Yeah.

414
00:25:01,574 --> 00:25:02,923
Morning, Chief.

415
00:25:02,966 --> 00:25:04,692
Yeah, I suppose.

416
00:25:05,099 --> 00:25:06,448
I know that mood.

417
00:25:06,491 --> 00:25:09,233
It comes when you don't get good sleep.

418
00:25:09,277 --> 00:25:11,322
Little Kenny is the same way.

419
00:25:11,366 --> 00:25:13,237
I'm not sure
I appreciate the comparison,

420
00:25:13,281 --> 00:25:15,588
but yeah, you're right. I was up late.

421
00:25:15,631 --> 00:25:17,525
Can't stop thinking about that

422
00:25:17,821 --> 00:25:20,767
father from the beach call, Rob,

423
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:24,921
way he was blaming himself
for his kid's struggles.

424
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:28,216
I have the same guilt,

425
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:32,169
that I'm not there enough for Terrance,

426
00:25:32,213 --> 00:25:33,649
or in the right way.

427
00:25:33,693 --> 00:25:35,129
I hear that.

428
00:25:35,172 --> 00:25:38,768
I got too many kids, too little time.

429
00:25:39,046 --> 00:25:40,134
Yeah, but we're lucky, though.

430
00:25:40,177 --> 00:25:42,005
You know, we're firefighters.

431
00:25:42,049 --> 00:25:43,659
We got an eye on each other's kids too.

432
00:25:43,703 --> 00:25:46,227
Like, Harvey was so happy to
meet up with you and Terrance

433
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:49,099
the other day,
just dads and boys together.

434
00:25:49,143 --> 00:25:52,537
Hey, me and my kids weren't invited?

435
00:25:52,581 --> 00:25:53,843
Okay, look, I'm sorry, Herrmann,

436
00:25:53,887 --> 00:25:55,845
but Javi's scared of Annabelle.

437
00:25:55,889 --> 00:25:58,204
So? Who isn't?

438
00:25:58,718 --> 00:26:01,634
Herrmann, get in here.
You got to see this.

439
00:26:04,844 --> 00:26:06,106
- Just...
- What's happening?

440
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:07,393
Hurry up. The snipers are descending.

441
00:26:07,418 --> 00:26:09,072
- What? Snipers?
- Yeah.

442
00:26:09,097 --> 00:26:10,838
Uh, the real action with an eBay sale

443
00:26:10,863 --> 00:26:12,168
happens right at the end.

444
00:26:12,193 --> 00:26:14,108
That's when the bidders
try to snipe one another

445
00:26:14,133 --> 00:26:15,535
with a last second bid.

446
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,824
And they're sniping like crazy.

447
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:18,825
Where are we at?

448
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:20,668
Up to $5,000.

449
00:26:20,711 --> 00:26:22,437
- Oh, man.
- 5,500.

450
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,265
- Now 6,000.
- Oh, 6,500.

451
00:26:24,308 --> 00:26:26,833
Oh, is this real?

452
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:29,009
You guys aren't pulling some
kind of prank on me, yeah?

453
00:26:29,052 --> 00:26:30,488
What?

454
00:26:30,532 --> 00:26:31,838
7,000.

455
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:33,622
Ooh.

456
00:26:33,666 --> 00:26:36,103
- Herrmann, you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

457
00:26:36,146 --> 00:26:38,627
I just got... whew.

458
00:26:38,671 --> 00:26:40,498
A few seconds left and still climbing.

459
00:26:40,542 --> 00:26:42,370
Yeah, this is... this is when the bots

460
00:26:42,413 --> 00:26:43,632
should start kicking in.

461
00:26:43,676 --> 00:26:45,068
There's bots now?

462
00:26:45,112 --> 00:26:47,244
- Go, go, go, go, go, go.
- This is insane.

463
00:26:47,288 --> 00:26:49,464
- Holy.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

464
00:26:49,507 --> 00:26:52,216
Holy crow.

465
00:26:53,294 --> 00:26:56,166
- What? What happened?
- Final sale price...

466
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:57,820
12 grand.

467
00:26:57,864 --> 00:27:01,563
$12,000 for a musty beer
stein... not too shabby.

468
00:27:01,606 --> 00:27:04,305
I'm sorry, did you hear
what he just said?

469
00:27:04,348 --> 00:27:06,916
You made $12,000.

470
00:27:13,227 --> 00:27:15,620
Ambulance 61, person in distress,

471
00:27:15,664 --> 00:27:19,755
21466 North Lincoln Park West.

472
00:27:22,548 --> 00:27:24,107
- Ready?
- Let's do this.

473
00:27:24,151 --> 00:27:25,761
Ooh.

474
00:27:25,805 --> 00:27:28,285
- What took you so long?
- It was only...

475
00:27:28,329 --> 00:27:30,157
My husband, David, you have to help him.

476
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,593
He's so out of it.

477
00:27:31,636 --> 00:27:33,203
He was talking about how his chest hurt.

478
00:27:33,247 --> 00:27:35,597
And then, he just got all weird, like...

479
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,120
like he didn't know where he was.

480
00:27:37,164 --> 00:27:39,079
- David, can you hear me?
- David? David?

481
00:27:39,122 --> 00:27:40,558
He was awake a second ago.

482
00:27:40,602 --> 00:27:41,995
Does your husband have
any history of heart trouble?

483
00:27:42,038 --> 00:27:43,823
Yes, totally... he just
got back from the hospital

484
00:27:43,866 --> 00:27:46,312
a couple of days ago
after open-heart surgery.

485
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:48,262
Blood pressure's really low.

486
00:27:48,305 --> 00:27:49,742
Heart sounds are muffled.

487
00:27:51,744 --> 00:27:53,180
- Brett.
- JVD.

488
00:27:53,223 --> 00:27:54,529
- What's that mean?
- Your husband has a tamponade,

489
00:27:54,572 --> 00:27:55,617
which means blood
is building up in the space

490
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,140
between the heart and pericardium.

491
00:27:57,184 --> 00:27:59,142
His wound's opening up.
We gotta get him to Med fast.

492
00:27:59,186 --> 00:28:01,188
Blood pressure that low,
he won't make it.

493
00:28:01,231 --> 00:28:04,104
We need to reduce
that fluid buildup now.

494
00:28:04,147 --> 00:28:05,758
Are you sure, Vi?

495
00:28:05,801 --> 00:28:07,629
I've seen CT surgeons do this in the ER.

496
00:28:07,672 --> 00:28:08,761
We got this.

497
00:28:25,863 --> 00:28:27,161
What did you do to him?

498
00:28:27,204 --> 00:28:29,124
I know this looks scary,
but this is good.

499
00:28:29,168 --> 00:28:31,656
Releasing the blood is exactly
what we needed to happen.

500
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,136
His blood pressure's already coming up.

501
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:35,834
She just saved his life.

502
00:28:35,878 --> 00:28:37,206
David?

503
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:38,489
Baby?

504
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,667
Gentle. Gentle.

505
00:28:44,234 --> 00:28:46,403
Up and over. Careful.

506
00:28:47,498 --> 00:28:49,500
You'll be okay, baby.

507
00:28:49,544 --> 00:28:50,545
Okay. Now we need to move fast.

508
00:28:50,588 --> 00:28:51,850
Let's get him to the hospital.

509
00:28:51,894 --> 00:28:53,118
Let's go.

510
00:28:54,462 --> 00:28:56,638
So then, he has the nerve to tell me

511
00:28:56,681 --> 00:28:58,466
that I shouldn't mention
anything to Boden

512
00:28:58,509 --> 00:29:01,556
about his little misadventure.

513
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:04,421
He told you or asked you?

514
00:29:04,863 --> 00:29:06,735
I mean, it may have been
phrased as a question,

515
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:08,824
but the implication was,
don't rat me out,

516
00:29:08,867 --> 00:29:10,521
like I'm supposed to help Carver

517
00:29:10,565 --> 00:29:12,929
cover up his conduct unbecoming.

518
00:29:13,481 --> 00:29:15,744
So did you report it to Boden?

519
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:19,008
I wasn't planning on it until
Carver opened up his mouth.

520
00:29:19,051 --> 00:29:22,664
Now I'm thinking,
maybe I should loop Boden in.

521
00:29:22,707 --> 00:29:23,795
Hmm.

522
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:27,799
Well, now's your chance. Here he is.

523
00:29:27,843 --> 00:29:29,192
Hey, Chief.

524
00:29:29,235 --> 00:29:30,697
Severide, Kidd.

525
00:29:34,284 --> 00:29:35,535
Is everything okay?

526
00:29:38,288 --> 00:29:40,039
Yes, fine.

527
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:43,685
I saw Carver out there getting up close

528
00:29:43,728 --> 00:29:45,837
and personal with the truck.

529
00:29:46,339 --> 00:29:47,547
How's he working out?

530
00:29:50,518 --> 00:29:53,887
So far, so good.

531
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:56,306
Yeah.

532
00:30:02,878 --> 00:30:04,105
All right, then.

533
00:30:07,317 --> 00:30:09,486
Don't start.

534
00:30:11,103 --> 00:30:14,933
I'm also gonna need a half
dozen ball lock disconnects,

535
00:30:14,977 --> 00:30:19,024
a half dozen keg couplers,
and 50 feet of beer line.

536
00:30:19,068 --> 00:30:20,548
Hey, am I forgetting anything?

537
00:30:20,591 --> 00:30:22,027
- Regulator.
- Oh, right.

538
00:30:22,071 --> 00:30:24,290
Hey, Ronnie, what do you got
in the way of,

539
00:30:24,334 --> 00:30:26,205
uh, you know, secondary regulators?

540
00:30:26,249 --> 00:30:27,555
Uh-huh.

541
00:30:27,598 --> 00:30:30,079
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

542
00:30:30,122 --> 00:30:32,690
All right. Let's go with the five way.

543
00:30:32,734 --> 00:30:34,605
And, uh, don't give me any of that

544
00:30:34,649 --> 00:30:35,954
cheap zinc crap, all right.

545
00:30:35,998 --> 00:30:37,390
Give me the good stuff.

546
00:30:37,434 --> 00:30:39,828
What do you care about
where the money comes from?

547
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:41,656
Maybe we knocked over
an armored truck, all right.

548
00:30:41,699 --> 00:30:44,310
Just give me the total. Mm-hmm.

549
00:30:44,354 --> 00:30:45,877
He can install everything tomorrow.

550
00:30:45,921 --> 00:30:48,010
- Perfect.
- All right. Great.

551
00:30:48,053 --> 00:30:49,489
Ah.

552
00:30:49,533 --> 00:30:50,926
Yeah, we will have the check waiting,

553
00:30:50,969 --> 00:30:53,015
and we will see you then.

554
00:30:53,058 --> 00:30:54,146
All right.

555
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:56,148
- We're in business!
- Oh!

556
00:30:56,192 --> 00:30:57,628
Oh!

557
00:30:57,672 --> 00:30:59,978
Oh, jeez!

558
00:31:00,022 --> 00:31:04,983
Herrmann, it's called
situational awareness.

559
00:31:05,027 --> 00:31:06,419
I'm sorry, brother.

560
00:31:06,463 --> 00:31:08,334
That was a hell of a catch, though.

561
00:31:13,644 --> 00:31:16,952
Are we maybe being a little
too heartless, you know,

562
00:31:16,995 --> 00:31:20,738
hocking a gift from the dead
for cold hard cash?

563
00:31:20,782 --> 00:31:22,479
It's a little late to grow a conscience.

564
00:31:22,522 --> 00:31:24,394
You just spent the money.

565
00:31:24,644 --> 00:31:25,776
Yeah.

566
00:31:29,181 --> 00:31:31,234
Do we have any left over?

567
00:31:31,575 --> 00:31:33,838
Maybe we throw a little
memorial type thing

568
00:31:33,882 --> 00:31:36,865
and pay our respects
to the old-timer that way.

569
00:31:37,581 --> 00:31:39,909
- Nice idea.
- Yeah.

570
00:31:41,063 --> 00:31:43,413
He was in damn good shape
when we dropped him off.

571
00:31:43,456 --> 00:31:45,502
That was something,
you cutting those wires.

572
00:31:45,545 --> 00:31:46,851
You thought I was crazy.

573
00:31:46,895 --> 00:31:49,898
No, I was just being cautious.

574
00:31:49,941 --> 00:31:53,031
Too cautious, because you were so right.

575
00:31:53,075 --> 00:31:54,337
You nailed it.

576
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,544
Thanks, PIC.

577
00:31:57,427 --> 00:31:58,950
Oh, I can't believe this.

578
00:31:58,994 --> 00:32:00,125
What?

579
00:32:00,169 --> 00:32:01,561
Uh, it's the nurse at Med.

580
00:32:01,605 --> 00:32:03,346
She says that Gabriel Evans'
victim, he's...

581
00:32:03,389 --> 00:32:05,087
he's out of the coma.

582
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:07,117
Oh, my God. Hey, hold on.

583
00:32:23,671 --> 00:32:25,368
I don't know why it didn't occur to me

584
00:32:25,411 --> 00:32:27,248
that his family would be there.

585
00:32:27,762 --> 00:32:29,125
Of course they are.

586
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:35,274
Maybe you could go in
and introduce yourself.

587
00:32:35,378 --> 00:32:36,883
No, I...

588
00:32:37,728 --> 00:32:40,122
I don't even know what I was gonna say.

589
00:32:40,165 --> 00:32:44,474
But I am sure as hell not gonna
interrupt that beautiful scene.

590
00:32:45,758 --> 00:32:47,108
Look at that.

591
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,569
Evan saved him, Sylvie.

592
00:32:56,225 --> 00:32:57,403
Yes, he did.

593
00:33:14,669 --> 00:33:16,187
It's end of shift.

594
00:33:16,284 --> 00:33:18,547
Isn't there a bar fight
waiting for you somewhere?

595
00:33:18,991 --> 00:33:21,254
Just staying till this paint is dry,

596
00:33:21,297 --> 00:33:22,610
then I'll go raise hell.

597
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,609
It's not bad work, Carver.

598
00:33:28,652 --> 00:33:30,480
- Thanks, Lieutenant.
- Yeah.

599
00:33:30,524 --> 00:33:33,537
And thanks for not
reporting me to Boden.

600
00:33:36,573 --> 00:33:37,917
Yet.

601
00:33:38,184 --> 00:33:39,502
Yet?

602
00:33:39,968 --> 00:33:41,926
I don't need Boden to put you on notice.

603
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:43,841
I already did that myself.

604
00:33:43,885 --> 00:33:45,713
But if I get another call from PD

605
00:33:45,756 --> 00:33:50,388
or so much as catch a whiff
of mischief coming off of you,

606
00:33:51,043 --> 00:33:52,473
I'll make him aware of it.

607
00:33:56,115 --> 00:33:58,247
Look, that guy you found
in the cooler the other night,

608
00:33:58,291 --> 00:34:00,119
you don't have to worry about him.

609
00:34:00,398 --> 00:34:02,251
This is the guy who's gonna
show up at the firehouse,

610
00:34:02,295 --> 00:34:03,557
shift after shift.

611
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,732
The best firefighter.

612
00:34:04,775 --> 00:34:06,560
The best firefighter that I ever saw.

613
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:10,738
You said that already.

614
00:34:10,781 --> 00:34:12,660
I did? When?

615
00:34:13,131 --> 00:34:16,003
Look, just stay out of trouble, Carver.

616
00:34:18,615 --> 00:34:22,967
Hey, Chief, see you
at our Molly's event later?

617
00:34:23,011 --> 00:34:24,404
Actually, no.

618
00:34:24,447 --> 00:34:26,145
Give my apologies
to Herrmann, would you?

619
00:34:26,548 --> 00:34:27,810
Sure thing.

620
00:34:34,762 --> 00:34:36,155
Hey.

621
00:34:36,198 --> 00:34:37,547
You have a minute?

622
00:34:37,591 --> 00:34:39,071
Yeah, I have a whole bunch of them.

623
00:34:39,114 --> 00:34:40,246
Come on in.

624
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:57,611
How do you live
with that hole in your heart,

625
00:34:57,654 --> 00:35:02,616
feeling that every part of you is empty?

626
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,881
Yeah.

627
00:35:08,963 --> 00:35:11,969
I'm no expert in grief, that's for sure.

628
00:35:13,844 --> 00:35:18,851
But my feeling is, all you
can do is think of them,

629
00:35:19,633 --> 00:35:23,115
talk about them as much as you can,

630
00:35:23,158 --> 00:35:24,725
so in some way...

631
00:35:27,624 --> 00:35:29,445
It's like they're still here.

632
00:35:51,926 --> 00:35:54,624
Time me... I'll get up there
so fast, it'll set a record.

633
00:35:54,668 --> 00:35:56,974
I'm gonna touch that tippy top blue one.

634
00:35:57,018 --> 00:35:58,193
Me too.

635
00:35:58,237 --> 00:35:59,673
It's not about how fast
you get up there.

636
00:35:59,716 --> 00:36:01,240
Yeah, just take it nice and easy,

637
00:36:01,283 --> 00:36:02,502
at least the first time, all right?

638
00:36:02,545 --> 00:36:03,851
Okay, you two, you got half an hour.

639
00:36:03,894 --> 00:36:06,332
Donna is putting together
a dinner for us all.

640
00:36:06,375 --> 00:36:07,507
She don't cook often.

641
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:08,945
Like, never.

642
00:36:08,988 --> 00:36:10,654
Hey, go on, get.

643
00:36:19,606 --> 00:36:22,043
- Look at that.
- Hey!

644
00:36:22,086 --> 00:36:25,568
The inaugural pint from our
new and improved tap system.

645
00:36:25,612 --> 00:36:28,180
The first one might taste
a little metallic,

646
00:36:28,223 --> 00:36:30,756
but that'll go away.

647
00:36:31,226 --> 00:36:35,553
Now, four words you'll never
hear me say again...

648
00:36:37,189 --> 00:36:38,581
Drinks on the house.

649
00:36:45,893 --> 00:36:49,244
I'm... I'm kind of surprised
Carver isn't here.

650
00:36:49,288 --> 00:36:50,985
You sure he knew it was happening?

651
00:36:51,277 --> 00:36:54,902
He was right there when
Herrmann invited everyone.

652
00:37:04,085 --> 00:37:05,739
Where'd that come from?

653
00:37:05,782 --> 00:37:09,879
From me, knowing what a
difference you made to Violet,

654
00:37:10,265 --> 00:37:11,745
getting her back to work.

655
00:37:14,226 --> 00:37:16,184
It wasn't just me.

656
00:37:16,228 --> 00:37:17,229
It was everyone.

657
00:37:17,272 --> 00:37:19,274
I knew you would say that.

658
00:37:19,318 --> 00:37:24,497
One of the many reasons
you are my perfect man.

659
00:37:31,286 --> 00:37:32,940
Maybe she's right, you know,

660
00:37:32,983 --> 00:37:34,550
maybe Herrmann doesn't care
if you two are dating.

661
00:37:34,594 --> 00:37:36,596
- Hanging out.
- Uh-huh.

662
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:38,641
I mean, what is he gonna do?
She's a grown-ass woman.

663
00:37:38,685 --> 00:37:40,252
That she is.

664
00:37:40,295 --> 00:37:42,384
You know, it would be nice
to keep it going while we can

665
00:37:42,428 --> 00:37:45,431
'cause that girl is F-U-N, fun.

666
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,043
Here you go.

667
00:37:49,086 --> 00:37:50,503
Thanks, Tracy.

668
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:53,613
You value your life, Capp?

669
00:37:53,656 --> 00:37:55,919
Keep your distance.

670
00:38:00,881 --> 00:38:03,579
Ladies and gents, here's to Stephanides,

671
00:38:03,623 --> 00:38:06,060
who's served us well.

672
00:38:06,103 --> 00:38:08,984
Let's hope he's in heaven
and not in hell.

673
00:38:24,731 --> 00:38:26,733
What's going on here?

674
00:38:26,776 --> 00:38:31,477
Stephanides, but you're not...

675
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,000
I mean...

676
00:38:34,741 --> 00:38:36,264
We got your beer stein.

677
00:38:36,308 --> 00:38:37,526
Great!

678
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:39,354
That's why I'm here, to pick it up.

679
00:38:39,398 --> 00:38:42,009
- She's a beaut, isn't she?
- Yeah.

680
00:38:42,052 --> 00:38:44,359
And I had them ship it
to my old business address

681
00:38:44,403 --> 00:38:47,319
because of tax purposes.

682
00:38:47,362 --> 00:38:48,363
Where is it?

683
00:38:48,407 --> 00:38:50,563
I'm dying to see it in person.

684
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:52,585
Well...

685
00:38:54,761 --> 00:38:58,373
That's him, Evan.

686
00:39:01,071 --> 00:39:04,466
He was the only one who saw you
fall out of that door

687
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:06,245
overcome with smoke.

688
00:39:06,947 --> 00:39:08,539
And, um,

689
00:39:09,558 --> 00:39:11,125
he knew he was supposed to stay out

690
00:39:11,168 --> 00:39:12,885
of the collapse zone, but

691
00:39:13,446 --> 00:39:15,970
he could see you weren't gonna
make it out on your own.

692
00:39:16,106 --> 00:39:20,067
So he ran in to help.

693
00:39:20,177 --> 00:39:22,615
That is a brave man.

694
00:39:28,708 --> 00:39:31,145
Is it okay if, um...

695
00:39:31,885 --> 00:39:34,540
can I tell you a little bit
about who he was?

696
00:39:34,583 --> 00:39:38,544
Yes, I'd like that very much.

697
00:39:44,941 --> 00:39:48,554
Evan was the kind of guy...

698
00:39:56,823 --> 00:39:58,738
Evan was the kind of guy
who could make someone

699
00:39:58,781 --> 00:40:02,301
feel like the center of the universe...

700
00:40:06,789 --> 00:40:11,751
And was worth risking everything for.
