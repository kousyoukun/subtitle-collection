1
00:00:04,526 --> 00:00:06,789
Why did you take my squad lieutenant

2
00:00:06,832 --> 00:00:08,051
out of commission on a day's notice?

3
00:00:08,095 --> 00:00:09,487
This is the best arson investigation

4
00:00:09,531 --> 00:00:10,880
training program in the world.

5
00:00:10,923 --> 00:00:13,491
It's the opportunity
of a lifetime for Severide.

6
00:00:13,535 --> 00:00:15,015
Carver, is it?

7
00:00:15,058 --> 00:00:16,581
- Sam.
- Hi, Sam.

8
00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:18,496
You know, it's not my fault
I didn't make it home.

9
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:23,675
Maybe if you weren't
so distracting and fun.

10
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:27,157
I'm worried that everything
you've been feeling lately

11
00:00:27,201 --> 00:00:28,463
isn't really about me.

12
00:00:28,506 --> 00:00:29,681
You think it's about Evan.

13
00:00:29,725 --> 00:00:31,473
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:32,423 --> 00:00:35,513
Your mom has cancer,
and that really, really sucks.

15
00:00:35,557 --> 00:00:40,083
It's okay to talk about it
and cry about it.

16
00:00:40,127 --> 00:00:41,689
Can't keep it bottled up.

17
00:00:44,131 --> 00:00:46,655
So I've been thinking about the fact

18
00:00:46,698 --> 00:00:49,919
that tomorrow is your
last chemo treatment.

19
00:00:49,962 --> 00:00:51,573
At least for now.

20
00:00:51,616 --> 00:00:53,531
I think we should celebrate,
have a little party at Molly's.

21
00:00:53,575 --> 00:00:55,925
What if I have to go
through another round?

22
00:00:55,968 --> 00:00:57,100
We don't know yet.

23
00:00:57,144 --> 00:00:59,407
Well... come on.

24
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,234
That's then, this is now.

25
00:01:01,277 --> 00:01:03,846
Cin, we don't get a lot
of good news these days.

26
00:01:03,889 --> 00:01:05,891
You made it through that round
like a champ.

27
00:01:05,935 --> 00:01:08,633
You deserve to celebrate.

28
00:01:08,676 --> 00:01:09,764
No.

29
00:01:09,808 --> 00:01:12,723
I... I don't wanna go out
looking like this.

30
00:01:12,767 --> 00:01:14,204
You look great.

31
00:01:14,248 --> 00:01:15,901
Don't even try it.

32
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,385
It's a very sweet idea,
but I'm not great company

33
00:01:21,429 --> 00:01:23,083
right now for anyone.

34
00:01:23,126 --> 00:01:24,910
Let's put a pin in that, okay?

35
00:01:24,954 --> 00:01:27,279
Okay. Whatever you want.

36
00:01:28,392 --> 00:01:30,090
Dylan and I did a dive bar tour.

37
00:01:30,133 --> 00:01:31,830
It was fun. How about you two?

38
00:01:31,874 --> 00:01:33,658
I was laid up with the flu.

39
00:01:33,702 --> 00:01:35,530
My weekend was worse, I guarantee it.

40
00:01:35,573 --> 00:01:38,533
That girl Alyssa, she turned
out to be a complete psycho.

41
00:01:38,576 --> 00:01:40,100
She...

42
00:01:41,491 --> 00:01:43,407
Hey, guys. How was the weekend?

43
00:01:43,451 --> 00:01:45,104
- Lame.
- Amazing.

44
00:01:45,148 --> 00:01:47,090
Wow, lucky you.

45
00:01:47,585 --> 00:01:50,010
I can't do this with you two again.

46
00:01:50,458 --> 00:01:52,938
Carver, you're crowding the driveway.

47
00:01:52,982 --> 00:01:54,473
Don't get a ticket, man.

48
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:58,205
I'd rather risk a ticket
than lose my tools.

49
00:01:58,247 --> 00:01:59,554
Figure nobody will break in
if I'm parked

50
00:01:59,597 --> 00:02:01,538
right in front of the firehouse.

51
00:02:02,252 --> 00:02:04,559
I got a construction gig
right after shift.

52
00:02:04,602 --> 00:02:05,864
Oh, I thought you quit construction.

53
00:02:05,908 --> 00:02:07,709
I did, but then my brother
cleaned me out,

54
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:08,911
so I need the cash.

55
00:02:08,954 --> 00:02:13,437
Is it just me, or is this
the manliest car on the planet?

56
00:02:13,481 --> 00:02:15,744
This thing's like
an environmental disaster.

57
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,312
No offense.

58
00:02:20,832 --> 00:02:22,446
So how are you enjoying the view

59
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,187
from the front seat of Squad, Joe?

60
00:02:24,231 --> 00:02:26,841
Huh, uh, feels good, Chief.

61
00:02:26,885 --> 00:02:28,974
I, uh, like it.

62
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:33,849
Well, you really handled your
crew during that stable fire.

63
00:02:33,892 --> 00:02:35,026
Thank you, Chief.

64
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:38,767
But, um, it may be a while
before Severide is back.

65
00:02:40,377 --> 00:02:42,553
If the additional responsibility

66
00:02:42,597 --> 00:02:45,208
is getting to be a burden,
I can shuffle schedules,

67
00:02:45,252 --> 00:02:46,601
bring in a relief lieutenant.

68
00:02:46,644 --> 00:02:48,298
No, no, Chief.

69
00:02:48,341 --> 00:02:49,861
I got this.

70
00:02:50,344 --> 00:02:51,780
Glad to hear it.

71
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:56,088
I got a floater in
to fill in your empty seat,

72
00:02:56,132 --> 00:02:58,090
a Keith Bamford.

73
00:02:58,134 --> 00:02:59,621
Do you know him?

74
00:03:00,136 --> 00:03:01,355
No, I don't think so.

75
00:03:01,398 --> 00:03:02,747
Well, he's out there somewhere.

76
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:04,706
Why don't you go
and make his acquaintance?

77
00:03:04,749 --> 00:03:05,924
Will do.

78
00:03:07,796 --> 00:03:09,276
Thanks, Chief.

79
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:10,842
Go get 'em.

80
00:03:12,409 --> 00:03:13,889
Bachelor party!

81
00:03:16,761 --> 00:03:18,285
No, listen. No, for real, though.

82
00:03:18,328 --> 00:03:20,243
I swear I've seen you around somewhere.

83
00:03:20,287 --> 00:03:22,114
You ever spent any time in Squad 1?

84
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:23,333
- No.
- Wait a minute.

85
00:03:23,377 --> 00:03:24,334
You know what it is?

86
00:03:24,378 --> 00:03:25,857
I've seen you on TV.

87
00:03:25,901 --> 00:03:27,468
Capp? On TV?

88
00:03:27,511 --> 00:03:28,860
You mean like on the news maybe?

89
00:03:28,904 --> 00:03:30,949
- At a scene?
- Oh, you know what?

90
00:03:30,993 --> 00:03:32,429
You know who I'm thinking of?

91
00:03:32,473 --> 00:03:33,865
I'm thinking of Uncle Fester.

92
00:03:35,867 --> 00:03:38,566
Honest mistake.

93
00:03:38,609 --> 00:03:40,567
Oh, listen, where is
Lieutenant Severide, anyway?

94
00:03:40,611 --> 00:03:42,396
The man, the legend?
I'm dying to meet this guy.

95
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:43,832
Oh, Severide's on furlough.

96
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,834
We've been taking our orders from Cruz.

97
00:03:45,877 --> 00:03:47,704
Oh, hey. Joe Cruz.

98
00:03:47,749 --> 00:03:49,185
I'm just acting up for a while.

99
00:03:49,228 --> 00:03:50,882
All right. Good for you. Bamford.

100
00:03:50,926 --> 00:03:52,057
- Welcome aboard, Bamford.
- Thanks.

101
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,799
Truck 81, 1349 North Edna.

102
00:03:54,843 --> 00:03:56,714
- That's me.
- Wellness check.

103
00:03:56,758 --> 00:03:59,151
Enjoy your wellness check, truckie.

104
00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:22,392
Main, this is Truck 81
on scene at 1349 Edna.

105
00:04:22,436 --> 00:04:25,165
Do you have an apartment number for us?

106
00:04:25,787 --> 00:04:28,180
Okay, thanks.

107
00:04:28,224 --> 00:04:31,793
So someone just called,
asked for the fire department,

108
00:04:31,836 --> 00:04:33,751
and then hung up.

109
00:04:33,795 --> 00:04:35,623
Let's do a quick walk through.

110
00:04:41,629 --> 00:04:43,326
All right, Gallo, Carver,

111
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:45,415
you start at the top,
work your way down.

112
00:04:45,459 --> 00:04:46,796
Me and Mouch,

113
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,056
we'll work our way up from one,
meet in the middle.

114
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,207
Copy.

115
00:04:51,421 --> 00:04:53,423
Fire department. Anybody home?

116
00:04:54,556 --> 00:04:56,029
Fire department.

117
00:04:56,992 --> 00:04:59,124
Hey, somebody called in
and asked for help.

118
00:04:59,168 --> 00:05:00,735
Do you know any...

119
00:05:05,174 --> 00:05:06,523
Fire department.

120
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:10,801
Hello?

121
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,362
Did you call 911, ma'am?

122
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,418
My boy. He needs help.

123
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,683
Excuse me, ma'am. Stand over there.

124
00:05:35,726 --> 00:05:36,901
Lieutenant, we have
an injured child upstairs.

125
00:05:36,945 --> 00:05:39,164
Stand by while we check him out.

126
00:05:39,207 --> 00:05:40,601
Copy that.

127
00:05:40,644 --> 00:05:42,777
Hey there, buddy.
I'm Sam. What's your name?

128
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:43,734
Tyler.

129
00:05:43,778 --> 00:05:45,287
Let's have a look at you.

130
00:05:50,885 --> 00:05:52,526
What happened to you, Tyler?

131
00:05:52,569 --> 00:05:54,397
I got shot.

132
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:06,307
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

133
00:06:07,682 --> 00:06:10,413
- Sure looks like a GSW.
- It can't be, can it?

134
00:06:10,457 --> 00:06:11,545
Ma'am, what happened to him?

135
00:06:11,588 --> 00:06:13,416
Can't you just patch it up?

136
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,505
He needs a doctor to look at this.

137
00:06:15,549 --> 00:06:16,593
Tell Kidd to roll an ambulance.

138
00:06:16,637 --> 00:06:18,378
- Got it.
- Wa... wait, please.

139
00:06:18,421 --> 00:06:20,075
No sirens.

140
00:06:20,118 --> 00:06:22,425
Ma'am, what's going on here?

141
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:24,109
Please, I just need you to fix him.

142
00:06:24,152 --> 00:06:25,388
He's okay.

143
00:06:25,432 --> 00:06:26,995
We just need to stop the bleeding.

144
00:06:30,215 --> 00:06:32,130
Gallo, grab the jump bag.

145
00:06:32,174 --> 00:06:33,349
On it.

146
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:48,233
- What's your name, Mom?
- Ariel.

147
00:06:48,277 --> 00:06:50,497
Ariel, this isn't a grazing injury.

148
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,020
This is a penetrating wound.

149
00:06:52,063 --> 00:06:54,152
If he was shot, the bullet
is still in there somewhere.

150
00:06:57,634 --> 00:06:59,361
Lieutenant.

151
00:06:59,984 --> 00:07:01,856
- We need an ambulance.
- What's going on?

152
00:07:01,899 --> 00:07:03,292
A little boy said
he got shot in the head.

153
00:07:03,335 --> 00:07:05,163
He said he got shot in the head?

154
00:07:05,207 --> 00:07:07,514
Yeah. I mean, he's alert and talking.

155
00:07:07,557 --> 00:07:09,124
- Is he why we were called?
- I don't know.

156
00:07:09,167 --> 00:07:10,342
But I gotta get the jump bag.

157
00:07:10,386 --> 00:07:11,909
Okay, go.

158
00:07:11,953 --> 00:07:16,566
All right, 81 to Main, we need
an ambulance at 1349 Edna.

159
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:17,959
Vice should send a squad car too.

160
00:07:18,002 --> 00:07:19,134
Copy that.

161
00:07:22,551 --> 00:07:24,705
Hey, throw me that cloth,
would you, Fester?

162
00:07:24,748 --> 00:07:25,880
His name is Capp.

163
00:07:25,923 --> 00:07:27,795
It's a joke, dude. He knows that.

164
00:07:27,838 --> 00:07:29,100
It's cool.

165
00:07:41,765 --> 00:07:43,201
Finished already, Bamford?

166
00:07:43,245 --> 00:07:44,349
Yep.

167
00:07:44,393 --> 00:07:45,900
I don't mess around.

168
00:07:47,336 --> 00:07:49,686
Ambulance 61, 1349 North Edna,

169
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:51,383
- person injured.
- Edna?

170
00:07:51,427 --> 00:07:53,197
Ain't that where Truck just went?

171
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,996
Is it? I don't know.

172
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,998
I guess they caught
some action after all.

173
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:59,566
Good for them.

174
00:08:07,574 --> 00:08:10,098
How'd this happen? Where were you?

175
00:08:10,141 --> 00:08:12,142
Right here.

176
00:08:20,282 --> 00:08:22,153
The shot came from next door?

177
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,809
Fire department, open up.

178
00:08:25,853 --> 00:08:27,811
It's gonna be okay. We got you.

179
00:08:32,381 --> 00:08:33,496
We got you.

180
00:08:35,078 --> 00:08:36,211
Gallo.

181
00:08:36,254 --> 00:08:37,647
- Yeah.
- Shh.

182
00:08:40,045 --> 00:08:41,520
Oh, damn.

183
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:43,044
The wall must have
slowed the bullet down.

184
00:08:43,087 --> 00:08:45,481
That's why Tyler here
is still on two feet.

185
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,048
Tough as nails.

186
00:08:47,091 --> 00:08:48,484
But we have to get him to the hospital.

187
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,659
Ambo's on the way.

188
00:08:49,703 --> 00:08:51,574
I just... I just
didn't wanna cause a fuss

189
00:08:51,618 --> 00:08:53,620
'cause it wouldn't start
nothing but trouble.

190
00:08:53,663 --> 00:08:55,012
Ma'am, what's really going on here?

191
00:08:55,056 --> 00:08:57,711
It's just a fight over turf.

192
00:08:57,754 --> 00:08:59,060
What else?

193
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,325
So go back outside, wait for the medics,

194
00:09:03,368 --> 00:09:04,979
and I'll find Gallo and Carver.

195
00:09:05,022 --> 00:09:06,023
Gotcha.

196
00:09:37,141 --> 00:09:39,187
Gallo, Carver, where you at?

197
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:41,537
Apartment 3-D, Lieutenant.

198
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,684
Hey, guys.

199
00:09:57,727 --> 00:09:59,642
Take it somewhere else, huh?

200
00:09:59,686 --> 00:10:00,834
You better get lost.

201
00:10:02,689 --> 00:10:04,560
Lieutenant, you got trouble
headed your way.

202
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,693
You guys need to clear out now.

203
00:10:08,738 --> 00:10:09,843
Okay, we're coming.

204
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:12,960
Whoa.

205
00:10:24,188 --> 00:10:26,359
Gallo, Carver, take cover now.

206
00:10:28,845 --> 00:10:31,674
Hey, cops are on their way.
You better clear out.

207
00:10:31,718 --> 00:10:34,764
Shh.

208
00:10:47,081 --> 00:10:48,691
Where the hell are those cops?

209
00:10:48,735 --> 00:10:50,214
They're on scene now.

210
00:10:53,217 --> 00:10:55,524
I got three firefighters
pinned down by gunfire

211
00:10:55,567 --> 00:10:57,700
on the third floor, some kind
of gang war activity.

212
00:10:57,744 --> 00:10:59,702
- How many shooters?
- I saw four go in.

213
00:10:59,746 --> 00:11:01,835
No idea how many were already in there.

214
00:11:01,878 --> 00:11:06,056
Dispatch 9-13, I need
a 10-1 at 1349 Edna.

215
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,057
Shots fired.

216
00:11:15,892 --> 00:11:17,328
Play baseball?

217
00:11:17,372 --> 00:11:19,412
Catch mostly, when there's
anyone to play with.

218
00:11:21,942 --> 00:11:23,291
Played football when I was a kid.

219
00:11:23,334 --> 00:11:27,077
When I was scared, and I'm scared a lot,

220
00:11:27,121 --> 00:11:28,339
I would just think about
being on the field

221
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,714
throwing that ball around.

222
00:11:31,925 --> 00:11:33,388
Can you do that?

223
00:11:33,431 --> 00:11:35,738
Just imagine you're outside
with your friend playing catch.

224
00:11:35,782 --> 00:11:37,537
Not got a thing in the world
to worry about.

225
00:12:16,953 --> 00:12:18,781
Gallo, Carver, let's go.

226
00:12:18,825 --> 00:12:20,609
- All clear. North stairs.
- All right. Let's go.

227
00:12:20,652 --> 00:12:21,915
Okay. Stand up, buddy.

228
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:24,700
I got you. Come on.

229
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,268
- Come on, let's go, baby.
- I got you.

230
00:12:27,311 --> 00:12:28,748
Go, go.

231
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:30,097
North stairs, go.

232
00:12:33,491 --> 00:12:35,493
Stay low.

233
00:12:37,017 --> 00:12:38,496
61, stay with your vehicle.

234
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:41,412
We're bringing a victim to you,
a young boy.

235
00:12:41,456 --> 00:12:43,980
Get him far away from here.

236
00:12:44,024 --> 00:12:45,590
Okay.

237
00:12:45,634 --> 00:12:48,811
Carver, you go with them
so you can fill in the details.

238
00:12:48,855 --> 00:12:49,812
We'll follow you to Med.

239
00:12:49,856 --> 00:12:51,212
Copy that.

240
00:12:51,553 --> 00:12:52,641
What are we looking at?

241
00:12:52,684 --> 00:12:53,816
GSW to the head.

242
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,209
Entry wound, but no exit.

243
00:12:55,252 --> 00:12:56,651
Let's get him on the stretcher.

244
00:13:05,741 --> 00:13:06,829
What's your name, hon?

245
00:13:06,873 --> 00:13:08,657
- Tyler.
- How old are you?

246
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,355
- Eight.
- Give my fingers a squeeze.

247
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:13,276
Okay. Good.

248
00:13:14,358 --> 00:13:15,751
- GSW?
- Yeah.

249
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:16,708
The bullet ricocheted through a wall,

250
00:13:16,752 --> 00:13:18,188
so maybe it's not too deep.

251
00:13:18,232 --> 00:13:20,843
But he's been conscious
and aware the whole time.

252
00:13:21,406 --> 00:13:22,497
And brave as hell.

253
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,977
Okay.

254
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:24,978
The doctors are gonna take care of you.

255
00:13:25,021 --> 00:13:27,004
- I have to blow my nose.
- I don't know if now's a good time.

256
00:13:27,048 --> 00:13:28,658
Please, I really have to blow my nose.

257
00:13:28,702 --> 00:13:31,288
Tyler, you just sit there
and do what she says, okay?

258
00:13:31,332 --> 00:13:32,986
Okay, let me have a look,
just see if I...

259
00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:34,030
can you grab me the pen light?
Thank you.

260
00:13:34,074 --> 00:13:36,337
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay. Lean back.

261
00:13:41,255 --> 00:13:42,604
Wait a second.

262
00:13:42,647 --> 00:13:43,866
Don't move.

263
00:13:46,913 --> 00:13:48,784
Okay. Hold still.

264
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:53,528
Oh, that feels so much better.

265
00:13:53,571 --> 00:13:55,193
Wow.

266
00:13:55,922 --> 00:13:57,654
It's incredible.

267
00:13:58,402 --> 00:14:01,188
Tyler, you and your mom
should buy a lottery ticket

268
00:14:01,231 --> 00:14:03,284
because you're one lucky kid.

269
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:05,322
Seriously.

270
00:14:19,249 --> 00:14:21,034
- Oh, my God, what is that?
- What? What?

271
00:14:23,036 --> 00:14:25,837
He fell down!

272
00:14:28,258 --> 00:14:29,607
Capp, what the hell are you doing?

273
00:14:29,651 --> 00:14:30,870
You wanna break the couch again?

274
00:14:30,913 --> 00:14:33,655
I'm sorry, Cruz, they got me good.

275
00:14:33,698 --> 00:14:35,309
I had nothing to do with it.

276
00:14:36,788 --> 00:14:38,486
Cruz.

277
00:14:38,529 --> 00:14:39,748
Sorry, Chief.

278
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,750
I told them to knock it off.

279
00:14:41,793 --> 00:14:43,665
Okay, um...

280
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:45,623
your fire report from last shift.

281
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:47,843
It got bounced back by HQ.

282
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,279
Really? How come?

283
00:14:49,323 --> 00:14:51,791
You didn't follow the format.

284
00:14:52,195 --> 00:14:54,381
It's okay. Just, um,

285
00:14:54,982 --> 00:14:56,417
make the corrections, resubmit.

286
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,158
Ask Kidd or Hermann
to walk you through it.

287
00:14:58,201 --> 00:14:59,942
- Will do.
- Okay.

288
00:14:59,986 --> 00:15:01,378
Sorry about that, Chief.

289
00:15:04,729 --> 00:15:05,948
When those bullets were flying,

290
00:15:05,992 --> 00:15:08,168
it felt like we were
in the middle of a movie.

291
00:15:08,211 --> 00:15:11,301
It wasn't even real. It was crazy.

292
00:15:11,345 --> 00:15:12,476
I mean, we're lucky to be alive.

293
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,913
- All of us.
- Mm-hmm.

294
00:15:13,956 --> 00:15:15,262
And for what?

295
00:15:15,305 --> 00:15:17,025
A turf war.

296
00:15:17,655 --> 00:15:19,048
Tragic, you know?

297
00:15:19,092 --> 00:15:20,876
No doubt about that.

298
00:15:22,834 --> 00:15:24,271
You guys okay?

299
00:15:24,314 --> 00:15:25,881
- That was no joke.
- Yeah.

300
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,927
We were just saying
we're lucky to be alive.

301
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:29,319
Mm.

302
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,107
Yeah, when we came out of the building,

303
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:36,326
that boy had an iron grip on your coat.

304
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:38,633
Seems like he got pretty attached.

305
00:15:38,676 --> 00:15:40,069
Tyler, yeah.

306
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:42,985
Brave little kid.

307
00:15:43,029 --> 00:15:44,465
I don't know what you said to him

308
00:15:44,508 --> 00:15:48,056
when you guys hit the ground,
but worked like magic.

309
00:15:48,765 --> 00:15:50,819
I'm gonna go check on the
medics, see if they're back.

310
00:15:50,862 --> 00:15:52,647
Mm-hmm.

311
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,651
So you got a gift with kids, huh?

312
00:15:56,694 --> 00:15:58,274
Hmm.

313
00:15:58,696 --> 00:15:59,917
I don't know about that.

314
00:15:59,961 --> 00:16:03,310
Well, you made a real
connection with Tyler,

315
00:16:03,353 --> 00:16:04,530
that's for sure.

316
00:16:07,488 --> 00:16:10,795
No child should have
to be scared like that.

317
00:16:10,995 --> 00:16:12,413
Ever.

318
00:16:18,542 --> 00:16:19,979
I'm just glad he's okay.

319
00:16:20,368 --> 00:16:21,543
At least for now.

320
00:16:27,504 --> 00:16:29,292
Hey, is that kid really okay?

321
00:16:29,336 --> 00:16:31,599
- I can't believe it.
- It's crazy. He's fine.

322
00:16:31,642 --> 00:16:33,514
The bullet skirted
the outside of his skull

323
00:16:33,557 --> 00:16:35,385
and wound up in his sinus cavity.

324
00:16:35,429 --> 00:16:37,518
They did a CAT scan.
There's no real damage.

325
00:16:37,561 --> 00:16:39,824
That's more than a miracle.
That's a higher power at work.

326
00:16:39,868 --> 00:16:41,957
I've never seen anything like it.

327
00:16:43,611 --> 00:16:47,441
Uh, I don't want it
to be weird between us.

328
00:16:47,484 --> 00:16:48,703
Neither do I.

329
00:16:48,746 --> 00:16:50,183
Like, I'm...
I shouldn't have said anything

330
00:16:50,226 --> 00:16:51,793
about my feelings the other day.

331
00:16:51,836 --> 00:16:53,882
It... it's not like it's a
huge issue for me, it's just...

332
00:16:53,925 --> 00:16:55,331
You don't have to explain yourself.

333
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,028
We had a thing, and there's

334
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:02,452
always been some
of that thing still there.

335
00:17:02,495 --> 00:17:05,720
But, um, by now,
we've learned we're better

336
00:17:05,762 --> 00:17:09,550
when we ignore that thing
and are just friends, you know?

337
00:17:09,593 --> 00:17:11,508
Yeah, yeah, I do.

338
00:17:14,511 --> 00:17:16,905
I couldn't have made it
the last few months

339
00:17:16,948 --> 00:17:23,215
without the friendship part,
so I'm never letting it go.

340
00:17:23,712 --> 00:17:25,194
That's good by me.

341
00:17:28,682 --> 00:17:31,250
Getting caught in that kind of crossfire

342
00:17:31,294 --> 00:17:32,665
sounds terrifying.

343
00:17:32,709 --> 00:17:35,036
It was, but we handled it.

344
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,516
Lieutenant Kidd is who handled it.

345
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,431
Took down a bunch of gangbangers,

346
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:40,738
gave us a chance
to get that kid out of there.

347
00:17:40,781 --> 00:17:42,211
Team effort.

348
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,481
I'm just glad you're all safe.

349
00:17:44,524 --> 00:17:47,651
If you need to talk to peer
support, you let me know.

350
00:17:47,676 --> 00:17:49,468
Absolutely, Chief.

351
00:17:54,012 --> 00:17:56,449
- Hey, Seager.
- Hey, guys.

352
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:58,811
Final report on that stable fire.

353
00:17:59,322 --> 00:18:01,898
I'm bringing it, uh, to Boden.

354
00:18:04,936 --> 00:18:07,460
Great to see you, as always.

355
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,117
I heard you guys had a rough one.

356
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,336
It was, yeah,

357
00:18:13,379 --> 00:18:15,599
but the victim's doing good, so.

358
00:18:15,642 --> 00:18:18,297
Well, maybe we can grab a drink later

359
00:18:18,341 --> 00:18:19,864
and you can fill me in?

360
00:18:19,907 --> 00:18:21,344
I'd love that.

361
00:18:21,387 --> 00:18:24,921
And then I can make you
forget all about it.

362
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:27,798
That sounds even better.

363
00:18:37,447 --> 00:18:39,797
Hey. What are you doing in here?

364
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,581
I'm drinking tea.

365
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:42,756
Why?

366
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,193
Well, tea is supposed to relax you,

367
00:18:45,237 --> 00:18:47,848
and after that call, I need it.

368
00:18:47,892 --> 00:18:50,373
Why are you drinking it in here?

369
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:53,463
Ah, I wanted a little peace and quiet.

370
00:18:53,506 --> 00:18:57,989
Eh, well, sorry to interrupt,
but I could, you know,

371
00:18:58,032 --> 00:18:59,872
use your help.

372
00:19:00,383 --> 00:19:02,689
I wanted to have a party for Cindy

373
00:19:02,733 --> 00:19:05,083
to celebrate her last round
of chemo, you know.

374
00:19:05,126 --> 00:19:07,215
I think it would be good for
her mental health, you know,

375
00:19:07,259 --> 00:19:09,261
to feel something good about, you know?

376
00:19:09,305 --> 00:19:10,654
That makes sense.

377
00:19:10,697 --> 00:19:11,972
But she's...

378
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,746
You know, she's feeling
really self-conscious

379
00:19:15,789 --> 00:19:17,356
about the way she looks these days,

380
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,140
and she doesn't wanna do it.

381
00:19:19,184 --> 00:19:20,685
Huh.

382
00:19:21,317 --> 00:19:25,756
And there's only
one person that I know of

383
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:30,587
that could convince anybody
to do anything.

384
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:31,544
Who?

385
00:19:33,938 --> 00:19:36,288
Ah.

386
00:19:47,255 --> 00:19:50,694
Hey, uh, oh, um,

387
00:19:50,737 --> 00:19:52,130
Chief said that I could use this office.

388
00:19:52,173 --> 00:19:55,220
It's just there's so much paperwork.

389
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:57,309
Of course. You should.

390
00:19:57,353 --> 00:19:58,876
Yeah.

391
00:20:00,573 --> 00:20:04,882
Funny, I actually
came in here on instinct.

392
00:20:04,925 --> 00:20:08,059
That's what I always do
when there's a rough call

393
00:20:08,102 --> 00:20:11,277
or I just need to talk.

394
00:20:14,326 --> 00:20:15,823
You can talk to me, if you want.

395
00:20:17,764 --> 00:20:22,595
I know there's no comparison,
but come on in.

396
00:20:25,206 --> 00:20:27,165
Gallo was telling us about that call.

397
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:28,949
That sounds like something.

398
00:20:36,217 --> 00:20:37,784
I really miss him.

399
00:20:40,961 --> 00:20:41,962
I bet.

400
00:20:45,313 --> 00:20:47,446
I know it's partly because

401
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:50,667
I didn't have time to prepare, you know?

402
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,973
The slot came up so suddenly.

403
00:20:53,017 --> 00:20:54,279
Yeah.

404
00:20:54,322 --> 00:20:57,587
It feels like he just disappeared.

405
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:00,546
I think it shook everybody up
a little, me included.

406
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:03,454
He really jumped at the chance.

407
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:09,163
And I don't know why, honestly,

408
00:21:09,207 --> 00:21:12,515
because I always thought
that arson was his side gig.

409
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:15,213
Now suddenly, it's center stage.

410
00:21:15,256 --> 00:21:18,129
It's still a great
experience, no matter what.

411
00:21:18,172 --> 00:21:19,804
It is.

412
00:21:21,219 --> 00:21:22,612
And I did this last year.

413
00:21:22,655 --> 00:21:25,963
I went away, got wrapped up
in Girls on Fire,

414
00:21:26,006 --> 00:21:29,532
and got a little distant, so I get it.

415
00:21:29,575 --> 00:21:31,838
Throwing yourself
into a project for a while

416
00:21:31,882 --> 00:21:33,361
can be great.

417
00:21:36,147 --> 00:21:38,531
I just hope I'm not missing something...

418
00:21:41,282 --> 00:21:48,040
that there's not something
more serious going on.

419
00:21:48,376 --> 00:21:49,334
That's all.

420
00:22:02,805 --> 00:22:04,784
So the weirdness
between Violet and Gallo

421
00:22:04,828 --> 00:22:05,959
seems to have died down.

422
00:22:06,003 --> 00:22:07,526
Do not jinx it by saying that.

423
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:08,658
Oh, who are we kidding?

424
00:22:08,701 --> 00:22:09,963
No matter what we say or do,

425
00:22:10,007 --> 00:22:11,791
that weirdness is gonna
come and go forever.

426
00:22:11,835 --> 00:22:14,275
I won't survive it, I'm telling you.

427
00:22:15,151 --> 00:22:16,622
Lieutenant.

428
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:17,860
Hey.

429
00:22:17,904 --> 00:22:21,061
Sorry I... I laid out
that on you yesterday.

430
00:22:21,105 --> 00:22:24,891
I think the call hit me
harder than I realized.

431
00:22:24,935 --> 00:22:27,590
I am sure everything's fine with Kelly.

432
00:22:27,633 --> 00:22:29,417
It's really no problem.

433
00:22:29,461 --> 00:22:30,636
I'm here any time.

434
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,637
Thanks, Cruz.

435
00:22:31,681 --> 00:22:32,856
You got it.

436
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:35,815
Hey, Lieutenant.

437
00:22:35,859 --> 00:22:37,251
Yeah?

438
00:22:37,295 --> 00:22:39,384
I just gotta say,
I've never seen two people

439
00:22:39,427 --> 00:22:41,552
more perfect for each other
than you and Severide.

440
00:22:45,129 --> 00:22:46,478
Besides you and Chloe.

441
00:22:46,522 --> 00:22:48,001
Well, duh.

442
00:22:48,045 --> 00:22:50,743
Uh, Cruz?

443
00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:53,790
Did Dubitsky in training
call you about certification?

444
00:22:54,134 --> 00:22:55,266
No.

445
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:56,836
Ah, damn.

446
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,534
He should have.

447
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:00,144
It turns out if you wanna keep
running Squad,

448
00:23:00,187 --> 00:23:02,538
you need your
Instructor II certification.

449
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:05,541
You need to report to the
academy right after shift.

450
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:08,282
As in now.

451
00:23:08,326 --> 00:23:10,023
Oh, but Javi's got a game today.

452
00:23:13,418 --> 00:23:16,116
I'll call Chloe. I'll let her know.

453
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,944
Really sorry about Dubitsky's screw-up.

454
00:23:17,988 --> 00:23:18,989
No sweat, Chief.

455
00:23:28,376 --> 00:23:29,808
Hey, I'm back.

456
00:23:30,957 --> 00:23:32,176
How's it going here?

457
00:23:32,219 --> 00:23:33,569
Making progress.

458
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:35,614
I'll have it framed out
by the end of the day.

459
00:23:35,658 --> 00:23:36,963
Fantastic.

460
00:23:37,007 --> 00:23:39,009
Say, is that your Bronco out front?

461
00:23:39,052 --> 00:23:40,488
Yeah. Is it in your way?

462
00:23:40,532 --> 00:23:43,013
No. I was admiring it, actually.

463
00:23:43,056 --> 00:23:44,492
Is that a '96?

464
00:23:44,536 --> 00:23:45,624
That's right.

465
00:23:45,668 --> 00:23:47,966
It's the last generation 5.8 liter V8.

466
00:23:49,241 --> 00:23:50,629
Well, she's a beaut.

467
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:53,763
Whoa, Ethan.

468
00:23:53,806 --> 00:23:55,068
Whoa, you gotta stay out of Sam's way

469
00:23:55,112 --> 00:23:56,548
or he'll never finish
the entertainment center.

470
00:23:56,592 --> 00:23:57,723
It's fine.

471
00:23:57,767 --> 00:23:58,942
He's been keeping a respectful distance.

472
00:23:58,985 --> 00:24:01,553
Oh, sorry, sorry.

473
00:24:01,597 --> 00:24:02,775
It's all good.

474
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:14,261
- I should get back to it.
- Yeah. Come on, Ethan.

475
00:24:14,305 --> 00:24:16,063
Let's stay out of Sam's hair.

476
00:24:16,786 --> 00:24:18,483
Mom!

477
00:24:28,275 --> 00:24:29,755
- Trudy.
- Hey.

478
00:24:29,799 --> 00:24:31,996
What are you doing here?

479
00:24:32,976 --> 00:24:35,587
I've been assigned to your case.

480
00:24:35,631 --> 00:24:36,762
My case?

481
00:24:36,806 --> 00:24:39,635
The chemo party you don't wanna have.

482
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:41,297
Oh.

483
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,464
I hear you're not
feeling at your sexiest.

484
00:24:43,508 --> 00:24:45,175
Uh, no.

485
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:47,077
Because I'm not.

486
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:51,255
And to be honest, you, Donna,
and a few other girlfriends

487
00:24:51,298 --> 00:24:53,039
are the only ones who've
seen me in this condition

488
00:24:53,083 --> 00:24:54,911
besides family.

489
00:24:54,954 --> 00:24:56,434
You know what you look like?

490
00:24:56,477 --> 00:24:59,002
A woman who's been through chemo,

491
00:24:59,045 --> 00:25:01,700
who deserves to celebrate the end of it.

492
00:25:01,744 --> 00:25:03,136
We don't know it's the end.

493
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,834
- That's part of the problem.
- Okay.

494
00:25:04,877 --> 00:25:06,487
But say it is.

495
00:25:06,531 --> 00:25:08,359
When else are you gonna have
the perfect chance

496
00:25:08,402 --> 00:25:11,971
to go hog wild with hair and
makeup, just change it all up?

497
00:25:12,015 --> 00:25:13,190
What?

498
00:25:13,233 --> 00:25:15,583
Oh, come on, honey, I love you,

499
00:25:15,627 --> 00:25:18,891
but we both know
you're not a big risk taker

500
00:25:18,935 --> 00:25:21,211
when it comes to your look.

501
00:25:21,764 --> 00:25:22,721
And you are?

502
00:25:22,765 --> 00:25:25,506
Uh, gray is bold.

503
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:28,074
And I got some bold ideas for you too.

504
00:25:28,118 --> 00:25:29,762
This is...

505
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:32,122
this is gonna get spicy.

506
00:25:49,966 --> 00:25:51,617
Damn.

507
00:25:52,577 --> 00:25:54,828
Looks like the distraction
was temporary.

508
00:25:56,537 --> 00:25:58,457
It was perfect, is what it was.

509
00:26:01,151 --> 00:26:03,719
I know this was an intense call,

510
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:07,374
but you've been a firefighter
for a while now.

511
00:26:07,418 --> 00:26:10,551
So what's sticking with you
about this one?

512
00:26:12,796 --> 00:26:14,765
I'm not really sure.

513
00:26:19,909 --> 00:26:22,147
Well...

514
00:26:22,868 --> 00:26:27,394
I consider it my civic duty

515
00:26:27,438 --> 00:26:30,397
to continue this distraction work

516
00:26:30,441 --> 00:26:32,573
on behalf of the
Chicago Fire Department.

517
00:26:34,488 --> 00:26:38,797
I don't know what the CFD
would do without you.

518
00:26:38,841 --> 00:26:41,017
Mm.

519
00:26:52,289 --> 00:26:54,726
The good news is,
Kidd said she's flying out

520
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:55,945
- to visit him next week.
- Oh, that's great.

521
00:26:55,988 --> 00:26:57,308
Phone calls only get you so far

522
00:26:57,351 --> 00:26:58,556
when you're trying to stay connected.

523
00:26:58,599 --> 00:26:59,557
Yeah.

524
00:27:04,431 --> 00:27:05,607
We need help.

525
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,525
Oh, wow.

526
00:27:11,569 --> 00:27:12,875
I'm a coach at Sarton Academy,

527
00:27:12,918 --> 00:27:14,398
just a few blocks away,
and we were getting ready

528
00:27:14,441 --> 00:27:15,616
for the game tomorrow.

529
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,531
It's humiliating.

530
00:27:17,575 --> 00:27:18,706
All right. Well, let's take a look.

531
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:19,838
Katy's not usually the mascot.

532
00:27:19,882 --> 00:27:21,535
She was just trying it on.

533
00:27:21,579 --> 00:27:25,061
- Yeah, that's pinned in tight.
- Yeah, let's get her inside.

534
00:27:25,104 --> 00:27:26,802
I pass by here every day
on the way to school.

535
00:27:26,845 --> 00:27:28,673
- I knew you guys could help.
- Smart move.

536
00:27:28,716 --> 00:27:29,935
Let's sit her down in the common room.

537
00:27:32,068 --> 00:27:34,070
Katy!

538
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:38,335
Oh, she's cyanotic.
Her oxygen must be tanking.

539
00:27:38,378 --> 00:27:40,206
- She's suffocating in there.
- Oh, my God.

540
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:42,121
Capp. Capp!

541
00:27:42,165 --> 00:27:43,775
Grab the tin snips, we have
a trapped victim in here.

542
00:27:43,819 --> 00:27:45,211
- Copy.
- I'll get the BVM.

543
00:27:45,255 --> 00:27:46,299
You got it.

544
00:27:48,258 --> 00:27:50,608
She's bradycardic, heart rate 50.

545
00:27:50,651 --> 00:27:52,044
All right, hold the mask steady.

546
00:27:52,088 --> 00:27:53,437
I'm gonna do release cuts on both sides.

547
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,907
You got it.

548
00:27:55,352 --> 00:27:57,267
Bag her, I'll put the
pulse ox and the leads on her.

549
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,827
You got it.

550
00:28:00,009 --> 00:28:01,077
Okay.

551
00:28:06,754 --> 00:28:08,452
- Okay. I'll pull it off.
- I got her.

552
00:28:08,495 --> 00:28:11,063
Ready? Easy.

553
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:15,154
Coming in.

554
00:28:15,198 --> 00:28:17,809
Hey. It's okay. They'll take care of it.

555
00:28:17,853 --> 00:28:19,640
Oh, come on, Katy.

556
00:28:20,681 --> 00:28:22,422
Tighten your seal.

557
00:28:22,466 --> 00:28:24,120
- Yep.
- Thanks.

558
00:28:27,601 --> 00:28:28,907
Heart rate's coming up.

559
00:28:28,951 --> 00:28:30,735
Oxygen levels in the 80s.

560
00:28:30,778 --> 00:28:33,390
- That's good.
- Oh, thank God.

561
00:28:36,741 --> 00:28:37,960
- Hey.
- Whoa.

562
00:28:38,003 --> 00:28:40,005
- You know where you are, Katy?
- Yeah.

563
00:28:40,049 --> 00:28:44,618
Coach Julia brought me here
to the firehouse.

564
00:28:44,662 --> 00:28:45,924
Ugh, stupid mask.

565
00:28:45,968 --> 00:28:47,404
- You feel okay?
- Yeah.

566
00:28:47,447 --> 00:28:48,796
Breathing and heart rate are normal,

567
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,928
but I wanna take her to Med

568
00:28:49,972 --> 00:28:50,973
to get her checked out just to be safe.

569
00:28:51,016 --> 00:28:52,365
I have a chem final today.

570
00:28:52,409 --> 00:28:53,758
I'm sure they'll let you retake it.

571
00:28:53,801 --> 00:28:55,891
Well, chem is my favorite subject,

572
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:57,849
so we'll have a lot
to talk about on the ride.

573
00:28:57,893 --> 00:29:00,417
Beware, she's obsessed.

574
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:02,593
Thank you for getting
that mask off so quick.

575
00:29:02,636 --> 00:29:04,900
- That was pretty awesome.
- We're just glad she's okay.

576
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:11,669
I wonder if I can fix this.

577
00:29:15,911 --> 00:29:18,323
- Hey.
- Hey.

578
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:22,134
I am gonna need your honest assessment.

579
00:29:22,178 --> 00:29:23,787
Of course.

580
00:29:24,528 --> 00:29:26,138
What about?

581
00:29:26,182 --> 00:29:29,141
When Severide took furlough and we knew

582
00:29:29,185 --> 00:29:31,535
that it wasn't gonna be a quick one,

583
00:29:31,578 --> 00:29:35,191
HQ pressured me into bringing
in a relief lieutenant.

584
00:29:35,234 --> 00:29:38,890
I argued for letting Cruz act up

585
00:29:38,934 --> 00:29:42,763
in the interest of continuity
and house morale.

586
00:29:42,807 --> 00:29:44,641
Makes perfect sense.

587
00:29:45,418 --> 00:29:47,377
Cruz doesn't seem to be enjoying

588
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:49,646
the added responsibility.

589
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:52,295
Squad is an elite unit.

590
00:29:52,338 --> 00:29:55,254
He's got very big shoes to fill.

591
00:29:55,298 --> 00:29:58,113
HQ is watching him like a hawk.

592
00:29:58,518 --> 00:30:00,303
That is a heavy burden

593
00:30:00,346 --> 00:30:01,869
to put on someone who didn't ask for it.

594
00:30:05,047 --> 00:30:06,613
So what are you thinking?

595
00:30:06,657 --> 00:30:10,008
Why not take the pressure
off, thank him for filling in,

596
00:30:10,052 --> 00:30:11,314
bring in a relief lieutenant,

597
00:30:11,357 --> 00:30:13,664
let Joe go back to doing
what Joe does best.

598
00:30:13,707 --> 00:30:19,975
Chief, whether Joe wanted
the job or not, he's in it now,

599
00:30:20,018 --> 00:30:23,152
and he needs to handle it on his terms.

600
00:30:23,195 --> 00:30:27,069
If it's snatched away from him,
you'll shake his confidence.

601
00:30:27,112 --> 00:30:28,727
He may never try again.

602
00:30:34,149 --> 00:30:35,773
Okay.

603
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:48,264
Hey. How you feeling?

604
00:30:48,307 --> 00:30:51,789
You know, same day-after crap as usual.

605
00:30:51,832 --> 00:30:53,335
But I'm okay.

606
00:30:54,966 --> 00:30:56,620
I'm sorry I don't wanna
do the party, honey.

607
00:30:56,663 --> 00:30:58,578
You don't got to apologize.

608
00:30:58,622 --> 00:31:00,102
I... I get it.

609
00:31:00,145 --> 00:31:01,973
Hey, you know, moving on.

610
00:31:02,017 --> 00:31:06,151
So we got doctors appointments
to set for next week.

611
00:31:06,195 --> 00:31:07,933
I'll get on that today.

612
00:31:08,458 --> 00:31:10,068
Okay. Sounds good.

613
00:31:10,112 --> 00:31:11,852
- Thanks.
- You bet.

614
00:31:11,896 --> 00:31:13,332
I'll see you tomorrow after shift.

615
00:31:19,904 --> 00:31:22,298
Mouch. Hey.

616
00:31:22,341 --> 00:31:24,474
Will you, um, tell Trudy thank you

617
00:31:24,517 --> 00:31:26,345
for talking to Cindy about the party?

618
00:31:26,389 --> 00:31:27,955
- I sure will.
- All right.

619
00:31:27,999 --> 00:31:30,610
I'm glad she tried, you know,
even if it didn't work out.

620
00:31:30,654 --> 00:31:33,352
Oh, I think it worked out.

621
00:31:40,272 --> 00:31:41,839
Robert.

622
00:31:41,882 --> 00:31:45,429
Hey, you really have taken
great care of this thing, Sam.

623
00:31:45,756 --> 00:31:47,975
I'm only the second owner.

624
00:31:48,019 --> 00:31:49,499
Are you ready to be the third?

625
00:31:49,542 --> 00:31:50,848
Hell yes, I am.

626
00:31:50,891 --> 00:31:51,936
You know, my dad and I go fishing

627
00:31:51,979 --> 00:31:53,546
down at Devil's Kitchen.

628
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:57,246
Gravel roads do not agree with my BMW.

629
00:31:57,289 --> 00:31:58,943
Here's that cashier's check.

630
00:32:02,599 --> 00:32:03,861
You got a pen?

631
00:32:22,967 --> 00:32:25,012
- Hey.
- Hey.

632
00:32:32,846 --> 00:32:34,718
Okay, guys, let's hustle.

633
00:32:34,761 --> 00:32:37,634
We got a chance to shave 15
seconds off of our last time.

634
00:32:37,677 --> 00:32:39,201
Nice work, Capp. There you go.

635
00:32:39,244 --> 00:32:41,681
Good job. Here we go, guys. Come on.

636
00:32:41,725 --> 00:32:42,856
Come on, don't slow down.

637
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,858
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

638
00:32:44,902 --> 00:32:46,208
Come on, boys.

639
00:32:46,251 --> 00:32:47,557
Come on.

640
00:32:51,778 --> 00:32:52,953
And through.

641
00:32:56,609 --> 00:32:59,003
Good effort, guys. Really good effort.

642
00:32:59,046 --> 00:33:01,048
Let's, uh, let's put the dummy back.

643
00:33:01,092 --> 00:33:02,464
We'll try it again.

644
00:33:02,876 --> 00:33:04,574
You like how he says "we"?

645
00:33:04,617 --> 00:33:06,619
I vote we take a break.

646
00:33:06,663 --> 00:33:08,099
Vote?

647
00:33:08,143 --> 00:33:10,145
Well, what do you think this is?

648
00:33:12,016 --> 00:33:14,236
Look, okay, guys.

649
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:15,933
I know that this is a pain in the ass,

650
00:33:15,976 --> 00:33:18,283
but we gotta buff up the teamwork.

651
00:33:18,327 --> 00:33:19,676
We got a change in personnel.

652
00:33:19,719 --> 00:33:21,156
We gotta make sure that
the gears are meshing.

653
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:23,375
Yeah, good luck meshing
with Mutt and Jeff here

654
00:33:23,419 --> 00:33:24,463
pulling in two different directions.

655
00:33:24,507 --> 00:33:25,464
What?

656
00:33:31,253 --> 00:33:32,558
He's a bad fit, Joe.

657
00:33:32,602 --> 00:33:33,864
I didn't pick him.

658
00:33:33,907 --> 00:33:35,126
Well, you need to set him straight.

659
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:37,259
And you... you're not helping matters,

660
00:33:37,302 --> 00:33:38,608
laughing at his jokes all the time.

661
00:33:38,651 --> 00:33:40,871
- Oh, this is my fault now?
- Hey.

662
00:33:40,914 --> 00:33:42,671
I'm taking a water break.

663
00:33:43,308 --> 00:33:44,962
No wonder Severide
hightailed it out of here.

664
00:33:53,362 --> 00:33:54,580
Cruz.

665
00:33:54,624 --> 00:33:56,016
Your guys are out there waiting for you.

666
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:58,018
Yeah, let them wait!

667
00:33:58,062 --> 00:34:00,438
Whoa. Hey.

668
00:34:01,326 --> 00:34:03,150
What's the matter?

669
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,943
I can't do it.

670
00:34:04,968 --> 00:34:08,885
I haven't slept in a week
from the stress of all of this.

671
00:34:09,378 --> 00:34:12,381
You... you come back from
nearly being shot to death,

672
00:34:12,423 --> 00:34:14,034
and everything is fine.

673
00:34:14,077 --> 00:34:16,079
Meanwhile, my whole company
is falling apart

674
00:34:16,123 --> 00:34:17,747
because I can't handle one joker.

675
00:34:20,394 --> 00:34:21,693
I'm no Severide.

676
00:34:21,738 --> 00:34:23,043
I never will be.

677
00:34:23,086 --> 00:34:25,350
I don't know who the hell
I thought I was kidding.

678
00:34:32,965 --> 00:34:33,835
Sit.

679
00:34:42,106 --> 00:34:44,858
You ever heard of imposter syndrome?

680
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,765
It's when you're afraid that everyone

681
00:34:48,807 --> 00:34:50,896
is gonna find out that you're a fraud

682
00:34:50,941 --> 00:34:54,292
when, in fact, you are not.

683
00:34:55,988 --> 00:34:57,996
What's it called when you really are?

684
00:34:59,993 --> 00:35:02,083
Your job is not to be Severide.

685
00:35:04,346 --> 00:35:07,214
Your job is to be yourself.

686
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:15,313
This is what Kelly
texted me when he heard

687
00:35:15,357 --> 00:35:18,403
that Boden was keeping you on
as acting lieutenant.

688
00:35:18,447 --> 00:35:19,622
"That's great.

689
00:35:19,665 --> 00:35:22,233
"Joe is the best man for that job,

690
00:35:22,277 --> 00:35:25,758
not just smart and competent,
but tough as they come."

691
00:35:30,134 --> 00:35:33,572
So, you tell me.

692
00:35:34,811 --> 00:35:36,769
Does he have it wrong?

693
00:35:37,944 --> 00:35:41,687
Is Kelly Severide
a poor judge of character?

694
00:35:48,564 --> 00:35:53,046
I had plenty of self-doubt
when I became lieutenant too.

695
00:35:54,787 --> 00:35:58,487
So I speak from experience when I say,

696
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:00,315
don't second-guess yourself, Cruz.

697
00:36:02,665 --> 00:36:05,189
Because nobody else second guesses you.

698
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:11,069
Yeah, I don't think
Bamford got that memo.

699
00:36:12,109 --> 00:36:16,069
Then make sure to give it to him.

700
00:36:41,268 --> 00:36:42,726
Yeah.

701
00:36:43,532 --> 00:36:46,796
Hey, what are you doing here?

702
00:36:46,839 --> 00:36:48,523
How's Tyler?

703
00:36:49,146 --> 00:36:51,148
He's real good.

704
00:36:51,191 --> 00:36:53,890
He's in a bath, but he'll
definitely wanna see you,

705
00:36:53,933 --> 00:36:55,674
so come on in. I'll rush him along.

706
00:36:55,718 --> 00:36:57,067
No, I can't stay.

707
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:58,491
I just wanted to bring you something.

708
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,640
Ariel, you guys have to get out
of this neighborhood.

709
00:37:07,251 --> 00:37:08,774
It's not enough
to solve all your problems,

710
00:37:08,818 --> 00:37:10,689
I know, but it should cover
first and last month's rent,

711
00:37:10,733 --> 00:37:12,561
security deposit, maybe a little extra.

712
00:37:12,604 --> 00:37:13,823
Where'd this come from?

713
00:37:13,866 --> 00:37:14,824
I... I can't take this.

714
00:37:14,867 --> 00:37:16,509
Could it help you?

715
00:37:17,043 --> 00:37:19,346
Could get you away from all this?

716
00:37:22,404 --> 00:37:24,536
- Of course, but...
- Then take it.

717
00:37:26,966 --> 00:37:28,925
I wish somebody had gotten me
out of my bad situation

718
00:37:28,968 --> 00:37:30,565
when I was his age.

719
00:37:31,569 --> 00:37:34,920
So please, let me do this for him.

720
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:41,328
I...

721
00:37:41,372 --> 00:37:42,952
I'm going to pay you back.

722
00:37:45,985 --> 00:37:47,944
If you want. But take your time.

723
00:37:47,987 --> 00:37:50,168
I'll just blow the money
on bad decisions, anyway.

724
00:37:53,645 --> 00:37:55,212
Good luck.

725
00:38:06,433 --> 00:38:08,783
Okay. I'm here.

726
00:38:08,808 --> 00:38:10,688
Have a seat, Bamford.

727
00:38:11,881 --> 00:38:13,970
Appreciate it. Thanks.

728
00:38:14,013 --> 00:38:15,944
What's the occasion?

729
00:38:16,581 --> 00:38:19,715
I can't have you smack
talking Capp and Tony anymore.

730
00:38:19,758 --> 00:38:21,281
It's called ball busting, Cruz.

731
00:38:21,325 --> 00:38:22,979
You do know you work
in a firehouse, right?

732
00:38:23,022 --> 00:38:25,590
Not just any firehouse.

733
00:38:25,634 --> 00:38:27,374
51.

734
00:38:27,418 --> 00:38:29,333
Look, jokes are fine.

735
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:32,961
Pranks, gallows humor, blowing
off some steam, it's all good.

736
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:36,471
But we don't knock each other
down here in the process.

737
00:38:36,514 --> 00:38:38,133
We lift each other up.

738
00:38:38,734 --> 00:38:41,344
So you're gonna have to try and
do it our way while you're here.

739
00:38:42,128 --> 00:38:43,260
Got it?

740
00:38:47,438 --> 00:38:48,810
Okay.

741
00:38:49,571 --> 00:38:51,137
I can do that.

742
00:38:51,181 --> 00:38:52,399
Good.

743
00:38:55,251 --> 00:38:56,992
Look at this.

744
00:38:57,143 --> 00:38:59,494
Oh, she had heart eyes
for him from the jump.

745
00:38:59,537 --> 00:39:01,072
Aw.

746
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,908
They actually make
kind of a cute couple.

747
00:39:04,673 --> 00:39:06,544
What? They do.

748
00:39:06,588 --> 00:39:07,589
Hey there.

749
00:39:07,632 --> 00:39:10,026
- Hi.
- Is Carver here yet?

750
00:39:10,069 --> 00:39:12,028
Haven't seen him. What can I get you?

751
00:39:12,071 --> 00:39:14,204
I'll take a Manhattan, please.

752
00:39:14,247 --> 00:39:15,837
You got it.

753
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:18,173
So how's that going?

754
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:21,559
Is... is that a thing, you two?

755
00:39:21,603 --> 00:39:22,952
Overstepping, Violet.

756
00:39:22,995 --> 00:39:25,280
It's fine.

757
00:39:25,324 --> 00:39:26,907
We're very casual.

758
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:29,349
Um, I mean, he's not
a settle down kind of guy,

759
00:39:29,393 --> 00:39:32,265
and I'm not a settle down kind of girl.

760
00:39:32,309 --> 00:39:34,606
But if I was,

761
00:39:35,138 --> 00:39:37,233
I wouldn't let him get very far.

762
00:39:39,185 --> 00:39:40,578
Mm.

763
00:39:40,622 --> 00:39:42,580
This is great. Thanks.

764
00:39:42,624 --> 00:39:45,583
So what's the latest
with our friend Severide?

765
00:39:45,627 --> 00:39:47,324
Speaking of very far.

766
00:39:47,367 --> 00:39:50,806
Oh, I didn't mean it that way.

767
00:39:50,849 --> 00:39:52,416
I'm gonna see him next weekend,

768
00:39:52,459 --> 00:39:54,331
might just drag him back home with me

769
00:39:54,374 --> 00:39:57,595
because I am not handling this so well.

770
00:39:57,639 --> 00:39:59,756
Mm, do it.

771
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:15,396
They had a dress up date.

772
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:19,399
She looks so... happy.

773
00:40:19,443 --> 00:40:23,099
Does anybody wanna buy
a couple of hotties a drink?

774
00:40:23,142 --> 00:40:25,405
It would be my privilege.

775
00:40:27,669 --> 00:40:30,585
You look beautiful.

776
00:40:30,628 --> 00:40:35,285
Ah, it's just silliness, but we had fun.

777
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:36,852
Hey.

778
00:40:36,895 --> 00:40:42,118
That's all I want, you know,
for you to feel good again.

779
00:40:42,161 --> 00:40:43,946
Maybe that party was a stupid idea.

780
00:40:43,989 --> 00:40:47,303
No, it wasn't.

781
00:40:48,211 --> 00:40:50,431
We're gonna do a party,

782
00:40:50,779 --> 00:40:52,084
but it'll be when we get the news

783
00:40:52,128 --> 00:40:54,561
that all this is really over.

784
00:40:54,957 --> 00:40:58,525
Because that is going to happen.

785
00:40:58,569 --> 00:41:00,353
I believe that.

786
00:41:03,095 --> 00:41:08,492
I love you something awful,
redheaded lady.

787
00:41:08,535 --> 00:41:10,668
I know.
