1
00:00:04,526 --> 00:00:06,615
My aunt,

2
00:00:06,658 --> 00:00:08,921
out of nowhere, after all these years,

3
00:00:08,965 --> 00:00:10,314
wants to make nice.

4
00:00:10,358 --> 00:00:12,316
I thought his family wasn't around.

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,405
When he was a kid, there was a fire.

6
00:00:14,449 --> 00:00:16,015
They were able to pull him out,

7
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:18,322
but Mom, Dad, little sister...

8
00:00:18,366 --> 00:00:20,324
He lost them all.

9
00:00:20,368 --> 00:00:21,630
Why are you here?

10
00:00:21,673 --> 00:00:24,589
I have been clean for a few months now.

11
00:00:24,633 --> 00:00:25,764
You disappeared.

12
00:00:25,808 --> 00:00:27,244
I was 23.

13
00:00:27,288 --> 00:00:28,637
- I was a kid.
- No!

14
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,900
No, I was a kid!

15
00:00:30,943 --> 00:00:32,380
My aunt's at a bar in Logan Square.

16
00:00:32,423 --> 00:00:33,250
Damn it.

17
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:41,954
Lacey, it's Blake.

18
00:00:41,998 --> 00:00:43,565
It's Blake. Can you hear me?

19
00:00:54,228 --> 00:00:56,404
Hey! Hey, you two, help him out!

20
00:00:56,447 --> 00:00:57,535
Come on!

21
00:01:04,412 --> 00:01:05,587
Come on.

22
00:01:07,415 --> 00:01:09,721
- Screw this!
- Hey, don't let him leave!

23
00:01:09,765 --> 00:01:12,115
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hey, you gotta sit down.

24
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,727
Hey, Lacey. Lacey, stay with me.

25
00:01:17,555 --> 00:01:19,122
OK.

26
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:21,081
Lacey.

27
00:01:21,124 --> 00:01:24,026
Lacey, it's Blake.

28
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,129
Lacey.

29
00:01:26,173 --> 00:01:27,739
Lacey.

30
00:01:27,783 --> 00:01:28,740
Come on!

31
00:01:28,783 --> 00:01:29,907
Over here! Come on!

32
00:01:31,569 --> 00:01:33,049
Obvious fracture, left arm.

33
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,095
She's unresponsive with
lacerations to the forehead.

34
00:01:35,138 --> 00:01:36,400
Pulse is weak and rapid.

35
00:01:36,444 --> 00:01:37,532
- You a doctor?
- Firefighter.

36
00:01:37,575 --> 00:01:39,011
You better roll an engine out here.

37
00:01:39,055 --> 00:01:41,144
76 to Main, we need an engine.

38
00:01:41,188 --> 00:01:43,015
- Copy, 76.
- Okay. Okay, we got it.

39
00:01:43,059 --> 00:01:44,408
Let's go!

40
00:01:44,452 --> 00:01:46,106
Give me that blanket.

41
00:01:53,634 --> 00:01:55,680
I got her.

42
00:01:55,723 --> 00:01:56,899
All right, on me.

43
00:01:56,942 --> 00:01:58,852
One, two, three.

44
00:02:01,817 --> 00:02:03,035
All right, I got this. I got this.

45
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:04,820
- You get ready to go.
- Copy.

46
00:02:12,044 --> 00:02:13,176
Thanks. We got it from here.

47
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,047
No, I'm coming with. She's my aunt.

48
00:02:15,091 --> 00:02:16,353
Thank you.

49
00:02:21,445 --> 00:02:22,881
- Run the fluids wide.
- Copy.

50
00:02:22,925 --> 00:02:24,231
Any medical history I should know about?

51
00:02:24,274 --> 00:02:26,363
- Allergic to anything?
- I'm not sure.

52
00:02:26,407 --> 00:02:28,452
Is she on any medications?

53
00:02:28,496 --> 00:02:30,150
Not that I know of.

54
00:02:30,193 --> 00:02:31,281
She's been drinking.

55
00:02:31,325 --> 00:02:32,886
Yeah, I picked up on that.

56
00:02:38,723 --> 00:02:40,377
- Who do we have here?
- 40-year-old female.

57
00:02:40,421 --> 00:02:42,466
MVA with head trauma.
Obvious fracture, left arm.

58
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:43,772
Her name is Lacey Hoffman.

59
00:02:43,815 --> 00:02:45,295
Nephew, CFD. Found her on the scene.

60
00:02:45,339 --> 00:02:46,817
Let's get her in trauma three.

61
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,867
On me. One, two, three.

62
00:02:54,043 --> 00:02:55,740
Check her vitals, please.

63
00:02:55,784 --> 00:02:57,307
OK, you got it.

64
00:03:02,921 --> 00:03:04,706
Come on.

65
00:03:07,056 --> 00:03:12,975

66
00:03:14,792 --> 00:03:16,481
He is so concerned about his aunt

67
00:03:16,505 --> 00:03:18,246
that he forgot that he left his car

68
00:03:18,289 --> 00:03:19,987
on the side of the road
with the keys in it.

69
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:22,424
I don't think he forgot.
He just didn't care.

70
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:23,512
He wasn't gonna leave the hospital

71
00:03:23,556 --> 00:03:24,903
until his aunt was out of surgery.

72
00:03:24,946 --> 00:03:27,429
- But she's gonna be OK?
- I don't know.

73
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:29,518
He left when she was still sedated.

74
00:03:29,562 --> 00:03:31,433
I hope he gets some rest too, poor guy.

75
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:32,782
Oh, he won't.

76
00:03:32,826 --> 00:03:35,394
He insisted on coming into shift.

77
00:03:35,437 --> 00:03:38,035
I'm sure he needs a distraction.

78
00:03:54,311 --> 00:03:55,282
You good?

79
00:03:55,326 --> 00:03:57,590
Yeah, I'm just spacing out.

80
00:03:57,633 --> 00:04:00,114
I heard about your aunt.
Is she gonna be OK?

81
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:03,030
She was stable last
I checked, so that's good.

82
00:04:03,073 --> 00:04:04,379
Was she the one behind the wheel?

83
00:04:04,423 --> 00:04:07,077
No, some random
who picked her up at the bar.

84
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:08,688
The guy had a suspended license,

85
00:04:08,731 --> 00:04:11,255
blood alcohol level
twice the legal limit.

86
00:04:11,299 --> 00:04:12,605
Walks away with cuts and bruises.

87
00:04:12,648 --> 00:04:15,303
Always the ones at fault
who don't get hurt.

88
00:04:16,826 --> 00:04:18,975
I was pretty angry with her
the last time we spoke.

89
00:04:19,017 --> 00:04:21,036
I shouldn't have said what I said.

90
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:22,597
Why not?

91
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:28,023
You think this is on you?
Her falling off the wagon?

92
00:04:28,066 --> 00:04:30,100
She was doing pretty good
up to that point.

93
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:32,755
She's perfectly capable
of screwing up her life

94
00:04:32,799 --> 00:04:33,974
without any help from you.

95
00:04:34,017 --> 00:04:36,063
- She's proven that much.
- Mm.

96
00:04:36,106 --> 00:04:38,762
You had every right
to say what you said.

97
00:04:46,726 --> 00:04:47,901
Dylan?

98
00:04:47,944 --> 00:04:49,729
What are you doing here?

99
00:04:49,772 --> 00:04:50,817
I'm in trouble.

100
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,471
- Uh-oh.
- Yeah.

101
00:04:52,514 --> 00:04:54,255
And my mother always said,
if I'm in trouble,

102
00:04:54,298 --> 00:04:56,083
run down to the firehouse
and ask for help.

103
00:04:56,488 --> 00:04:58,302
Sounds serious. Are you hurt?

104
00:04:58,346 --> 00:04:59,913
OK, if you guys are
about to play doctor,

105
00:04:59,956 --> 00:05:01,697
please leave me out of it.

106
00:05:01,741 --> 00:05:04,918
As fun as that sounds,
here's the actual thing.

107
00:05:04,961 --> 00:05:08,356
My brother is making me
ditch all my responsibilities

108
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:09,749
and go to Vegas for the weekend.

109
00:05:09,792 --> 00:05:11,272
Oh, "making" you.

110
00:05:11,315 --> 00:05:13,056
He's my big brother.
That's how it works, you know?

111
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,363
Of course. So what do you need?

112
00:05:15,406 --> 00:05:17,452
You want me to run your bar
for a couple of days?

113
00:05:17,496 --> 00:05:19,236
Play left wing on your rec league?

114
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,543
No, way more fun.
You're gonna love this.

115
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:25,416
I'm booked to do a magic show
at the hospital on Saturday.

116
00:05:26,017 --> 00:05:28,419
And you want me to cancel it for you?

117
00:05:28,463 --> 00:05:30,944
No, I need you to be my understudy.

118
00:05:30,987 --> 00:05:32,423
Oh, that's bad idea.

119
00:05:32,467 --> 00:05:33,686
Oh, come on. You'd be great at it.

120
00:05:33,729 --> 00:05:34,817
The kids love you.

121
00:05:34,861 --> 00:05:36,340
I'm not a magician.

122
00:05:36,384 --> 00:05:38,560
Neither am I. Look.

123
00:05:41,171 --> 00:05:42,608
Oh, you came prepared.

124
00:05:42,651 --> 00:05:44,610
Everything you need
to be a magician is in here.

125
00:05:44,653 --> 00:05:48,396
You have instruction books,
props, flash paper,

126
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:51,312
- silk streamers, top hat.
- Oh.

127
00:05:51,355 --> 00:05:52,835
Dylan, I don't know.

128
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:54,315
Why not?

129
00:05:54,358 --> 00:05:56,056
You already know
how all the tricks work.

130
00:05:56,099 --> 00:05:58,232
I mean, if I can do it, you sure can.

131
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,756
You perform actual miracles
every day on the job.

132
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,758
Come on. What do you say?

133
00:06:03,933 --> 00:06:07,371
Sylvie, it's for the children.

134
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,637
- Oh, fine.
- OK.

135
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,029
Great.

136
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:14,596
You're not gonna regret this.

137
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,641
Once you get a taste of the limelight...

138
00:06:16,946 --> 00:06:18,208
Ambo 61. Squad 3.

139
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:19,732
I'll leave all this here for you.

140
00:06:19,775 --> 00:06:21,124
- You're gonna kill this.
- Truck 81. Structure fire.

141
00:06:21,168 --> 00:06:23,605
2958 West Pershing Road.

142
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:49,109
- That smoke looks nasty.
- Yeah.

143
00:06:49,152 --> 00:06:52,416
My neighbor, Rita, she's still inside.

144
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,941
I heard an explosion.
Then the whole building shook.

145
00:06:54,984 --> 00:06:57,378
OK, ma'am. Go with this lady.

146
00:06:57,421 --> 00:06:59,075
OK, it looks like
we got possible residents

147
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:00,381
on the second floor.

148
00:07:00,424 --> 00:07:02,339
But this industrial supply company,

149
00:07:02,383 --> 00:07:03,776
I've cited them multiple times

150
00:07:03,819 --> 00:07:06,213
for improperly storing
ammoniated compounds, so...

151
00:07:09,042 --> 00:07:10,826
OK, we need to clear those apartments

152
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:13,220
- before there's another blast.
- Copy, Chief.

153
00:07:13,263 --> 00:07:15,352
Truck, Squad, rapid primary search

154
00:07:15,396 --> 00:07:17,180
on the second floor. No lingering.

155
00:07:17,224 --> 00:07:19,182
Herrmann, I want two lines out there.

156
00:07:19,226 --> 00:07:21,402
- Hold that fire back.
- You got it, Chief.

157
00:07:21,445 --> 00:07:22,969
All right, Tony, find those utilities.

158
00:07:23,011 --> 00:07:25,275
- Capp, you're with me.
- Mouch, raise the aerial.

159
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,886
Carver, Gallo, let's go.

160
00:07:26,929 --> 00:07:28,061
- Copy.
- Copy.

161
00:07:28,104 --> 00:07:30,411
226 to Main, emergency.

162
00:07:30,454 --> 00:07:31,891
Start in a still and box alarm.

163
00:07:31,934 --> 00:07:33,675
Hazmat level one.

164
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:35,503
Come on, let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

165
00:07:35,546 --> 00:07:38,158
Come on!

166
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:48,124
All right, Squad is
gonna take the third floor.

167
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:49,430
Truck, you take two.

168
00:07:49,473 --> 00:07:51,871
Copy. In and out, like Chief said.

169
00:07:54,653 --> 00:07:58,221
All right, Carver, head back
and clear the corner unit.

170
00:07:58,265 --> 00:08:00,484
Copy that, Lieutenant.

171
00:08:00,528 --> 00:08:03,226
Gallo, you and me
will take these apartments.

172
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,967
Copy.

173
00:08:05,011 --> 00:08:06,403
Stay low!

174
00:08:07,317 --> 00:08:09,668
Fire department! Call out!

175
00:08:11,147 --> 00:08:12,627
Gallo!

176
00:08:12,671 --> 00:08:14,760
- Check the bedroom.
- Copy.

177
00:08:21,505 --> 00:08:23,725
The bedroom's clear, Lieutenant.

178
00:08:25,118 --> 00:08:26,698
Hey.

179
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,774
- What's wrong?
- I'm...

180
00:08:28,817 --> 00:08:30,776
I'm itching all over.
My arms are burning.

181
00:08:30,819 --> 00:08:32,733
I feel it too.

182
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:34,605
Chief, the smoke is bad.

183
00:08:34,649 --> 00:08:37,130
There's some kind of a
corrosive substance in the air.

184
00:08:37,173 --> 00:08:40,437
Same story here, Chief.
Our skin's on fire.

185
00:08:40,481 --> 00:08:44,007
Squad 3, Truck 81, evacuate immediately.

186
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,512
Fire department! Call out!

187
00:08:54,989 --> 00:08:57,078
I have a victim. Coming out now.

188
00:09:00,501 --> 00:09:02,068
Hey, take it easy. I got you.

189
00:09:16,909 --> 00:09:18,737
OK, Chief.

190
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:19,912
Hey.

191
00:09:19,955 --> 00:09:23,393
- Stand by for decon duties.
- All right.

192
00:09:25,395 --> 00:09:27,180
- Chief Boden.
- Yep.

193
00:09:27,223 --> 00:09:28,442
What's the situation?

194
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:30,444
Multiple explosions on the street level.

195
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:31,837
Possible hydrogen gas.

196
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,101
But could be muriatic acid
from the supply store

197
00:09:35,144 --> 00:09:37,581
reacting with metal shavings
from this machine shop.

198
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:39,018
Copy that, Chief. We'll handle it.

199
00:09:39,061 --> 00:09:40,193
Good.

200
00:09:48,418 --> 00:09:49,906
Hey, make way.

201
00:09:57,906 --> 00:09:59,386
You good?

202
00:10:01,344 --> 00:10:03,782
Squad, Truck, return to quarters.

203
00:10:03,825 --> 00:10:04,963
Shower and change.

204
00:10:09,613 --> 00:10:11,964
Hey. What happened to your mask?

205
00:10:12,007 --> 00:10:13,617
She knocked it off.

206
00:10:15,358 --> 00:10:17,404
- All right.
- We need to intubate her now.

207
00:10:21,234 --> 00:10:23,022
Hey, you OK?

208
00:10:25,412 --> 00:10:26,805
Carver!

209
00:10:28,676 --> 00:10:29,904
Hey!

210
00:10:34,987 --> 00:10:37,380
Sam Carver, firefighter.
Came in about 30 minutes ago.

211
00:10:37,424 --> 00:10:39,165
Yeah, trauma four.

212
00:10:44,431 --> 00:10:46,346
Lean forward for me.

213
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:52,802
Friends?

214
00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:54,920
Family.

215
00:10:54,963 --> 00:10:57,357
- How's he doing?
- Not bad, considering.

216
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,924
His bronchial linings took a hit

217
00:10:58,967 --> 00:11:01,491
from the chemicals he inhaled,
but there's no fluid.

218
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:03,276
And his oxygen saturation is solid.

219
00:11:03,319 --> 00:11:06,792
- Well, that's... good?
- It is.

220
00:11:06,836 --> 00:11:09,369
But we're gonna keep him
overnight just to be safe.

221
00:11:09,412 --> 00:11:11,153
Any word on the victim he came in with?

222
00:11:11,197 --> 00:11:13,242
She didn't fare as well.
Her lungs took a hit.

223
00:11:13,286 --> 00:11:14,866
We had to put her on a ventilator.

224
00:11:19,466 --> 00:11:21,468
All right, we're
gonna get out of your hair

225
00:11:21,511 --> 00:11:22,512
and let you rest.

226
00:11:22,809 --> 00:11:24,334
You take it easy.

227
00:11:26,212 --> 00:11:27,430
Um...

228
00:11:27,474 --> 00:11:29,606
Lieutenant, can I check on Lacey?

229
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:32,218
Oh, of course. Yeah, go.
We'll wait for you.

230
00:11:48,451 --> 00:11:49,626
You're awake.

231
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:51,890
Look at you in your uniform.

232
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:56,372
Oh, uh, how are you feeling?

233
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:57,852
I'm OK.

234
00:11:59,288 --> 00:12:00,942
Dr. Charles told me you're the one

235
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:02,944
that found me in the car
after the crash.

236
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:06,469
He said if it wasn't for you...

237
00:12:06,513 --> 00:12:10,299
The ambulance got there pretty quickly,
and took over, so...

238
00:12:10,343 --> 00:12:13,258
Well, I'm glad you were there.

239
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:24,270
Blake, I'm really sorry
about all of this.

240
00:12:24,313 --> 00:12:27,926
The accident,
the weird drunk texts, and...

241
00:12:31,581 --> 00:12:32,490
Anyway,

242
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:36,673
now you know what you've
been missing all these years.

243
00:12:36,717 --> 00:12:38,545
Hmm.

244
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,461
I wish your mom could see you.

245
00:12:44,899 --> 00:12:47,584
She would be so proud.

246
00:12:52,124 --> 00:12:53,995
I'm... I'm actually still on shift,

247
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:55,344
and my lieutenant's
waiting for me downstairs.

248
00:12:55,388 --> 00:12:57,129
Oh, yeah. Of course.

249
00:12:59,174 --> 00:13:01,014
I'll stop by when I'm off.

250
00:13:01,437 --> 00:13:02,569
OK.

251
00:13:14,755 --> 00:13:16,844
Hey, Blake.

252
00:13:16,887 --> 00:13:18,715
You got a second
to talk about your aunt?

253
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:20,065
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

254
00:13:20,108 --> 00:13:22,371
So they have her
on a peripheral nerve blocker

255
00:13:22,415 --> 00:13:25,592
to deal with the post-operative
pain instead of an opiate.

256
00:13:25,635 --> 00:13:27,637
But when she leaves the hospital,

257
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:29,030
she's gonna be

258
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:31,250
in a considerable amount of discomfort.

259
00:13:31,293 --> 00:13:33,034
And there's nothing you can prescribe?

260
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:34,949
There's plenty I could
prescribe, but, you know,

261
00:13:34,993 --> 00:13:36,472
she's concerned about her sobriety,

262
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:39,084
so she wants to tough out the pain.

263
00:13:39,127 --> 00:13:42,739
Well, that seems a little
counterproductive. Don't you think?

264
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:45,475
Pretty common response
from people in recovery.

265
00:13:46,004 --> 00:13:47,744
I just...

266
00:13:47,788 --> 00:13:49,572
I don't want her to suffer
any more than she has to.

267
00:13:49,616 --> 00:13:51,313
Well, there is
another option, all right?

268
00:13:51,357 --> 00:13:53,315
You might ask her
if she would be comfortable

269
00:13:53,359 --> 00:13:56,362
with you dispensing
the prescription medications.

270
00:13:56,405 --> 00:13:58,233
You know, you're her nephew.
You're a trained medic.

271
00:13:58,277 --> 00:13:59,582
It's a pretty common workaround.

272
00:13:59,626 --> 00:14:02,194
So, you know, just give it
a think, all right?

273
00:14:02,237 --> 00:14:04,500
'Cause she's got a tough road
ahead of her.

274
00:14:04,835 --> 00:14:06,315
OK. Thank you.

275
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,472
You bet.

276
00:14:11,594 --> 00:14:13,422
I wrote them up at least twice back

277
00:14:13,466 --> 00:14:15,250
when I was a battalion chief,

278
00:14:15,294 --> 00:14:17,470
but they are still
storing massive quantities

279
00:14:17,513 --> 00:14:20,255
of hazardous material
in a residential building.

280
00:14:20,299 --> 00:14:21,778
I'm here to find out why.

281
00:14:21,822 --> 00:14:25,869
Chief, I get that you're mad about this.

282
00:14:25,913 --> 00:14:30,004
And if you did report them,
I assure you, we followed up.

283
00:14:30,048 --> 00:14:31,092
Then why are they still at it?

284
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:32,224
I don't know.

285
00:14:32,267 --> 00:14:34,617
But we take every violation seriously.

286
00:14:34,661 --> 00:14:36,141
If that were the case, I wouldn't have

287
00:14:36,184 --> 00:14:38,926
a firefighter and a victim
in the hospital

288
00:14:38,969 --> 00:14:41,320
with chemical burns right now.

289
00:14:42,886 --> 00:14:44,701
Hell, I...

290
00:14:45,889 --> 00:14:48,196
I'm sorry, Chief.

291
00:14:49,676 --> 00:14:50,915
Are they gonna be OK?

292
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:55,169
God willing.

293
00:14:56,204 --> 00:14:57,901
But we wouldn't be asking this question

294
00:14:57,945 --> 00:15:00,121
if you'd have done your job.

295
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:02,123
I'll get to the bottom of it.

296
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:03,690
What's that address?

297
00:15:03,733 --> 00:15:05,344
3958 South Pershing.

298
00:15:05,387 --> 00:15:08,521
Loomis Industrial Supply.

299
00:15:10,871 --> 00:15:12,270
What is it?

300
00:15:13,091 --> 00:15:14,701
You know the place?

301
00:15:17,356 --> 00:15:21,070
Look, Director Valencia.

302
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:24,102
I'm not leaving your office
without answers.

303
00:15:27,627 --> 00:15:29,237
OK.

304
00:15:29,281 --> 00:15:30,913
But you gotta close the door.

305
00:15:40,596 --> 00:15:43,164
OK, this one's a little simpler.

306
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:44,905
Upside-down water bottle trick.

307
00:15:44,948 --> 00:15:47,037
What do you think?

308
00:15:47,081 --> 00:15:48,952
Simple, but messy.

309
00:15:48,996 --> 00:15:50,432
Well, then I have nothing.

310
00:15:50,476 --> 00:15:52,608
I can't find one trick
that I can learn by Saturday.

311
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:54,958
You did the floating card one earlier.

312
00:15:55,002 --> 00:15:57,483
The card never levitated.

313
00:15:57,526 --> 00:15:58,527
Of all the weekends Dylan's brother

314
00:15:58,571 --> 00:15:59,963
could have dragged him out of town.

315
00:16:00,007 --> 00:16:02,183
FaceTime him and have him
walk you through one.

316
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:04,185
I don't want to interrupt him
on his trip.

317
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:05,534
Plus, we could use the space.

318
00:16:05,578 --> 00:16:07,536
What? You guys seem great together.

319
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:10,539
We do, but I'm still
kind of finding my footing

320
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:13,456
after Hurricane Matt blew in
through town without warning.

321
00:16:16,676 --> 00:16:18,068
Hey, how's Carver?

322
00:16:18,112 --> 00:16:20,332
Oh, he's fine, the faker.

323
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:21,637
Minor burn of the trachea.

324
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:23,204
Ouch.

325
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:25,250
- Mm, Brett, you got a sec?
- Sure.

326
00:16:25,293 --> 00:16:28,470
Hey, I talked to Dr. Charles at Med,

327
00:16:28,514 --> 00:16:30,211
and he said Lacey's not accepting

328
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:31,517
anything stronger than ibuprofen.

329
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,346
- Sobriety concerns?
- Yeah.

330
00:16:34,389 --> 00:16:35,956
Brett and I run into this
a lot actually.

331
00:16:35,999 --> 00:16:37,522
I figured.

332
00:16:38,088 --> 00:16:39,690
Any advice?

333
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:42,180
Best thing you can do is

334
00:16:42,223 --> 00:16:44,312
come up with a treatment plan with her.

335
00:16:44,356 --> 00:16:46,445
Given those injuries,
that acute post-surgical pain

336
00:16:46,488 --> 00:16:48,534
is gonna kick her ass.

337
00:16:48,577 --> 00:16:49,992
Yeah.

338
00:16:50,449 --> 00:16:52,233
Maybe you should talk to her,

339
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:54,205
let her know
you're there to support her.

340
00:16:55,105 --> 00:16:57,934
Look, either she's gonna have
to suffer through the pain

341
00:16:57,978 --> 00:17:01,416
or she's gonna take the meds
and wrestle with her addiction.

342
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,636
Either way, she's gonna need help.

343
00:17:06,594 --> 00:17:09,075
OK, uh, just pick a card.

344
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,513
Yeah.

345
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:13,224
OK.

346
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:16,388
OK, now put it back in the deck.

347
00:17:16,811 --> 00:17:19,521
OK, and everyone can see

348
00:17:19,565 --> 00:17:23,003
that Cruz's card is completely
lost in the deck, right?

349
00:17:23,046 --> 00:17:24,046
- Yes.
- Oh, yeah.

350
00:17:24,091 --> 00:17:26,788
OK, so...

351
00:17:28,008 --> 00:17:29,270
OK.

352
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:31,200
Yeah, OK.

353
00:17:32,326 --> 00:17:33,536
Ah.

354
00:17:34,144 --> 00:17:35,972
Was your card the ten of hearts?

355
00:17:36,414 --> 00:17:37,707
No.

356
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:40,281
Shoot.

357
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:42,457
Hey, Chief, how'd it go downtown?

358
00:17:42,501 --> 00:17:45,243
Not good. What's the word on Carver?

359
00:17:45,286 --> 00:17:47,070
Looks like he's gonna be OK.

360
00:17:47,114 --> 00:17:48,420
Little damage to the throat,

361
00:17:48,463 --> 00:17:50,030
but not enough to keep him quiet.

362
00:17:50,073 --> 00:17:52,162
- Ha!
- What happened?

363
00:17:52,206 --> 00:17:53,468
You read them the riot act?

364
00:17:53,512 --> 00:17:55,514
Yeah, not that it did me any good.

365
00:17:55,557 --> 00:17:58,952
That chemical company has got
a guardian angel somewhere.

366
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:01,737
Every time they get caught
in a violation,

367
00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:03,696
the investigating agency gets pushback

368
00:18:03,739 --> 00:18:05,219
from someone up the food chain.

369
00:18:05,263 --> 00:18:06,655
Well, that's disgusting.

370
00:18:06,699 --> 00:18:09,310
Well, what do we do
to find this guardian angel?

371
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:11,834
The company supplies pool
cleaning chemicals to the city,

372
00:18:11,878 --> 00:18:14,315
so it's probably someone
involved with city contracts.

373
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:17,187
But whoever it is
must have some real juice.

374
00:18:17,231 --> 00:18:19,973
Valencia thinks it goes all the
way up to the city treasurer,

375
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:22,236
but I don't know.

376
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:26,109
The treasurer as in Don Ramsey?

377
00:18:26,153 --> 00:18:28,721
Yep, but I don't buy it.

378
00:18:28,764 --> 00:18:31,928
Ramsey seems like
a decent enough guy, right?

379
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,096
Chief, there's something
I gotta tell you.

380
00:18:40,988 --> 00:18:42,635
The fire was hardly anything.

381
00:18:42,678 --> 00:18:44,911
We never even had to stretch a hose.

382
00:18:44,954 --> 00:18:47,435
But after, in my sweep of the building,

383
00:18:47,479 --> 00:18:50,090
I came across Don Ramsey
hiding in a closet

384
00:18:50,133 --> 00:18:52,788
with a woman who was not his wife,

385
00:18:52,832 --> 00:18:54,964
and they were both half-dressed.

386
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:58,185
Hang on. Are you talking
about the artist lady?

387
00:18:58,228 --> 00:19:00,796
'Cause you told me
that you didn't get the name

388
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,450
of the guy that you saw her with.

389
00:19:02,494 --> 00:19:04,409
Which was technically true.

390
00:19:04,452 --> 00:19:07,368
I didn't realize who he was until later.

391
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:09,892
But the point is,

392
00:19:09,936 --> 00:19:11,677
he was scared I was gonna rat him out,

393
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,854
so he started keeping tabs on me,
making all kinds of threats.

394
00:19:14,897 --> 00:19:16,029
What kind of threats?

395
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:18,205
My job, my lieutenant's job.

396
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:23,036
He said he'd come
after the whole firehouse.

397
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:25,778
And you decided to take
the fate of this firehouse

398
00:19:25,821 --> 00:19:27,693
into your own hands?

399
00:19:27,736 --> 00:19:30,391
It just felt like something

400
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:33,220
I had to handle one on one, so I did.

401
00:19:33,263 --> 00:19:35,527
You shouldn't have kept me in the dark.

402
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:37,529
And you don't ever lie
to your lieutenant.

403
00:19:38,018 --> 00:19:39,846
It wasn't my intention to.

404
00:19:42,751 --> 00:19:46,799
I was just trying not to make
waves for Lieutenant Herrmann.

405
00:19:47,795 --> 00:19:50,193
He and Cindy were in the thick of it,

406
00:19:50,237 --> 00:19:53,240
and I just didn't want
to add to his stress.

407
00:19:55,997 --> 00:19:57,433
Continue.

408
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:04,251
Anyway, in the course
of that whole mess,

409
00:20:04,294 --> 00:20:07,950
I got a real unvarnished look
at Don Ramsey.

410
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:10,823
He's a sketchy dude.

411
00:20:10,866 --> 00:20:12,520
A liar, a cheat.

412
00:20:12,564 --> 00:20:15,131
Perfectly willing to use
the powers of his office

413
00:20:15,175 --> 00:20:16,742
in a personal vendetta.

414
00:20:16,785 --> 00:20:18,439
The guy basically stalked me

415
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:20,572
using his connections to the CFD.

416
00:20:20,615 --> 00:20:23,401
So he's more than willing
to use his position

417
00:20:23,444 --> 00:20:24,793
for personal gain.

418
00:20:24,837 --> 00:20:27,187
That could include payouts.

419
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:29,232
Ramsey has gotten a lot of ink

420
00:20:29,276 --> 00:20:31,539
for how he's managed to turn
the city's finances around.

421
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:35,282
Maybe the secret to his success
is giving out illicit contracts

422
00:20:35,325 --> 00:20:38,241
to shady companies who cut corners,

423
00:20:38,285 --> 00:20:40,113
like Loomis Industrial Supply.

424
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:41,723
He's the city treasurer, Chief.

425
00:20:41,767 --> 00:20:45,074
I mean, how do you go
after a guy like that head-on?

426
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:47,947
Well, maybe we need
to move this up the chain.

427
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:50,471
DC Hill is a good place to start.

428
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:55,302
She is a political animal,
but she knows right from wrong.

429
00:20:57,391 --> 00:20:58,392
Kylie!

430
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:02,222
Call DC Hill's office.

431
00:21:02,265 --> 00:21:04,703
See how fast you can
get a meeting on the books.

432
00:21:04,746 --> 00:21:06,313
- I'm on it, Chief.
- All right.

433
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:10,404
OK.

434
00:21:21,241 --> 00:21:22,329
Hey.

435
00:21:24,113 --> 00:21:26,376
I'm really sorry, Lieutenant.

436
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:29,162
I appreciate you keeping
an eye out for me, Ritter,

437
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:33,558
but you don't have
to protect me from bad news.

438
00:21:33,601 --> 00:21:35,429
I can handle it.

439
00:21:35,473 --> 00:21:36,654
It won't happen again.

440
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:45,178
Was your card the ten of diamonds?

441
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:47,289
Almost. Eight of hearts.

442
00:21:48,529 --> 00:21:52,446
Also, you're dropping cards
all over the firehouse.

443
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:53,534
Oh.

444
00:21:57,799 --> 00:21:59,235
Hey, Capp.

445
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:00,976
Oh, come on.

446
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,326
Just let me try it on you one more time.

447
00:22:03,806 --> 00:22:05,503
I blame myself. I encouraged her.

448
00:22:05,546 --> 00:22:07,548
Those poor kids.
That show is gonna blow.

449
00:22:08,854 --> 00:22:11,552
Hey, thank you for yesterday.

450
00:22:11,596 --> 00:22:13,728
I think I know a way
that I can support her,

451
00:22:13,772 --> 00:22:14,860
but I could use your help.

452
00:22:14,903 --> 00:22:17,111
- Yeah, whatever you need.
- Cool.

453
00:22:18,341 --> 00:22:19,995
I've been asking around
to some of the folks

454
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:22,911
who worked with Ramsey
when he was with the CFD.

455
00:22:22,955 --> 00:22:24,696
The more I learn about the man,

456
00:22:24,739 --> 00:22:28,090
the more certain I am
that it has to be him.

457
00:22:28,134 --> 00:22:31,083
I'm just asking you,
what's the best approach here?

458
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:34,532
If I were you,
I'd file an anonymous complaint

459
00:22:34,575 --> 00:22:36,925
with the inspector general's office.

460
00:22:36,969 --> 00:22:40,676
Then I'd go back to my district
and forget the whole thing.

461
00:22:41,669 --> 00:22:44,019
An anonymous complaint
won't move the needle.

462
00:22:44,063 --> 00:22:45,891
If Don Ramsey is responsible

463
00:22:45,934 --> 00:22:47,414
for those illegally stored chemicals,

464
00:22:47,457 --> 00:22:50,417
- he has to answer for it.
- If he's responsible.

465
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,724
But you have no concrete proof of that.

466
00:22:52,767 --> 00:22:56,554
That's why we need
an investigation to find proof.

467
00:22:56,597 --> 00:22:59,426
We're talking about one
of the most powerful people

468
00:22:59,469 --> 00:23:00,906
in Chicago.

469
00:23:00,949 --> 00:23:03,865
A man who could bust us
both down to battalion chief

470
00:23:03,909 --> 00:23:05,127
with a single phone call.

471
00:23:05,171 --> 00:23:08,522
And that's if he wants to go easy on us.

472
00:23:08,566 --> 00:23:12,134
Chief, without any hard evidence,

473
00:23:12,178 --> 00:23:13,571
you got nothing.

474
00:23:16,443 --> 00:23:19,590
So I'm supposed to just...

475
00:23:20,882 --> 00:23:22,449
forget about it?

476
00:23:23,624 --> 00:23:27,585
You don't take a shot at the
king unless you can kill him.

477
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:30,326
Mm.

478
00:23:33,852 --> 00:23:37,029
Joyce is looking pretty good,
don't you think?

479
00:23:37,072 --> 00:23:39,640
Maybe we bump her down
to biweekly visits.

480
00:23:39,684 --> 00:23:41,686
I am never gonna land this, am I?

481
00:23:41,729 --> 00:23:44,602
I could have sworn
she had the five of spades.

482
00:23:44,645 --> 00:23:47,474
Hey, she has early-onset dementia.

483
00:23:47,517 --> 00:23:49,955
She probably didn't remember
what her card even was.

484
00:23:49,998 --> 00:23:52,289
I can't believe I agreed to do this.

485
00:23:52,827 --> 00:23:54,176
It's the clap.

486
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:56,043
You're missing the clap.

487
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:57,789
The clap?

488
00:23:57,832 --> 00:23:59,660
What's that?

489
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:01,465
This...

490
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:05,274
is an abomination to magic.

491
00:24:14,283 --> 00:24:16,851
Now on three, clap.

492
00:24:16,895 --> 00:24:20,376
One, two, three.

493
00:24:24,119 --> 00:24:26,382
I distracted you
when you clapped your hands.

494
00:24:26,426 --> 00:24:28,428
It's the secret sauce to the trick.

495
00:24:28,471 --> 00:24:30,865
That one, you get for free.

496
00:24:30,909 --> 00:24:32,606
Oh, Mouch, you have
to help me on Saturday.

497
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:34,303
These kids are gonna eat me alive.

498
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:37,132
Toughest crowds are kids, Brett.

499
00:24:37,176 --> 00:24:38,830
No, please.

500
00:24:38,873 --> 00:24:41,093
Please, don't make me beg.

501
00:24:44,531 --> 00:24:45,583
Fine.

502
00:24:45,627 --> 00:24:47,708
But learn the basics first.

503
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:50,842
Number one:
there's no such thing as magic.

504
00:24:50,885 --> 00:24:52,060
Just illusion.

505
00:24:57,688 --> 00:24:59,589
The flower is a nice touch.

506
00:24:59,633 --> 00:25:00,850
Thanks.

507
00:25:00,893 --> 00:25:02,505
I guess all those hours of HGTV

508
00:25:02,549 --> 00:25:04,486
didn't go to waste after all.

509
00:25:05,291 --> 00:25:07,510
It's nice of you
to give up your bed for Lacey.

510
00:25:07,554 --> 00:25:09,512
It sure beats recovering at a hotel.

511
00:25:09,556 --> 00:25:11,210
We'll see. I mean,
I haven't had a chance

512
00:25:11,253 --> 00:25:13,168
to run it by her yet.

513
00:25:13,212 --> 00:25:14,648
Post-op recovery is no joke.

514
00:25:14,692 --> 00:25:17,042
She's very lucky
you're doing this for her.

515
00:25:17,085 --> 00:25:18,304
Yeah.

516
00:25:24,165 --> 00:25:25,776
Hey, what's that look about?

517
00:25:29,141 --> 00:25:30,751
It doesn't take a psychiatrist

518
00:25:30,795 --> 00:25:33,232
to know why I'm in this line of work.

519
00:25:33,275 --> 00:25:34,537
I pretty much spent my whole life

520
00:25:34,581 --> 00:25:37,671
trying to go back and save my sister.

521
00:25:37,715 --> 00:25:39,586
- Aw, Blake.
- No, it's delusional.

522
00:25:39,629 --> 00:25:43,111
I know. I can't help it, but...

523
00:25:44,939 --> 00:25:47,768
The other night, when
I pulled Lacey out of that car,

524
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:51,909
that was the first save
I've ever felt, like,

525
00:25:52,773 --> 00:25:57,386
even just a little bit
of, like, redemption.

526
00:25:58,866 --> 00:26:01,956
So I'm not sure
if I'm doing this for her

527
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,462
or if it's for me.

528
00:26:04,872 --> 00:26:07,007
It doesn't matter why you're doing it.

529
00:26:07,657 --> 00:26:09,311
This is a kindness that could change

530
00:26:09,355 --> 00:26:11,226
the whole trajectory of her life.

531
00:26:15,143 --> 00:26:18,407
Come on. Let's clear out all the booze.

532
00:26:21,584 --> 00:26:23,649
We're gonna need a bigger box.

533
00:26:25,371 --> 00:26:28,026
Um, my wife ordered online.

534
00:26:28,069 --> 00:26:30,463
- Name's Boden.
- One second.

535
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:35,076
Boden, as in Wallace Boden? Don Ramsey.

536
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,341
We met a few years back
at one CFD event or another.

537
00:26:40,168 --> 00:26:42,127
Yeah, sure.

538
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:45,478
Do you, uh... you live around here?

539
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:48,674
No, but I'll always
go out of my way for Manny's.

540
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:52,833
Hey, you're
at Firehouse 51 still, right?

541
00:26:52,877 --> 00:26:54,748
I heard one of your guys
got hurt yesterday.

542
00:26:54,792 --> 00:26:56,228
Not too bad, I hope.

543
00:26:57,359 --> 00:26:58,970
He's recovering.

544
00:26:59,013 --> 00:27:01,886
Good. Good.

545
00:27:01,929 --> 00:27:03,539
My days with the CFD are behind me,

546
00:27:03,583 --> 00:27:05,715
but I'll always have a soft
spot for our firefighters.

547
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:07,500
Mm.

548
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:09,545
I know that might sound insincere

549
00:27:09,589 --> 00:27:11,822
given all the recent budget cuts.

550
00:27:12,418 --> 00:27:14,507
But hey, now that
we're making our numbers,

551
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,900
I could probably
loosen the purse strings

552
00:27:15,943 --> 00:27:18,772
and find some extra funding
for your district.

553
00:27:18,816 --> 00:27:20,622
If that would help.

554
00:27:21,035 --> 00:27:22,254
Here you go.

555
00:27:22,297 --> 00:27:24,734
Ah, thank you.

556
00:27:24,778 --> 00:27:29,609
Um, you know, I got bigger
concerns than budget cuts,

557
00:27:29,652 --> 00:27:31,611
like the fact that
someone in city government

558
00:27:31,654 --> 00:27:34,701
is skirting regulations and
putting firefighters at risk.

559
00:27:36,964 --> 00:27:39,099
I'm gonna take them down.

560
00:27:41,142 --> 00:27:43,520
Enjoy your meal, Mr. Treasurer.

561
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,727
You guys really start early, don't you?

562
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:01,902
Not always this early.

563
00:28:01,946 --> 00:28:04,035
I have to go to the store and make sure

564
00:28:04,078 --> 00:28:07,168
I have enough bacon for
a dozen hungry firefighters.

565
00:28:07,212 --> 00:28:09,997
You kept up with your cooking, huh?

566
00:28:10,041 --> 00:28:11,520
You always had a knack for it.

567
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:13,914
Well, I had a good teacher.

568
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:15,916
You remember when I taught you

569
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,962
how to make baked mac and cheese?

570
00:28:18,005 --> 00:28:20,312
Oh.

571
00:28:20,355 --> 00:28:23,184
And I dumped, what was it,
two pounds of macaroni

572
00:28:23,228 --> 00:28:24,838
- all over the stovetop?
- Oh, God.

573
00:28:24,882 --> 00:28:27,449
You turned beet red. It was so cute.

574
00:28:28,755 --> 00:28:30,235
Hey, um...

575
00:28:33,542 --> 00:28:35,893
I know you're worried
about abusing your pain meds

576
00:28:35,936 --> 00:28:38,617
when you're discharged, but don't be.

577
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:42,377
I want to be there to support
you every step of the way.

578
00:28:42,421 --> 00:28:44,031
Oh, you've done plenty already.

579
00:28:44,075 --> 00:28:46,599
Don't get caught up in my mess.

580
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:48,818
You can't do it alone, Lacey.

581
00:28:48,862 --> 00:28:50,472
So you're gonna stay with me.

582
00:28:50,516 --> 00:28:51,909
I already have everything
set up for you.

583
00:28:51,952 --> 00:28:55,092
No, Blake, after everything,
that's not fair.

584
00:28:55,913 --> 00:28:58,176
I can't be a burden to you.

585
00:28:58,219 --> 00:29:00,482
You're not a burden to me.

586
00:29:00,526 --> 00:29:01,723
You're family.

587
00:29:16,281 --> 00:29:17,586
What the hell?

588
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,414
Does he got a tracker
on your car or something?

589
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:21,242
Probably followed me from my house.

590
00:29:21,286 --> 00:29:23,070
All I know is, it was no coincidence.

591
00:29:23,114 --> 00:29:24,942
- That's creepy.
- How did he find out

592
00:29:24,985 --> 00:29:26,249
that you were gunning for him?

593
00:29:26,293 --> 00:29:28,989
I mean, did DC Hill rat you out?

594
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:30,556
- No way.
- I asked a few people

595
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:32,688
about him when I was at HQ.
I should have been more careful.

596
00:29:32,732 --> 00:29:34,212
Yeah, one thing I learned,

597
00:29:34,255 --> 00:29:36,344
Ramsey's still
got connections in the CFD.

598
00:29:36,388 --> 00:29:38,085
How he knows doesn't really matter.

599
00:29:38,129 --> 00:29:40,000
The point is, he knows.

600
00:29:40,044 --> 00:29:41,610
Yeah, but he's tipped his hand too.

601
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:43,699
Now we know we're barking up
the right tree.

602
00:29:43,743 --> 00:29:45,136
- Yes.
- But we still need proof.

603
00:29:45,179 --> 00:29:47,703
So what'd you find out
about that company?

604
00:29:47,747 --> 00:29:48,835
I did some digging.

605
00:29:48,878 --> 00:29:51,011
Just public records, stuff like that.

606
00:29:51,055 --> 00:29:53,971
Loomis Industrial Supply
is owned by a holding company

607
00:29:54,014 --> 00:29:56,364
called McGrath-Hewitt LLC.

608
00:29:56,408 --> 00:29:58,105
They own a bunch of companies,
and they all seem

609
00:29:58,149 --> 00:29:59,889
to work under city contracts...

610
00:29:59,933 --> 00:30:02,283
office supplies, printing services,

611
00:30:02,327 --> 00:30:04,242
auto parts for city vehicles.

612
00:30:04,285 --> 00:30:06,635
So this is bigger than one contract.

613
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:09,290
There could be a whole network
of shady companies out there

614
00:30:09,334 --> 00:30:11,162
just cutting corners for him.

615
00:30:11,205 --> 00:30:13,077
And if we can link Ramsey
to any of them,

616
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,035
that connects him to all of them.

617
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:17,037
What kind of a link are we looking for?

618
00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:20,093
I don't know. If he has
a financial interest or...

619
00:30:21,261 --> 00:30:23,522
If they contributed to his
campaign, that might be enough.

620
00:30:23,565 --> 00:30:25,350
- I'll get Kylie on that.
- All right.

621
00:30:25,393 --> 00:30:28,135
Meantime, why don't we take a look

622
00:30:28,179 --> 00:30:29,876
at some of these places,
see what we can find?

623
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:33,271
And what, just start knocking
on doors asking questions?

624
00:30:33,314 --> 00:30:35,012
Random inspections, you know,

625
00:30:35,055 --> 00:30:37,492
looking for fire code violations.

626
00:30:37,536 --> 00:30:40,365
Just pop in, peek behind
the curtain, see what's what.

627
00:30:40,408 --> 00:30:42,323
Yeah, it's better
than sitting on our hands

628
00:30:42,367 --> 00:30:44,673
waiting for Ramsey to come after us.

629
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:46,328
- Yeah.
- OK.

630
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:48,580
But keep a low profile.

631
00:30:49,069 --> 00:30:50,984
Low profile's my middle name.

632
00:30:52,986 --> 00:30:55,423
OK, now put your card back in the deck.

633
00:30:57,382 --> 00:31:00,385
OK, on the count of three,
I want you to clap.

634
00:31:00,428 --> 00:31:03,214
One, two, three.

635
00:31:04,911 --> 00:31:07,224
And was this your card?

636
00:31:07,609 --> 00:31:09,307
Oh, incredible.

637
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:11,178
Oh!

638
00:31:11,222 --> 00:31:14,181
Patience, persistence, performance.

639
00:31:14,225 --> 00:31:16,400
Oh, my God. Are you kidding me?
Was this really your card?

640
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:19,360
It's the right suit.

641
00:31:19,404 --> 00:31:21,275
I'm sorry. It's just
you were giving it your all.

642
00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:23,408
I felt bad.

643
00:31:23,451 --> 00:31:25,410
81, mount up.

644
00:31:25,453 --> 00:31:26,889
We're gonna go sniff
around a few companies

645
00:31:26,933 --> 00:31:28,543
that might be affiliates of Ramsey's.

646
00:31:28,587 --> 00:31:29,544
Hell yes.

647
00:31:31,633 --> 00:31:33,287
Rome wasn't built in a day,

648
00:31:33,331 --> 00:31:36,508
and Harry didn't
become Houdini overnight.

649
00:31:48,085 --> 00:31:50,826
Oh, boy, every one of these companies

650
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:52,769
is even shabbier than the last one.

651
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:59,400
Fire hazard, OSHA violation.

652
00:31:59,444 --> 00:32:00,793
I mean, they all look fly-by-night,

653
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:03,752
like they only exist
to service these contracts.

654
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:06,581
- Help you guys?
- Yeah, CFD.

655
00:32:06,625 --> 00:32:08,453
Popping in for a quick inspection.

656
00:32:08,496 --> 00:32:10,890
- Oh, man. Really?
- Yeah.

657
00:32:10,933 --> 00:32:14,720
I can already see that you guys
got some issues to address.

658
00:32:14,763 --> 00:32:17,244
- Is the owner around?
- The owner is Mr. McGrath.

659
00:32:17,288 --> 00:32:19,028
He's not really the hands-on type.

660
00:32:19,072 --> 00:32:21,161
But his sister dropped by
to do the books.

661
00:32:21,205 --> 00:32:22,989
- You want to talk to her?
- Yeah, thanks.

662
00:32:23,032 --> 00:32:25,252
Yo, Tanya!

663
00:32:25,296 --> 00:32:28,560
That'd be McGrath of McGrath-Hewitt LLC.

664
00:32:28,603 --> 00:32:31,345
- "Not really the hands-on type."
- Yeah.

665
00:32:31,389 --> 00:32:33,739
Hey, how great would it be

666
00:32:33,782 --> 00:32:37,090
if they were printing up
Don Ramsey campaign flyers?

667
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:46,143
Hey, how do I know her?

668
00:32:46,186 --> 00:32:47,361
That's the lady from the art studio.

669
00:32:47,405 --> 00:32:48,884
Herrmann, we gotta get out of here.

670
00:32:48,928 --> 00:32:50,495
That's Don Ramsey's mistress.

671
00:32:50,538 --> 00:32:51,800
Copy that, Main.

672
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:53,280
51 on the way.

673
00:32:53,324 --> 00:32:54,760
Can I help you, gentlemen?

674
00:32:54,803 --> 00:32:56,762
No, we just caught a house fire, ma'am.

675
00:32:56,805 --> 00:32:59,544
Sorry to bother you.
You're off the hook.

676
00:33:05,814 --> 00:33:07,338
You think she recognized you?

677
00:33:07,381 --> 00:33:08,817
The two of us together
in our bunker gear?

678
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:09,992
Pretty good chance.

679
00:33:10,036 --> 00:33:11,646
So much for keeping a low profile.

680
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:13,692
I know, Chief, but this is a lock.

681
00:33:13,735 --> 00:33:16,303
We now know for sure
that Ramsey is in bed

682
00:33:16,347 --> 00:33:17,957
with the McGrath-Hewitt companies

683
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,351
because he's literally in bed
with McGrath's sister, Tanya.

684
00:33:20,394 --> 00:33:22,918
OK, so how do we use this?

685
00:33:22,962 --> 00:33:24,355
Look.

686
00:33:24,398 --> 00:33:27,271
If you are willing to go
on record about the affair...

687
00:33:27,314 --> 00:33:29,273
- I am.
- Maybe we can use that

688
00:33:29,316 --> 00:33:30,491
to shore up the case against Ramsey.

689
00:33:30,535 --> 00:33:32,580
Go back to Director Valencia
and DC Hill,

690
00:33:32,624 --> 00:33:33,929
and we see if we get 'em on board.

691
00:33:33,973 --> 00:33:36,018
What about a reporter?

692
00:33:36,062 --> 00:33:38,499
We give them the scoop,
and we see if they run with it.

693
00:33:38,543 --> 00:33:40,022
Good. Yes.

694
00:33:40,066 --> 00:33:42,068
Chief, sorry to interrupt,

695
00:33:42,111 --> 00:33:45,419
but Don Ramsey's office is on the line.

696
00:33:45,463 --> 00:33:47,552
He'd like to meet with you.

697
00:34:05,134 --> 00:34:06,875
Deputy District Chief Wallace Boden.

698
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:08,137
Here to see Don Ramsey.

699
00:34:08,181 --> 00:34:10,749
Yes, Chief. Thank you for coming.

700
00:34:10,791 --> 00:34:12,532
Chief Boden is here, sir.

701
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:17,998
Chief, thanks so much for coming.

702
00:34:18,619 --> 00:34:21,585
You got something to say to me, say it.

703
00:34:24,066 --> 00:34:26,634
Chief, why don't you come inside?

704
00:34:35,295 --> 00:34:38,124
Folks, this is the man
I've been telling you about.

705
00:34:38,166 --> 00:34:41,693
Deputy District Chief
Wallace Boden of the CFD.

706
00:34:41,735 --> 00:34:43,347
We have him to thank for rooting out

707
00:34:43,389 --> 00:34:46,001
this corrupt enterprise that's
been siphoning our tax dollars

708
00:34:46,045 --> 00:34:48,655
and putting our citizens
and first responders at risk.

709
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,049
What the hell is this?

710
00:34:50,092 --> 00:34:51,224
- You think I can be bought?
- I'm sorry.

711
00:34:51,268 --> 00:34:52,747
I didn't mean to ambush you like this.

712
00:34:52,791 --> 00:34:54,139
I know you don't do this
for the accolades,

713
00:34:54,183 --> 00:34:55,793
but you deserve them nonetheless.

714
00:34:55,837 --> 00:34:57,404
Because of you, we're gonna review

715
00:34:57,448 --> 00:34:58,666
all current city contracts

716
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:00,973
and clean up this sort of corruption.

717
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:02,191
Because what happened
to your firefighter

718
00:35:02,235 --> 00:35:03,932
is never gonna happen again on my watch.

719
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:05,325
I promise you that.

720
00:35:13,464 --> 00:35:15,030
Boden.

721
00:35:15,074 --> 00:35:16,336
I don't know what you think
you're doing here...

722
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,338
I'm letting you be the hero, Boden.

723
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:20,819
You want to blow this all up? Go ahead.

724
00:35:20,862 --> 00:35:22,777
Make a scene, file your complaints,

725
00:35:22,821 --> 00:35:25,867
try to take me down
if you think you can.

726
00:35:25,911 --> 00:35:28,130
But if I were you, I'd take the win.

727
00:35:28,174 --> 00:35:29,741
We're gonna shut down
all those companies,

728
00:35:29,784 --> 00:35:32,352
clean up the whole contract process.

729
00:35:32,396 --> 00:35:35,834
Isn't that what you wanted?
To make the city safer?

730
00:35:42,493 --> 00:35:45,626
OK, and now,

731
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:48,673
the Astonishing Sylvie will perform

732
00:35:48,716 --> 00:35:51,240
"The Vanishing Milk Trick."

733
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:55,984
As you can see, I have a glass of milk.

734
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:59,161
And now, I'm going to very carefully

735
00:35:59,205 --> 00:36:01,685
pour the milk into the newspaper.

736
00:36:07,648 --> 00:36:09,650
Hmm...

737
00:36:09,694 --> 00:36:11,217
And...

738
00:36:12,566 --> 00:36:14,197
Voilà.

739
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:16,265
No milk.

740
00:36:21,619 --> 00:36:23,403
I'm dying up here.

741
00:36:23,447 --> 00:36:25,579
Patience, persistence,

742
00:36:25,623 --> 00:36:27,712
performance.

743
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,500
Oh.

744
00:36:35,502 --> 00:36:37,591
Pick a card, any card.

745
00:36:37,635 --> 00:36:40,072
In a faraway land,

746
00:36:40,115 --> 00:36:45,164
an evil magician named Gorsch
used his magic powers

747
00:36:45,207 --> 00:36:49,386
to curse good-hearted magicians
like The Astonishing Sylvie.

748
00:36:49,429 --> 00:36:50,865
What are you doing? You're going rogue.

749
00:36:50,909 --> 00:36:54,652
But if the curse causes Sylvie to fail,

750
00:36:54,695 --> 00:36:56,448
fear not!

751
00:36:57,350 --> 00:36:58,917
Candy for everyone!

752
00:37:07,229 --> 00:37:08,230
OK.

753
00:37:16,456 --> 00:37:19,372
And is this your card?

754
00:37:22,157 --> 00:37:25,334
- Really? I did it!
- Oh!

755
00:37:25,378 --> 00:37:27,424
I did it. And you didn't think I could.

756
00:37:27,467 --> 00:37:29,991
A magician prepares
for every contingency.

757
00:37:30,035 --> 00:37:31,689
I want candy!

758
00:37:31,732 --> 00:37:34,256
Where's the candy?

759
00:37:49,271 --> 00:37:50,664
Excuse me.

760
00:37:50,708 --> 00:37:52,274
Hey, um...

761
00:37:52,318 --> 00:37:54,668
was the patient that was
in here moved to another room?

762
00:37:54,712 --> 00:37:56,365
- Lacey Hoffman?
- Yeah.

763
00:37:56,409 --> 00:37:59,010
She was discharged a few hours ago.

764
00:38:00,718 --> 00:38:02,981
Are you sure? I'm supposed
to be picking her up.

765
00:38:03,024 --> 00:38:05,141
Yeah, I have her
discharge summary right here.

766
00:38:05,636 --> 00:38:07,072
I'm sorry.

767
00:38:13,905 --> 00:38:16,777
For her first trick of the evening,

768
00:38:16,821 --> 00:38:20,302
making a glass of bubbly disappear.

769
00:38:20,346 --> 00:38:23,436
Is this an apology or a compliment?

770
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:27,353
Both praise and a peace offering.

771
00:38:27,396 --> 00:38:28,665
Hmm.

772
00:38:29,224 --> 00:38:32,576
Brett, that was a hell
of a show you put on.

773
00:38:32,619 --> 00:38:34,099
Dylan's gonna be proud.

774
00:38:34,142 --> 00:38:35,927
Unless I got him blacklisted.

775
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:38,146
Well, here's to hoping you didn't.

776
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:41,541
And, uh, drink slowly.

777
00:38:41,585 --> 00:38:43,804
This is the good stuff from the back.

778
00:38:43,848 --> 00:38:45,545
Really?

779
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:46,633
Does Herrmann...

780
00:38:46,677 --> 00:38:48,200
No.

781
00:38:48,243 --> 00:38:50,115
When I ran for office,

782
00:38:50,158 --> 00:38:52,683
this was the exact type
of waste and fraud

783
00:38:52,726 --> 00:38:54,554
that I promised to stamp out.

784
00:38:54,598 --> 00:38:56,295
And I keep my promises.

785
00:38:56,338 --> 00:38:58,471
That is one punchable face.

786
00:38:58,515 --> 00:39:00,125
We've already voided the contract

787
00:39:00,168 --> 00:39:01,822
for Loomis Industrial Supply

788
00:39:01,866 --> 00:39:03,128
and are moving to press charges

789
00:39:03,171 --> 00:39:04,608
against anyone responsible

790
00:39:04,651 --> 00:39:07,132
for improperly storing those chemicals.

791
00:39:07,175 --> 00:39:08,525
And that's just the beginning.

792
00:39:08,568 --> 00:39:09,613
Turn it off.

793
00:39:09,656 --> 00:39:11,179
My department is fo...

794
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:14,461
He should be in jail.

795
00:39:14,879 --> 00:39:17,255
Instead, he's doing a victory lap.

796
00:39:17,838 --> 00:39:19,549
Hey, Chief.

797
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:22,321
You played this the only way you could.

798
00:39:22,364 --> 00:39:23,757
And we got what we were after.

799
00:39:23,801 --> 00:39:26,931
So why do I have
such a bad taste in my mouth?

800
00:39:27,761 --> 00:39:29,937
I gotta be honest, Chief.

801
00:39:29,981 --> 00:39:33,158
I'm impressed with your restraint.

802
00:39:33,201 --> 00:39:34,681
Deputy Commissioner.

803
00:39:34,725 --> 00:39:36,857
I thought you might
knock Ramsey on his ass

804
00:39:36,901 --> 00:39:39,027
and get yourself arrested.

805
00:39:39,425 --> 00:39:43,211
Well, I guess I'm mellowing
in my old age.

806
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:44,561
No, that's not it.

807
00:39:44,604 --> 00:39:47,912
You're just learning
the politics of this job.

808
00:39:47,955 --> 00:39:49,621
Finally.

809
00:39:50,131 --> 00:39:52,569
Is it supposed to feel this awful?

810
00:39:52,878 --> 00:39:54,837
Every time.

811
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,794
It's been a back and forth battle

812
00:40:00,838 --> 00:40:02,404
so far through the first,

813
00:40:02,448 --> 00:40:04,493
but Houston's managed
to hold onto the lead.

814
00:40:04,537 --> 00:40:06,452
What does Philly have to do
to get back in this game?

815
00:40:06,495 --> 00:40:09,498
Well, they need to start
locking down their shots.

816
00:40:17,637 --> 00:40:20,466
I picked the worst time
to dump all my beer.

817
00:40:25,516 --> 00:40:27,212
Blake. Oh, thank God.

818
00:40:27,255 --> 00:40:29,040
This is the third door I tried.

819
00:40:30,215 --> 00:40:32,173
I-I didn't want to come empty-handed,

820
00:40:32,217 --> 00:40:33,697
so I thought maybe

821
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:35,786
we could make
your mom's baked potato soup.

822
00:40:35,829 --> 00:40:38,615
So, you know, I just...

823
00:40:43,968 --> 00:40:45,230
Oh.

824
00:40:46,797 --> 00:40:48,320
Oh, God.
