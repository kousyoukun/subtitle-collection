1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,400
<font color="#ffffff">Inside every museum</font>

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,560
<font color="#ffffff">is a hidden world.</font>

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:13,920
<font color="#ffffff">Now, for the first time, cameras</font>
<font color="#ffffff">have been allowed behind the scenes</font>

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,320
<font color="#ffffff">at the Victoria and Albert Museum...</font>

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,240
<font color="#ffff00">Here we are. Elton John.</font>

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,040
<font color="#ffff00">Wonderful piece of theatrical bling.</font>

7
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,200
<font color="#ffffff">..home to more than two million</font>
<font color="#ffffff">wonders of art,</font>

8
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,160
<font color="#ffffff">design and performance.</font>

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,600
<font color="#00ffff">This gentleman has a little cloak</font>
<font color="#00ffff">that you can lift up and see</font>

10
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,400
<font color="#00ffff">what he's wearing underneath.</font>

11
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,560
<font color="#ffffff">But only a small part of</font>
<font color="#ffffff">the collection is on display.</font>

12
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,840
<font color="#ffff00">One of our show pieces designed</font>
<font color="#ffff00">for the Queen.</font>

13
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,080
<font color="#ffff00">Every time I see it, I notice</font>
<font color="#ffff00">something that I didn't spot before.</font>

14
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:44,480
<font color="#ffffff">Inside the stores are treasures</font>
<font color="#ffffff">many of us never see.</font>

15
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,200
<font color="#00ffff">Ah, his eyes are open.</font>

16
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,440
<font color="#00ffff">He looks like...as if he's about</font>
<font color="#00ffff">to grab my hand or something.</font>

17
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,240
<font color="#ffffff">And an army of experts is at work...</font>

18
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,320
<font color="#ffff00">This bit always makes me feel</font>
<font color="#ffff00">a bit like a plastic surgeon,</font>

19
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,120
<font color="#ffff00">stitching up the skin.</font>

20
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,560
<font color="#ffffff">..bringing masterpieces to light...</font>

21
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,600
<font color="#00ffff">It does feel like a magical</font>
<font color="#00ffff">world because it feels</font>

22
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,040
<font color="#00ffff">like you've been shrunk</font>
<font color="#00ffff">to their size.</font>

23
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,000
<font color="#ffffff">..restoring our heritage</font>

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,400
<font color="#ffffff">and breathing new life</font>
<font color="#ffffff">into fragile marvels...</font>

25
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,640
<font color="#ffff00">It's one of three volumes</font>
<font color="#ffff00">by Leonardo da Vinci.</font>

26
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,680
<font color="#ffffff">..to keep the past alive</font>
<font color="#ffffff">for all of us.</font>

27
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,160
<font color="#00ffff">The thing about the V&A is that it's</font>
<font color="#00ffff">a national collection.</font>

28
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,160
<font color="#00ffff">It's owned by everybody.</font>

29
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:35,080
<font color="#ffffff">Every day, the V&A's curators</font>
<font color="#ffffff">and conservators are at work</font>

30
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,960
<font color="#ffffff">on wonders large and small,</font>

31
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,880
<font color="#ffffff">trying to keep the past alive.</font>

32
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,120
<font color="#ffffff">And each close encounter</font>

33
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:46,240
<font color="#ffffff">is also a chance to unlock an</font>
<font color="#ffffff">object's secrets.</font>

34
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,520
<font color="#ffff00">When you're working with that one</font>
<font color="#ffff00">particular beautiful object all day,</font>

35
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:56,720
<font color="#ffff00">just you and the object,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">you become invested in it and</font>

36
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,680
<font color="#ffff00">you want to sort of investigate</font>
<font color="#ffff00">the history of them to try and find</font>

37
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,120
<font color="#ffff00">out what is so special</font>
<font color="#ffff00">about this object.</font>

38
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,240
<font color="#ffff00">Isn't that a privilege</font>
<font color="#ffff00">to be able to do that?</font>

39
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,320
<font color="#ffffff">But some of the treasures</font>
<font color="#ffffff">in the stores are in need</font>

40
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,480
<font color="#ffffff">of some serious TLC.</font>

41
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,480
<font color="#00ffff">So this is what we call Store Eight,</font>

42
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,320
<font color="#00ffff">which is our main toy store</font>
<font color="#00ffff">at the museum.</font>

43
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,120
<font color="#ffffff">The V&A's Museum of Childhood</font>
<font color="#ffffff">houses Britain's biggest collection</font>

44
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,040
<font color="#ffffff">of toys from the past,</font>

45
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,680
<font color="#ffffff">including one character who hasn't</font>
<font color="#ffffff">aged very well at all.</font>

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,320
<font color="#00ffff">So we're about to meet</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Pumpie the elephant.</font>

47
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,920
<font color="#00ffff">And he's a real star of our</font>
<font color="#00ffff">collection, he's very well loved,</font>

48
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,760
<font color="#00ffff">as you can tell</font>
<font color="#00ffff">from the state of him.</font>

49
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,840
<font color="#ffffff">Pumpie is a homemade elephant,</font>

50
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,640
<font color="#ffffff">stitched together from odds</font>
<font color="#ffffff">and ends over 100 years ago.</font>

51
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,640
<font color="#ffffff">Before he came to the museum,</font>
<font color="#ffffff">he had a hard life.</font>

52
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:13,480
<font color="#00ffff">So he's most profoundly</font>
<font color="#00ffff">missing one of his ears,</font>

53
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,000
<font color="#00ffff">and his trunk has seen better days.</font>

54
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,320
<font color="#00ffff">We're a bit worried about Pumpie</font>

55
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,000
<font color="#00ffff">because he has got quite</font>
<font color="#00ffff">a lot of signs of damage,</font>

56
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,360
<font color="#00ffff">he's been very heavily</font>
<font color="#00ffff">played with, but also,</font>

57
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,920
<font color="#00ffff">he's made from sort of tasty</font>
<font color="#00ffff">natural materials,</font>

58
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,880
<font color="#00ffff">so he's been attacked several</font>
<font color="#00ffff">times by insects in the past.</font>

59
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,160
<font color="#00ffff">But that's also part of his charm.</font>

60
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,840
<font color="#ffffff">This moth-eaten elephant</font>

61
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,920
<font color="#ffffff">was the cherished toy</font>
<font color="#ffffff">of the Cattley family...</font>

62
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,600
<font color="#ffffff">..five brothers and sisters</font>

63
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,000
<font color="#ffffff">who lived in West London</font>
<font color="#ffffff">in the early 1900s.</font>

64
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,600
<font color="#00ffff">We think he might have been</font>
<font color="#00ffff">handmade by children,</font>

65
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,360
<font color="#00ffff">but we don't know that for sure.</font>

66
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,760
<font color="#00ffff">But we're absolutely certain</font>
<font color="#00ffff">his clothes were made for him</font>

67
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,160
<font color="#00ffff">by these five siblings</font>
<font color="#00ffff">who lived in Ealing.</font>

68
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,440
<font color="#00ffff">He's got all his admiralty</font>
<font color="#00ffff">brass buttons</font>

69
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,240
<font color="#00ffff">all over his sailor's uniform.</font>

70
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,360
<font color="#00ffff">He's brilliant, in a way, cos he's a</font>
<font color="#00ffff">kind of quintessential colonial toy</font>

71
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,640
<font color="#00ffff">for a middle-class family,</font>

72
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,640
<font color="#00ffff">in the sense he's an elephant -</font>
<font color="#00ffff">I think he's an Indian elephant,</font>

73
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,160
<font color="#00ffff">he's certainly got quite small ears,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">but he's also a sailor</font>

74
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,720
<font color="#00ffff">and Britain is this sort of</font>
<font color="#00ffff">extremely important</font>

75
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:16,160
<font color="#00ffff">maritime power, so he's</font>
<font color="#00ffff">a very sort of imperial toy.</font>

76
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,840
<font color="#ffffff">Pumpie is a relic of an era when</font>
<font color="#ffffff">toys weren't thrown away after</font>

77
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,120
<font color="#ffffff">a few years, but were considered</font>
<font color="#ffffff">part of the family.</font>

78
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,480
<font color="#00ffff">This is a photo album made by the</font>
<font color="#00ffff">children, in which they photographed</font>

79
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:33,560
<font color="#00ffff">all their toys in various poses,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">so here's a good Pumpie page.</font>

80
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,880
<font color="#00ffff">There he is, on the beach.</font>

81
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,400
<font color="#00ffff">For us, the fact they</font>
<font color="#00ffff">took him on holiday,</font>

82
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,800
<font color="#00ffff">photographed him on the beach,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">that sort of thing,</font>

83
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,320
<font color="#00ffff">did paintings of them posed at home,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">offers a really, like, genuine</font>

84
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,120
<font color="#00ffff">and very charming insight</font>
<font color="#00ffff">into a period of history,</font>

85
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,080
<font color="#00ffff">but also an insight into how</font>
<font color="#00ffff">children think and feel.</font>

86
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,160
<font color="#ffffff">Now, the Wellcome Collection</font>
<font color="#ffffff">has asked for Pumpie to</font>

87
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:02,080
<font color="#ffffff">appear in a new exhibition,</font>
<font color="#ffffff">celebrating children's play.</font>

88
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,120
<font color="#ffffff">But in his present state,</font>
<font color="#ffffff">he can't travel.</font>

89
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,320
<font color="#00ffff">Pumpie isn't currently on display</font>
<font color="#00ffff">at the Museum of Childhood</font>

90
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,640
<font color="#00ffff">because he is very vulnerable.</font>

91
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,440
<font color="#00ffff">So I'm really hoping that</font>
<font color="#00ffff">conservation will make him</font>

92
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,840
<font color="#00ffff">stable enough for display.</font>

93
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,200
<font color="#00ff00">Is that him? </font><font color="#00ffff">That's him in there,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">yeah. </font><font color="#00ff00">Oh, good. Right.</font>

94
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,760
<font color="#ffffff">Conservator Jo must try</font>
<font color="#ffffff">to patch him up.</font>

95
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,480
<font color="#00ff00">Poor old ear, though. </font><font color="#00ffff">Yeah.</font>

96
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,760
<font color="#00ffff">One eye, one ear.</font>

97
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,120
<font color="#00ff00">This is the main problem, his nose.</font>

98
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,720
<font color="#00ff00">I think we have to get in there</font>
<font color="#00ff00">and do something with that</font>

99
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,720
<font color="#00ff00">and cos the moths have eaten there,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">his nose is becoming quite...</font>

100
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,880
<font color="#00ff00">..loose and, in fact, there's a</font>
<font color="#00ff00">piece of the stuffing coming out.</font>

101
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,320
<font color="#00ff00">I think we got to Pumpie just</font>
<font color="#00ff00">in time. He's a frail elephant.</font>

102
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,920
<font color="#00ff00">And you have to remember,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">he's 120 years old now.</font>

103
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,760
<font color="#00ff00">Nothing that he was made of was</font>
<font color="#00ff00">designed to last that long.</font>

104
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,800
<font color="#00ffff">I've never seen Pumpie undressed</font>
<font color="#00ffff">before, so this is actually,</font>

105
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,840
<font color="#00ffff">strange as it is to say,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">quite an exciting moment for me.</font>

106
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,240
<font color="#00ffff">It's nice to learn a bit</font>
<font color="#00ffff">more about him.</font>

107
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:11,000
<font color="#00ff00">There we go, here come the trousers.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Oh! </font><font color="#00ffff">He's got a tail!</font>

108
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,160
<font color="#00ff00">Who knew?!</font>

109
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,720
<font color="#00ffff">What a difference in colour</font>
<font color="#00ffff">between his head and his body.</font>

110
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,880
<font color="#00ff00">Yeah, it's a combination</font>
<font color="#00ff00">of light damage and fingers.</font>

111
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,280
<font color="#00ff00">And there's quite a big hole there.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah.</font>

112
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,880
<font color="#00ff00">Which is bigger than I thought.</font>

113
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,400
<font color="#00ffff">It's funny, seeing Pumpie underneath</font>
<font color="#00ffff">these bright studio lights,</font>

114
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,920
<font color="#00ffff">he actually looks a lot worse.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">He does, doesn't he?</font>

115
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,160
<font color="#00ffff">It makes me worry</font>
<font color="#00ffff">a little bit more about him.</font>

116
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:39,160
<font color="#00ff00">Moths. What are we</font>
<font color="#00ff00">going to do, eh? </font><font color="#00ffff">Mm.</font>

117
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,720
<font color="#ffffff">Bringing objects back to life</font>
<font color="#ffffff">calls for more than just</font>

118
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,520
<font color="#ffffff">painstaking conservation work.</font>

119
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,920
<font color="#ffffff">Sometimes, an object</font>
<font color="#ffffff">is not what it seems</font>

120
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,160
<font color="#ffffff">and curators have to turn detective.</font>

121
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,880
<font color="#ffffff">Portrait specialist Charlotte</font>
<font color="#ffffff">has become fascinated by one</font>

122
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,520
<font color="#ffffff">enigmatic piece in particular.</font>

123
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,760
<font color="#ffff00">One of my favourite objects that</font>
<font color="#ffff00">we have in the collection is</font>

124
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:15,560
<font color="#ffff00">this amazing 17th-century watch</font>
<font color="#ffff00">case that, in the 18th century,</font>

125
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,400
<font color="#ffff00">the top has kind of been lopped off,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">the clock's been taken out</font>

126
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,160
<font color="#ffff00">and it's been</font>
<font color="#ffff00">turned into a snuff box.</font>

127
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,760
<font color="#ffff00">And a lid has been affixed to it</font>

128
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:28,080
<font color="#ffff00">that has the miniatures</font>
<font color="#ffff00">of two people.</font>

129
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,120
<font color="#ffffff">But this tiny painting</font>
<font color="#ffffff">wasn't intended to be</font>

130
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,480
<font color="#ffffff">the lid of a snuff box.</font>

131
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,720
<font color="#ffffff">It began life as</font>
<font color="#ffffff">a portrait miniature...</font>

132
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,800
<font color="#ffffff">..a type of 18th-century keepsake.</font>

133
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,560
<font color="#ffff00">Portrait miniatures</font>
<font color="#ffff00">are very personal objects.</font>

134
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,960
<font color="#ffff00">In a time before photography</font>

135
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,560
<font color="#ffff00">when you don't have your</font>
<font color="#ffff00">smartphone, you don't have</font>

136
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,880
<font color="#ffff00">thousands of images of the people</font>
<font color="#ffff00">that are important in your life,</font>

137
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,800
<font color="#ffff00">these objects could be something</font>
<font color="#ffff00">that you could take with you.</font>

138
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,480
<font color="#ffff00">How you would kind of, you know,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">show somebody your Instagram,</font>

139
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,240
<font color="#ffff00">you could take your portrait</font>
<font color="#ffff00">miniature out of your pocket</font>

140
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,440
<font color="#ffff00">and show them the person</font>
<font color="#ffff00">that meant something to you.</font>

141
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:10,720
<font color="#ffffff">But this portrait miniature</font>
<font color="#ffffff">has a question at its heart.</font>

142
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,080
<font color="#ffff00">This object was bought</font>
<font color="#ffff00">in the late 20th century</font>

143
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:19,400
<font color="#ffff00">and we don't have a huge amount</font>
<font color="#ffff00">more information than that.</font>

144
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,320
<font color="#ffff00">We don't have records, we don't</font>
<font color="#ffff00">necessarily know who she is.</font>

145
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,560
<font color="#ffff00">When you don't have that information</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and it's not a particularly</font>

146
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,520
<font color="#ffff00">famous person, their identity</font>
<font color="#ffff00">can kind of just slip away.</font>

147
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,200
<font color="#ffff00">And that's something that</font>
<font color="#ffff00">I really want to investigate</font>

148
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,280
<font color="#ffff00">and kind of find out</font>
<font color="#ffff00">more about who she is.</font>

149
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,600
<font color="#ffffff">If Charlotte can establish</font>
<font color="#ffffff">the mystery woman's identity,</font>

150
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:45,440
<font color="#ffffff">she hopes to feature her in</font>
<font color="#ffffff">a new book all about the V&A's</font>

151
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,000
<font color="#ffffff">glittering Gilbert Collection</font>
<font color="#ffffff">of portrait miniatures.</font>

152
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,840
<font color="#ffff00">Here we are. OK.</font>

153
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,800
<font color="#ffffff">Enamel portraits were</font>
<font color="#ffffff">the must-have fashion</font>

154
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,080
<font color="#ffffff">accessory of the 18th century,</font>

155
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,560
<font color="#ffffff">often worn on a ribbon</font>
<font color="#ffffff">or as part of a bracelet.</font>

156
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,280
<font color="#ffff00">So let's do the big</font>
<font color="#ffff00">guys first, actually. </font><font color="#00ffff">OK.</font>

157
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,920
<font color="#ffff00">And see how that goes.</font>

158
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,840
<font color="#ffffff">They became so popular that the best</font>
<font color="#ffffff">artists had waiting lists of months.</font>

159
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,720
<font color="#ffff00">Portraiture was a huge thing.</font>

160
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,560
<font color="#ffff00">Everybody wanted to have their</font>
<font color="#ffff00">portraits made by the most</font>

161
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,320
<font color="#ffff00">fashionable artist.</font>

162
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,200
<font color="#ffff00">And there are people in the 18th</font>
<font color="#ffff00">century that write about going</font>

163
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,120
<font color="#ffff00">out for breakfast to a pleasure</font>
<font color="#ffff00">garden with some friends</font>

164
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,480
<font color="#ffff00">and then going to sit for</font>
<font color="#ffff00">an enamel portrait miniaturist,</font>

165
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,880
<font color="#ffff00">with their friends, before going</font>
<font color="#ffff00">to another pleasure garden.</font>

166
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,480
<font color="#ffff00">They're really a part of</font>
<font color="#ffff00">kind of elite London life.</font>

167
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:38,080
<font color="#ffffff">The pocket-size portraits were</font>
<font color="#ffffff">often exchanged by lovers,</font>

168
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,960
<font color="#ffffff">or worn like a badge to</font>
<font color="#ffffff">demonstrate your loyalties.</font>

169
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,920
<font color="#ffff00">The stories that you unearth</font>
<font color="#ffff00">that these objects played</font>

170
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:51,000
<font color="#ffff00">a part in can be incredibly</font>
<font color="#ffff00">emotional and incredibly powerful.</font>

171
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,880
<font color="#ffff00">But if we don't have</font>
<font color="#ffff00">that information,</font>

172
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,760
<font color="#ffff00">that's the kind of thing we're</font>
<font color="#ffff00">trying to find out, so we can</font>

173
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,160
<font color="#ffff00">really kind of place the object in</font>
<font color="#ffff00">the history of that sitter's life.</font>

174
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,600
<font color="#ffffff">While the stories of some objects</font>
<font color="#ffffff">in the museum are still being</font>

175
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,120
<font color="#ffffff">uncovered, others need</font>
<font color="#ffffff">no introduction.</font>

176
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:19,440
<font color="#ffffff">The V&A is staging a new exhibition</font>
<font color="#ffffff">of over 170 dresses</font>

177
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,120
<font color="#ffffff">by legendary designer</font>
<font color="#ffffff">Christian Dior.</font>

178
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,320
<font color="#ffffff">But before going on display,</font>
<font color="#ffffff">each and every gown must first be</font>

179
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:38,600
<font color="#ffffff">primped and preened by the</font>
<font color="#ffffff">V&A's doyenne of dresses, Lara.</font>

180
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,560
<font color="#ffff00">They are the stuff of dreams,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">aren't they?</font>

181
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,320
<font color="#ffff00">I mean, you can imagine</font>
<font color="#ffff00">yourself wearing this.</font>

182
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,480
<font color="#ffff00">There's a sort of element</font>
<font color="#ffff00">of fantasy about them.</font>

183
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,520
<font color="#ffff00">We've got one that was designed</font>
<font color="#ffff00">for Nicole Kidman, Emma Watson</font>

184
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:55,480
<font color="#ffff00">at the back, Natalie Portman</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and, of course, Rihanna.</font>

185
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:59,520
<font color="#ffffff">Two more dresses are about</font>
<font color="#ffffff">to be added to the show -</font>

186
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,720
<font color="#ffffff">if Lara can get them ready in time.</font>

187
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,480
<font color="#ffff00">This is a huge exhibition</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and, actually,</font>

188
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,440
<font color="#ffff00">though people don't realise it,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">there's an enormous amount of work</font>

189
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,560
<font color="#ffff00">involved in simply dressing</font>
<font color="#ffff00">these costumes onto the mannequins</font>

190
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,960
<font color="#ffff00">because they all need shaping,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">customising to fit the costumes</font>

191
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:17,960
<font color="#ffff00">and they need help to bring them to</font>
<font color="#ffff00">life in this very static situation.</font>

192
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:24,600
<font color="#ffffff">Lara works with a crack team of</font>
<font color="#ffffff">Britain's sharpest seamstresses,</font>

193
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,560
<font color="#ffffff">here in the V&A's textiles studio.</font>

194
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,760
<font color="#00ffff">Are we ready to have a look...?</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Have a look, yeah. Absolutely.</font>

195
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,920
<font color="#00ffff">Let me just take this lid off.</font>

196
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:36,520
<font color="#ffffff">Curator Oriole has</font>
<font color="#ffffff">exhumed two vintage</font>

197
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,360
<font color="#ffffff">dresses from the museum's stores.</font>

198
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,960
<font color="#00ffff">These are the two dresses</font>
<font color="#00ffff">that will be going</font>

199
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:47,600
<font color="#00ffff">into the Dior In Britain</font>
<font color="#00ffff">section in the exhibition.</font>

200
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:52,480
<font color="#ffffff">It's down to Lara to breathe new</font>
<font color="#ffffff">life into these garments that</font>

201
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,200
<font color="#ffffff">had lain undisturbed</font>
<font color="#ffffff">in the stores for decades.</font>

202
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:01,480
<font color="#ffffff">The first is a raspberry pink</font>
<font color="#ffffff">cocktail dress with</font>

203
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:06,160
<font color="#ffffff">an off-the-shoulder neckline,</font>
<font color="#ffffff">four layers of net petticoats,</font>

204
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,760
<font color="#ffffff">and a bouffant skirt, designed</font>
<font color="#ffffff">to show off a cinched-in waist.</font>

205
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,560
<font color="#ffffff">The dress belonged to Pamela Mann,</font>

206
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,720
<font color="#ffffff">whose husband was physician to</font>
<font color="#ffffff">the Royal household in the 1950s.</font>

207
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,160
<font color="#ffff00">I ordered the figures</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and they're here now,</font>

208
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,040
<font color="#ffff00">so we could actually try them on.</font>

209
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,920
<font color="#ffffff">Most of Dior's dresses were made</font>
<font color="#ffffff">for very individual women.</font>

210
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,840
<font color="#ffff00">Are we centred at the front?</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah, mm-hm.</font>

211
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:37,520
<font color="#ffff00">You start with a mannequin, but</font>
<font color="#ffff00">it's how you turn that mannequin</font>

212
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:43,480
<font color="#ffff00">into a person that is the right</font>
<font color="#ffff00">shape and size for this object.</font>

213
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:47,560
<font color="#ffffff">So now Lara must replicate the</font>
<font color="#ffffff">bodies of the women who once</font>

214
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,920
<font color="#ffffff">wore them, as they were then.</font>

215
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,200
<font color="#ffff00">It's dropping, is it? </font><font color="#00ffff">Yeah.</font>

216
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,000
<font color="#ffff00">So I don't think it will</font>
<font color="#ffff00">hold on its own.</font>

217
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,240
<font color="#ffff00">From my point of view,</font>

218
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,760
<font color="#ffff00">I'm actually recreating bodies that</font>
<font color="#ffff00">wore these things,</font>

219
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,880
<font color="#ffff00">and sometimes you can hardly believe</font>

220
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,880
<font color="#ffff00">that their body shapes</font>
<font color="#ffff00">really were the way they are.</font>

221
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,320
<font color="#ffff00">Got lots of layers,</font>

222
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,080
<font color="#ffff00">but they've become quite</font>
<font color="#ffff00">soft and droopy over time</font>

223
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,240
<font color="#ffff00">and in order to get it looking</font>
<font color="#ffff00">how it should have looked,</font>

224
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,360
<font color="#ffff00">we need to give it some help.</font>

225
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,560
<font color="#00ffff">We do present Lara with</font>
<font color="#00ffff">some tricky conundrums.</font>

226
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,280
<font color="#00ffff">But Lara and her team</font>
<font color="#00ffff">are incredibly skilled</font>

227
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:30,280
<font color="#00ffff">and the whole idea behind her work</font>
<font color="#00ffff">is that it is invisible, that</font>

228
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,920
<font color="#00ffff">people don't think about</font>
<font color="#00ffff">the figure underneath the dress</font>

229
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,760
<font color="#00ffff">and that they just focus</font>
<font color="#00ffff">on the dress itself,</font>

230
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,280
<font color="#00ffff">and focus on the artistry</font>
<font color="#00ffff">and the craft</font>

231
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,840
<font color="#00ffff">and the skill of the makers</font>
<font color="#00ffff">of that garment.</font>

232
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:47,160
<font color="#ffffff">The second outfit is</font>
<font color="#ffffff">a pencil-skirted day dress, with a</font>

233
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:51,600
<font color="#ffffff">masterful series of diagonal pleats</font>
<font color="#ffffff">that once created a slinky</font>

234
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,880
<font color="#ffffff">hourglass silhouette.</font>

235
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,880
<font color="#ffffff">It was owned by the '40s</font>
<font color="#ffffff">film star Martita Hunt,</font>

236
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,920
<font color="#ffffff">whose dresses were donated</font>
<font color="#ffffff">to the V&A when she died.</font>

237
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:07,920
<font color="#ffff00">This is quite a challenge, actually.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Because it's for a tall person,</font>

238
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,400
<font color="#ffff00">we're going to need to make the</font>
<font color="#ffff00">figure with a much longer body and</font>

239
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:17,640
<font color="#ffff00">we're also going to need to do some</font>
<font color="#ffff00">work to make that waist look small.</font>

240
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,680
<font color="#ffff00">It needs to look</font>
<font color="#ffff00">beautifully statuesque.</font>

241
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:26,000
<font color="#ffffff">Lara's efforts aren't just going</font>
<font color="#ffffff">to be admired by the public.</font>

242
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,480
<font color="#ffffff">Pamela Mann will be coming to see</font>
<font color="#ffffff">her pink dress go on display.</font>

243
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,600
<font color="#ffff00">People know what these</font>
<font color="#ffff00">dresses should look like,</font>

244
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,880
<font color="#ffff00">so we have to get it right.</font>

245
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,080
<font color="#ffffff">In the paintings workshop,</font>

246
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:48,360
<font color="#ffffff">Charlotte has given Alan the job of</font>
<font color="#ffffff">taking the golden snuff box apart.</font>

247
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,600
<font color="#00ffff">This is quite a tricky</font>
<font color="#00ffff">object to open.</font>

248
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,760
<font color="#00ffff">There's no obvious way to get at it,</font>

249
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,400
<font color="#00ffff">but I think it's probably what</font>
<font color="#00ffff">I would call a rolled edge fitting.</font>

250
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:02,880
<font color="#00ffff">The metal rim is burnished over</font>
<font color="#00ffff">the cover glass to hold it in place.</font>

251
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,840
<font color="#00ffff">So to take it out,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">we have to reverse that process.</font>

252
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:13,120
<font color="#ffffff">The portrait has been sealed up</font>
<font color="#ffffff">for almost 300 years.</font>

253
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,440
<font color="#ffffff">Now they're hoping to</font>
<font color="#ffffff">discover a clue to the</font>

254
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,560
<font color="#ffffff">identity of the unknown</font>
<font color="#ffffff">woman inside.</font>

255
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:23,320
<font color="#ffff00">Some of the enamels really helpfully</font>
<font color="#ffff00">have the names of the sitter</font>

256
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:27,120
<font color="#ffff00">and the dates and the name of</font>
<font color="#ffff00">the artist literally forged onto</font>

257
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,280
<font color="#ffff00">the back, and so it</font>
<font color="#ffff00">will be there forever.</font>

258
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:34,600
<font color="#ffffff">Enamel portrait miniatures were</font>
<font color="#ffffff">complicated and costly to make.</font>

259
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,360
<font color="#ffff00">The artists go to great lengths to</font>
<font color="#ffff00">create these amazing textures of</font>

260
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:42,160
<font color="#ffff00">silk, or velvet, or fur, or pearls,</font>

261
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,320
<font color="#ffff00">alongside beautifully</font>
<font color="#ffff00">rendered hair, or skin.</font>

262
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,920
<font color="#ffff00">You know that the person's</font>
<font color="#ffff00">going to be wealthy, you know</font>

263
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,200
<font color="#ffff00">that they're going to be</font>
<font color="#ffff00">from the elite of society</font>

264
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,720
<font color="#ffff00">because these objects</font>
<font color="#ffff00">were so expensive.</font>

265
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,840
<font color="#ffffff">Enamel portrait miniatures were</font>
<font color="#ffffff">complicated and costly to make.</font>

266
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:00,800
<font color="#ffffff">These intricate, detailed faces</font>
<font color="#ffffff">were hand-painted onto a fine</font>

267
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:05,720
<font color="#ffffff">sheet of gold or copper, often no</font>
<font color="#ffffff">bigger than five centimetres wide.</font>

268
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,720
<font color="#ffffff">The enamel paint was</font>
<font color="#ffffff">made from ground glass,</font>

269
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,320
<font color="#ffffff">mixed with metal oxides and oil</font>
<font color="#ffffff">to create different colours.</font>

270
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,600
<font color="#ffffff">Each colour was then painted</font>
<font color="#ffffff">separately in tiny dots</font>

271
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,760
<font color="#ffffff">and fired in a kiln at its own</font>
<font color="#ffffff">specific temperature,</font>

272
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:22,280
<font color="#ffffff">slowly building up</font>
<font color="#ffffff">the image with each firing.</font>

273
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:26,960
<font color="#ffff00">It's hugely complicated</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and every time the enamel plaque</font>

274
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,840
<font color="#ffff00">goes into the kiln,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">there's a risk that it'll crack.</font>

275
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,480
<font color="#ffff00">So it's a really</font>
<font color="#ffff00">kind of risky technique.</font>

276
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,480
<font color="#00ffff">Ah, there we go.</font>

277
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,200
<font color="#00ffff">Let's just have a quick look.</font>

278
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:46,440
<font color="#ffffff">Having prised the snuff box apart,</font>
<font color="#ffffff">Alan can take a closer look.</font>

279
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,800
<font color="#00ffff">One of the joys of working with</font>
<font color="#00ffff">miniatures is, of course,</font>

280
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,360
<font color="#00ffff">you're never quite sure</font>
<font color="#00ffff">what you're going to find.</font>

281
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,560
<font color="#00ffff">There may be a signature, there</font>
<font color="#00ffff">may be an inscription, there may</font>

282
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,640
<font color="#00ffff">be a clue to the identity of the</font>
<font color="#00ffff">sitter or the artist, or both.</font>

283
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,200
<font color="#00ffff">There may be a lock</font>
<font color="#00ffff">of hair in there,</font>

284
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,640
<font color="#00ffff">which perhaps belonged to</font>
<font color="#00ffff">the person who's been painted.</font>

285
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,880
<font color="#ffffff">But the lady isn't giving up</font>
<font color="#ffffff">her secrets today.</font>

286
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,160
<font color="#00ffff">In this case, it's a little</font>
<font color="#00ffff">bit disappointing</font>

287
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,040
<font color="#00ffff">because there isn't an inscription.</font>

288
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,680
<font color="#00ffff">So we don't know who the sitter was.</font>

289
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,000
<font color="#ffffff">Charlotte's reached a dead end.</font>

290
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,120
<font color="#ffffff">She needs to throw the net wider,</font>
<font color="#ffffff">looking for portraits</font>

291
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:29,040
<font color="#ffffff">of society ladies of the time</font>
<font color="#ffffff">to see if she can find a match.</font>

292
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,840
<font color="#ffff00">So I searched and found this lady,</font>

293
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:39,040
<font color="#ffff00">who I think is of a compelling</font>
<font color="#ffff00">likeness to this miniature.</font>

294
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:42,720
<font color="#ffff00">And that lady was</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Lady Frances Carteret.</font>

295
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,120
<font color="#ffffff">She's tracked down several</font>
<font color="#ffffff">portraits of an aristocrat</font>

296
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:50,320
<font color="#ffffff">from the earlier 18th century -</font>
<font color="#ffffff">Lady Frances Carteret.</font>

297
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,000
<font color="#ffff00">There's some kind of crossover</font>
<font color="#ffff00">going on with these images.</font>

298
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,440
<font color="#ffff00">And that, to me, kind of</font>
<font color="#ffff00">makes a really compelling</font>

299
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,240
<font color="#ffff00">case that they seem like</font>
<font color="#ffff00">they must be all the same woman.</font>

300
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,960
<font color="#ffffff">Charlotte will have to get</font>
<font color="#ffffff">a closer look at</font>

301
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,560
<font color="#ffffff">the original painting</font>
<font color="#ffffff">to confirm her hunch.</font>

302
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,880
<font color="#ffff00">Want to carry on going</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and putting those pieces together</font>

303
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,560
<font color="#ffff00">so you can tell a full story.</font>

304
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,240
<font color="#ffffff">Every day there are dozens of</font>
<font color="#ffffff">different objects</font>

305
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,560
<font color="#ffffff">on the operating table...</font>

306
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,840
<font color="#ffffff">..receiving the very best</font>
<font color="#ffffff">care available.</font>

307
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,480
<font color="#ffffff">Pumpie, the elderly elephant,</font>
<font color="#ffffff">has arrived in triage for toys,</font>

308
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,640
<font color="#ffffff">the workshop of conservator Jo.</font>

309
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,240
<font color="#00ffff">Getting these folds,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">this is the sort of area</font>

310
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,720
<font color="#00ffff">that moths like - they like folds.</font>

311
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,840
<font color="#ffffff">Jo starts with the most</font>
<font color="#ffffff">pressing problem -</font>

312
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:48,880
<font color="#ffffff">removing any sign of the moths</font>
<font color="#ffffff">that have caused so much damage.</font>

313
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,840
<font color="#00ffff">There's one, look, on his ear.</font>

314
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,080
<font color="#00ffff">That's typical of moth damage.</font>

315
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,720
<font color="#ffffff">Over the years, eager hands</font>
<font color="#ffffff">have pulled Pumpie's feet apart</font>

316
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,080
<font color="#ffffff">at the seams.</font>

317
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,440
<font color="#ffffff">And Jo has found evidence</font>
<font color="#ffffff">of past repairs.</font>

318
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,640
<font color="#00ffff">His paws have been made</font>
<font color="#00ffff">out of recycled gloves.</font>

319
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,280
<font color="#00ffff">I think these are a pair of</font>
<font color="#00ffff">20th-century ladies kid gloves.</font>

320
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,360
<font color="#00ffff">They're very, very thin leather.</font>

321
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:17,320
<font color="#ffffff">Jo uses a curved needle to preserve</font>
<font color="#ffffff">the original stitching holes,</font>

322
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,120
<font color="#ffffff">made over 100 years ago.</font>

323
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,760
<font color="#00ffff">When you're handling</font>
<font color="#00ffff">an old handmade object</font>

324
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:28,560
<font color="#00ffff">that's been made specifically</font>
<font color="#00ffff">by someone for someone else</font>

325
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,280
<font color="#00ffff">there's a much more</font>
<font color="#00ffff">personal connection</font>

326
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,040
<font color="#00ffff">because it wasn't made in a factory,</font>

327
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,680
<font color="#00ffff">and it is different.</font>

328
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,480
<font color="#ffffff">Very little is known about</font>
<font color="#ffffff">the five Cattley children</font>

329
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,920
<font color="#ffffff">for whom Pumpie was originally made.</font>

330
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,680
<font color="#ffffff">One person who's keen to find out</font>
<font color="#ffffff">more is a relative, Emma.</font>

331
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,440
<font color="#ffffff">She's a genealogist, and has been</font>
<font color="#ffffff">looking into her family history.</font>

332
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,840
<font color="#ffff00">We've got a picture of my great</font>
<font color="#ffff00">grandfather and his brother,</font>

333
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,360
<font color="#ffff00">who was the father</font>
<font color="#ffff00">of all the Cattley children.</font>

334
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,560
<font color="#ffff00">They were all born out in Russia</font>

335
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,760
<font color="#ffff00">because their father, James,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">he was a merchant out there.</font>

336
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,280
<font color="#ffff00">And then they came back to Ealing,</font>

337
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,960
<font color="#ffff00">where their father built the house</font>
<font color="#ffff00">that they then lived in,</font>

338
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,560
<font color="#ffff00">and that's where they spent</font>
<font color="#ffff00">their very happy childhood.</font>

339
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,200
<font color="#ffffff">But none of the Cattley children</font>
<font color="#ffffff">ever married,</font>

340
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,160
<font color="#ffffff">leaving Pumpie with no-one</font>
<font color="#ffffff">to play with.</font>

341
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,800
<font color="#ffffff">So he was donated</font>
<font color="#ffffff">to the museum in 1978</font>

342
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,360
<font color="#ffffff">by the last surviving sibling,</font>
<font color="#ffffff">Maude.</font>

343
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,160
<font color="#ffff00">I've only seen Pumpie as a picture.</font>

344
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,360
<font color="#ffff00">I've never had the chance</font>
<font color="#ffff00">to meet him.</font>

345
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,720
<font color="#ffff00">I'm hoping that Pumpie might be</font>
<font color="#ffff00">a little bit of a window into Maude</font>

346
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,680
<font color="#ffff00">and her brothers and sisters,</font>

347
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:43,120
<font color="#ffff00">and how they lived their lives,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and what life was like for them.</font>

348
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,160
<font color="#ffffff">Some of the hardest objects</font>
<font color="#ffffff">to preserve</font>

349
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,920
<font color="#ffffff">are those made from paper.</font>

350
00:20:55,920 --> 00:21:01,320
<font color="#ffffff">Books curator Katherine is in charge</font>
<font color="#ffffff">of a relic from 150 years ago.</font>

351
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:06,400
<font color="#00ffff">So we're going to judge them</font>
<font color="#00ffff">initially by their cover.</font>

352
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,400
<font color="#ffffff">A collection of over 360</font>
<font color="#ffffff">Victorian curiosities</font>

353
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,280
<font color="#ffffff">called peep shows.</font>

354
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,200
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, that's...that's lovely.</font>

355
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,960
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, that's really lovely.</font>

356
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,320
<font color="#ffffff">She wants to choose one</font>
<font color="#ffffff">robust enough to go on display.</font>

357
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,560
<font color="#00ffff">Paper peep shows are made</font>
<font color="#00ffff">of a front panel, a back panel,</font>

358
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:28,360
<font color="#00ffff">and then there's bellows</font>
<font color="#00ffff">in between with various</font>

359
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:31,640
<font color="#00ffff">cut-out panels, and then</font>
<font color="#00ffff">once you expand them,</font>

360
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,520
<font color="#00ffff">you get the full view.</font>

361
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:41,400
<font color="#00ffff">It's a bit like the virtual</font>
<font color="#00ffff">reality of the 19th century.</font>

362
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,880
<font color="#00ffff">I love this one.</font>

363
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,680
<font color="#00ffff">It's colourful, and you get the</font>
<font color="#00ffff">actual Crystal Palace on the front.</font>

364
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,520
<font color="#ffffff">Catherine has settled on</font>
<font color="#ffffff">a paper peep show that captures</font>

365
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,640
<font color="#ffffff">one of the high points</font>
<font color="#ffffff">of the Victorian age.</font>

366
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,160
<font color="#ffffff">The Great Exhibition of 1851.</font>

367
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,960
<font color="#ffffff">This spectacular showcase of art</font>
<font color="#ffffff">and design from across Britain</font>

368
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:09,200
<font color="#ffffff">and the Empire was also a grand</font>
<font color="#ffffff">day out for millions of visitors.</font>

369
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,040
<font color="#00ffff">I love the colours.</font>

370
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,880
<font color="#00ffff">I like the fact that you can</font>
<font color="#00ffff">actually identify</font>

371
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,600
<font color="#00ffff">some of the things</font>
<font color="#00ffff">that are on display.</font>

372
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:23,600
<font color="#00ffff">You can see also</font>
<font color="#00ffff">the diversity of the visitors.</font>

373
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,600
<font color="#ffffff">Paper peep shows were commemorative</font>
<font color="#ffffff">souvenirs sold at famous sites</font>

374
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,040
<font color="#ffffff">or big events for a shilling each,</font>
<font color="#ffffff">or £5 today.</font>

375
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,040
<font color="#00ffff">All of these would have been</font>
<font color="#00ffff">hand-painted because</font>

376
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:38,160
<font color="#00ffff">printing in colour</font>
<font color="#00ffff">was really challenging.</font>

377
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,720
<font color="#00ffff">It was not really widespread</font>
<font color="#00ffff">at that point.</font>

378
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:45,200
<font color="#ffffff">The peep shows were mass produced</font>
<font color="#ffffff">from simple materials</font>

379
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,400
<font color="#ffffff">that magically recreated</font>
<font color="#ffffff">an event in kaleidoscopic 3D.</font>

380
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,280
<font color="#00ffff">And this is...loose,</font>

381
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,760
<font color="#00ffff">so that will need to be repaired.</font>

382
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:58,440
<font color="#00ffff">There'll be a little bit</font>
<font color="#00ffff">of conservation to do,</font>

383
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,720
<font color="#00ffff">but...shall we keep this one</font>
<font color="#00ffff">in then?</font>

384
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,640
<font color="#ffff00">Yes.</font>

385
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,960
<font color="#ffffff">But the fragile 150-year-old</font>
<font color="#ffffff">paper and cardboard</font>

386
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,520
<font color="#ffffff">is showing signs of wear and tear.</font>

387
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:14,840
<font color="#ffffff">If visitors are going to take a peep</font>
<font color="#ffffff">into the past, this memento</font>

388
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:18,760
<font color="#ffffff">needs the help of paper specialist</font>
<font color="#ffffff">Anne.</font>

389
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,840
<font color="#ffff00">So the favourite... </font><font color="#00ffff">Uh-huh.</font>

390
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,680
<font color="#ffff00">You can see... You can see here.</font>

391
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:27,920
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah. </font><font color="#ffff00">You've got some small areas</font>
<font color="#ffff00">that we can re-adhere...</font>

392
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:31,440
<font color="#ffff00">When an object comes</font>
<font color="#ffff00">into the conservation studio,</font>

393
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,760
<font color="#ffff00">we treat it essentially</font>
<font color="#ffff00">as though it's in A&E.</font>

394
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,560
<font color="#ffff00">Do you want to take over?</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Um, yeah. OK.</font>

395
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,560
<font color="#ffff00">I'll grab... </font><font color="#00ffff">Yeah.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">I'll just move that out.</font>

396
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,480
<font color="#ffff00">OK, beautiful.</font>

397
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:49,840
<font color="#ffff00">We will assess to see</font>
<font color="#ffff00">what the ailments actually are,</font>

398
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,160
<font color="#ffff00">what bits are coming away.</font>

399
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,240
<font color="#ffff00">We have a little tear here.</font>

400
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:59,160
<font color="#ffff00">Once we're clear about what's</font>
<font color="#ffff00">really happening to the object,</font>

401
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,000
<font color="#ffff00">or what has happened to the object,</font>

402
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,560
<font color="#ffff00">I will create a treatment plan.</font>

403
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:07,720
<font color="#ffffff">Under Anne's care, the peep show</font>
<font color="#ffffff">will now go through surgery</font>

404
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,600
<font color="#ffffff">to prevent it from</font>
<font color="#ffffff">collapsing altogether.</font>

405
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,200
<font color="#ffff00">It's very fragile,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">it has to be said.</font>

406
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,600
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, that's very beautiful.</font>

407
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,200
<font color="#ffffff">Pumpie the elephant has now</font>
<font color="#ffffff">been in conservation for five weeks,</font>

408
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,880
<font color="#ffffff">and Jo has reached</font>
<font color="#ffffff">the trickiest stage.</font>

409
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,520
<font color="#ffffff">She must match new fabric</font>
<font color="#ffffff">to the faded felt</font>

410
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,200
<font color="#ffffff">of the 100-year-old toy.</font>

411
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,200
<font color="#ffff00">I've not died felt before,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">so I'm sort of going from</font>

412
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,040
<font color="#ffff00">a standing start with this one.</font>

413
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,720
<font color="#ffffff">She makes a bespoke dye recipe,</font>

414
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,440
<font color="#ffffff">mixing four colours -</font>
<font color="#ffffff">grey, blue, brown and orange,</font>

415
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,840
<font color="#ffffff">to get an exact</font>
<font color="#ffffff">match for the faded colour</font>

416
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,120
<font color="#ffffff">of his moth-eaten trunk.</font>

417
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,720
<font color="#ffff00">You have to keep stirring it,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">otherwise you get patchy dye results</font>

418
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,000
<font color="#ffff00">and we are just about there.</font>

419
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,640
<font color="#ffff00">It's just at 90.</font>

420
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,120
<font color="#ffffff">The dye must be heated</font>
<font color="#ffffff">to exactly 95 degrees</font>

421
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,000
<font color="#ffffff">to bond all the colour molecules</font>
<font color="#ffffff">to the fabric.</font>

422
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,240
<font color="#ffff00">It's very frustrating because you</font>
<font color="#ffff00">don't know if you've got the ratios</font>

423
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,760
<font color="#ffff00">right until you've finished, and</font>
<font color="#ffff00">it's an hour and a half</font>

424
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,640
<font color="#ffff00">of your time,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and then you look at your samples</font>

425
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,440
<font color="#ffff00">and none of them are quite right.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">You've got to repeat the process.</font>

426
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,600
<font color="#ffff00">It's not like mixing paint.</font>

427
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,560
<font color="#ffff00">You don't get an instant result.</font>

428
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,560
<font color="#ffff00">There we go.</font>

429
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:33,040
<font color="#ffffff">The new felt is rinsed in</font>
<font color="#ffffff">de-ionised water and left to dry.</font>

430
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,280
<font color="#ffffff">There's no pattern book to follow</font>

431
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,200
<font color="#ffffff">when it comes to this one-off</font>
<font color="#ffffff">home-made toy.</font>

432
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,680
<font color="#ffff00">It's particularly touching to me</font>
<font color="#ffff00">for it to be an elephant</font>

433
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,560
<font color="#ffff00">because I have a knitted</font>
<font color="#ffff00">wool elephant</font>

434
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:49,280
<font color="#ffff00">that was made by my Auntie Winnie</font>
<font color="#ffff00">before I was born.</font>

435
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:52,160
<font color="#ffff00">I still have it,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and it's got moth holes.</font>

436
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,000
<font color="#ffff00">It lives in my bedside drawer.</font>

437
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,040
<font color="#ffffff">Pumpie is one of the last</font>
<font color="#ffffff">of his kind.</font>

438
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:03,280
<font color="#ffffff">Up until the 1900s, soft toys were</font>
<font color="#ffffff">largely made by families at home.</font>

439
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:07,360
<font color="#ffffff">But when the world's first mass</font>
<font color="#ffffff">produced teddy bear was introduced</font>

440
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,400
<font color="#ffffff">by Steiff in Germany in 1903,</font>

441
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,680
<font color="#ffffff">handmade toys like Pumpie</font>
<font color="#ffffff">were left on the shelf.</font>

442
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,600
<font color="#ffffff">After three days of colour dying,</font>

443
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,480
<font color="#ffffff">and waiting patiently</font>
<font color="#ffffff">for each test to dry,</font>

444
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,200
<font color="#ffffff">Jo's finally ready</font>
<font color="#ffffff">to start on the trunk.</font>

445
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,720
<font color="#ffff00">Well, the colour's a good match,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">I think.</font>

446
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,680
<font color="#ffffff">The felt must now be carefully</font>
<font color="#ffffff">patched from the inside</font>

447
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,480
<font color="#ffffff">to disguise the repair.</font>

448
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:41,960
<font color="#ffff00">It's really hard, trying to feed</font>
<font color="#ffff00">that long piece of felt</font>

449
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,960
<font color="#ffff00">in through all those tiny</font>
<font color="#ffff00">little holes.</font>

450
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,920
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, damn.</font>

451
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:49,840
<font color="#ffff00">It's like putting a pair of socks</font>
<font color="#ffff00">on through a letterbox.</font>

452
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,280
<font color="#ffff00">You have to be very careful</font>
<font color="#ffff00">when you're dealing</font>

453
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,840
<font color="#ffff00">with objects of that age.</font>

454
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,640
<font color="#ffff00">They're very easy to damage.</font>

455
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,440
<font color="#ffff00">You have to weigh up</font>
<font color="#ffff00">the potential damage</font>

456
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,520
<font color="#ffff00">against the potential to</font>
<font color="#ffff00">extend its life.</font>

457
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,240
<font color="#ffff00">There we go.</font>

458
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,920
<font color="#ffff00">Move that up...</font>

459
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,760
<font color="#ffff00">That's looking better, isn't it?</font>

460
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:15,520
<font color="#ffffff">Pumpie's admiral's outfit</font>
<font color="#ffffff">has also been made shipshape,</font>

461
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,400
<font color="#ffffff">with polished buttons</font>
<font color="#ffffff">and repaired cuffs.</font>

462
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,640
<font color="#ffff00">There's a great sense of</font>
<font color="#ffff00">satisfaction when you've finished</font>

463
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:27,360
<font color="#ffff00">conserving an object, and you know</font>
<font color="#ffff00">it's in the best possible condition</font>

464
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,040
<font color="#ffff00">it could be to go forward...</font>

465
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,880
<font color="#ffff00">I'm pleased with that.</font>

466
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,560
<font color="#ffff00">..and that other children</font>
<font color="#ffff00">will look at him and understand</font>

467
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,280
<font color="#ffff00">the way he was played with,</font>

468
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,680
<font color="#ffff00">the way they drag their teddy</font>
<font color="#ffff00">around by the foot, it's the same.</font>

469
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,360
<font color="#ffff00">Children don't change.</font>

470
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,240
<font color="#ffff00">They're the same</font>
<font color="#ffff00">now as they were in 1906.</font>

471
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:52,400
<font color="#ffffff">Treasures from today</font>
<font color="#ffffff">also have a home at the V&A.</font>

472
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,160
<font color="#ffffff">But even they require special care.</font>

473
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,200
<font color="#00ffff">Amazing. Tiny.</font>

474
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:05,360
<font color="#00ffff">It's not a case</font>
<font color="#00ffff">of putting it in a case,</font>

475
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,200
<font color="#00ffff">and putting it on display</font>
<font color="#00ffff">and, you know, all done.</font>

476
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,760
<font color="#00ffff">Each object is looked after</font>
<font color="#00ffff">in the condition</font>

477
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,600
<font color="#00ffff">that means that people</font>
<font color="#00ffff">will be able to look at it</font>

478
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,520
<font color="#00ffff">in hundreds of years from now.</font>

479
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,320
<font color="#00ffff">Pair of beige diamante peep-toe,</font>

480
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,840
<font color="#00ffff">with diamante stack heel.</font>

481
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,120
<font color="#00ffff">They're gorgeous.</font>

482
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,720
<font color="#ffffff">In the museum's theatre</font>
<font color="#ffffff">and performance galleries,</font>

483
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,920
<font color="#ffffff">rock and pop curator Vicky,</font>

484
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:32,120
<font color="#ffffff">and conservator Susannah</font>
<font color="#ffffff">are checking the condition</font>

485
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,560
<font color="#ffffff">of one of their more unusual pieces.</font>

486
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:40,200
<font color="#00ffff">This is Kylie's dressing room,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">as seen, and as actually</font>

487
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:44,800
<font color="#00ffff">existed at Wembley in January 2007.</font>

488
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:59,200
<font color="#ffffff">After the tour, Kylie offered</font>
<font color="#ffffff">her entire dressing room</font>

489
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,360
<font color="#ffffff">to the museum on long term loan</font>
<font color="#ffffff">as a time capsule.</font>

490
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,720
<font color="#00ffff">This is the original photograph.</font>

491
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,960
<font color="#00ffff">We went down to her show,</font>

492
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,680
<font color="#00ffff">and were allowed to go to meet</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Kylie in her dressing room,</font>

493
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:16,480
<font color="#00ffff">and took this photograph</font>
<font color="#00ffff">to get a real, authentic feel</font>

494
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,280
<font color="#00ffff">of what it actually looked like.</font>

495
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:21,120
<font color="#00ffff">With that, we were able to kind of</font>

496
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,680
<font color="#00ffff">evoke the feel</font>
<font color="#00ffff">of Kylie's dressing room.</font>

497
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,440
<font color="#00ffff">What I saw was a real person.</font>

498
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:31,680
<font color="#00ffff">She's a real person with,</font>

499
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,360
<font color="#00ffff">you know, messy shoes on the floor,</font>

500
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:38,320
<font color="#00ffff">the costumes hanging up, things that</font>
<font color="#00ffff">looked like they'd been pulled out</font>

501
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,360
<font color="#00ffff">and then put back again in a hurry.</font>

502
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,800
<font color="#00ffff">As well as this performance story,</font>

503
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,640
<font color="#00ffff">the objects communicated</font>
<font color="#00ffff">that human story.</font>

504
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:51,600
<font color="#ffffff">Once a year, every nook</font>
<font color="#ffffff">and cranny of the dressing room</font>

505
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,160
<font color="#ffffff">and its contents, must be checked</font>
<font color="#ffffff">by hand to make sure</font>

506
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,280
<font color="#ffffff">it's standing the test of time.</font>

507
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:01,600
<font color="#00ffff">So we've got a great list here</font>
<font color="#00ffff">of everything that's in there,</font>

508
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,680
<font color="#00ffff">which is 226 objects.</font>

509
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,760
<font color="#ffff00">OK, so they're very dusty.</font>

510
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:11,160
<font color="#ffff00">It is just surface dust,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">fortunately. </font><font color="#00ffff">This is really dusty.</font>

511
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:17,400
<font color="#ffffff">But inspecting the objects can</font>
<font color="#ffffff">uncover some very personal stories.</font>

512
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,920
<font color="#ffff00">This is quite amazing.</font>

513
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,000
<font color="#ffff00">It's Kylie's curls</font>

514
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,280
<font color="#ffff00">for a final touch</font>
<font color="#ffff00">of her hairstyle.</font>

515
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:29,760
<font color="#00ffff">This performance at the time was</font>
<font color="#00ffff">also an incredibly emotional moment</font>

516
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,640
<font color="#00ffff">because Kylie had been,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">I think, halfway through a tour</font>

517
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,360
<font color="#00ffff">when she'd been diagnosed</font>
<font color="#00ffff">with breast cancer</font>

518
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:39,080
<font color="#00ffff">around 18 months before, and the</font>
<font color="#00ffff">tour had come to an immediate end.</font>

519
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,800
<font color="#00ffff">And this was the</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Showgirl Homecoming Tour,</font>

520
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,720
<font color="#00ffff">so there was such</font>
<font color="#00ffff">a feeling around it,</font>

521
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:49,760
<font color="#00ffff">such an emotion about her being</font>
<font color="#00ffff">back on stage, and being well.</font>

522
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:56,440
<font color="#00ffff">The hairpiece really shows us</font>
<font color="#00ffff">what she had been through.</font>

523
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,240
<font color="#00ffff">And that related to the fact</font>

524
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,600
<font color="#00ffff">that she had come out of</font>
<font color="#00ffff">treatment for cancer.</font>

525
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,800
<font color="#00ffff">She lost her hair,</font>

526
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,880
<font color="#00ffff">but she wanted to show it</font>
<font color="#00ffff">as it was,</font>

527
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,640
<font color="#00ffff">not disguise it with long hair.</font>

528
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,160
<font color="#00ffff">So that's certainly</font>
<font color="#00ffff">what it says to me.</font>

529
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,960
<font color="#00ff00">To my other world.</font>

530
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:20,960
<font color="#ffffff">The hairpiece isn't the only</font>
<font color="#ffffff">poignant item in Kylie's wardrobe.</font>

531
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,240
<font color="#00ffff">It's just adorable.</font>

532
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:28,120
<font color="#00ffff">It says, "To Kylie.</font>

533
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,160
<font color="#00ffff">"Thank you for let me see you.</font>

534
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:34,520
<font color="#00ffff">"You are the best ever pop star.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">From Emily"</font>

535
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:37,480
<font color="#00ffff">There's a lovely big, gold heart.</font>

536
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,520
<font color="#00ffff">I think a lot of people</font>
<font color="#00ffff">think that about Kylie.</font>

537
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,240
<font color="#00ffff">Well, I think that's looking</font>
<font color="#00ffff">much better.</font>

538
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,160
<font color="#ffffff">There are three weeks left before</font>
<font color="#ffffff">the two Dior dresses go on display.</font>

539
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,920
<font color="#ffffff">Lara has asked Lilia</font>
<font color="#ffffff">to restore the sagging splendour</font>

540
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,720
<font color="#ffffff">of the pink cocktail dress.</font>

541
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:17,160
<font color="#ffff00">There's that kind of way</font>
<font color="#ffff00">it needs to slightly lift</font>

542
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,800
<font color="#ffff00">and sit proud of the shoulders,</font>

543
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,920
<font color="#ffff00">which makes the figure look very</font>
<font color="#ffff00">elegant and petite inside it,</font>

544
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:25,400
<font color="#ffff00">because I think it's looking like</font>
<font color="#ffff00">it might have lost some of that</font>

545
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,440
<font color="#ffff00">original oomph to hold it up. </font><font color="#00ffff">Yeah.</font>

546
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,240
<font color="#ffffff">The challenge is to create</font>
<font color="#ffffff">shoulder supports</font>

547
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,480
<font color="#ffffff">that will show off the seductive</font>
<font color="#ffffff">decolletage properly...</font>

548
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
<font color="#ffffff">..and stop a wardrobe malfunction</font>
<font color="#ffffff">in the bust area.</font>

549
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,360
<font color="#ffffff">Lilia is using a polyester fabric</font>
<font color="#ffffff">that contracts</font>

550
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:49,080
<font color="#ffffff">and hardens into shape when heated.</font>

551
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:53,000
<font color="#00ffff">I've just given it the steam</font>
<font color="#00ffff">from the iron,</font>

552
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,760
<font color="#00ffff">and now you can you can see compared</font>
<font color="#00ffff">to before, it's shrunk</font>

553
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,040
<font color="#00ffff">and started to take on the shape</font>
<font color="#00ffff">of the shoulder.</font>

554
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:06,520
<font color="#ffffff">New fabric shoulders are cut to fit</font>
<font color="#ffffff">so the neckline can stand proud...</font>

555
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,680
<font color="#ffffff">..as it would have done</font>
<font color="#ffffff">when it was new, 70 years ago.</font>

556
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:17,560
<font color="#ffffff">Lilia has also found evidence</font>
<font color="#ffffff">of the dress's past life.</font>

557
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:20,680
<font color="#00ffff">What's lovely is when you start to</font>
<font color="#00ffff">kind of notice</font>

558
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:24,200
<font color="#00ffff">signs of wear and signs</font>
<font color="#00ffff">of the life of the object.</font>

559
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,760
<font color="#00ffff">On the pink dress, for example,</font>

560
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:30,200
<font color="#00ffff">there are a few pinpricks</font>
<font color="#00ffff">on the bow on the neckline,</font>

561
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,840
<font color="#00ffff">so that suggests it would</font>
<font color="#00ffff">have been worn with a brooch.</font>

562
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,280
<font color="#00ffff">And then you get the sense</font>
<font color="#00ffff">of how they</font>

563
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,080
<font color="#00ffff">might have styled it and worn it.</font>

564
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:40,800
<font color="#00ffff">That's what's really special</font>
<font color="#00ffff">about working with garments.</font>

565
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:44,040
<font color="#00ffff">They have a story to tell in terms</font>
<font color="#00ffff">of the person who wore them,</font>

566
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,440
<font color="#00ffff">as well as the person</font>
<font color="#00ffff">who designed them.</font>

567
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,240
<font color="#ffffff">The dress was once owned</font>
<font color="#ffffff">by Pamela Man,</font>

568
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,240
<font color="#ffffff">who wore it</font>
<font color="#ffffff">with a very special accessory.</font>

569
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:56,600
<font color="#ffff00">This is the bridge</font>
<font color="#ffff00">that I wore on the bow</font>

570
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,520
<font color="#ffff00">on my Dior dress,</font>

571
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:02,720
<font color="#ffff00">which my husband</font>
<font color="#ffff00">bought me as a surprise.</font>

572
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,960
<font color="#ffff00">We were we were engaged,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">I think, at the time.</font>

573
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,560
<font color="#ffff00">But he was like that.</font>

574
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:10,320
<font color="#ffff00">He would bring me something</font>
<font color="#ffff00">any time.</font>

575
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,000
<font color="#ffff00">And the rubies picked up</font>
<font color="#ffff00">the colour of the dress.</font>

576
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,040
<font color="#ffff00">It was perfect.</font>

577
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,400
<font color="#ffff00">Well, I thought it was, anyway.</font>

578
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,840
<font color="#ffffff">The brooch wasn't the only gift</font>

579
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:25,280
<font color="#ffffff">Pamela's late husband, William,</font>
<font color="#ffffff">bought her.</font>

580
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,720
<font color="#ffffff">He also took her to the</font>
<font color="#ffffff">designer room in Harrods</font>

581
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,480
<font color="#ffffff">to buy the Dior dress.</font>

582
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:35,080
<font color="#ffff00">I felt good in it, but it was</font>
<font color="#ffff00">really my husband who chose it,</font>

583
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,600
<font color="#ffff00">who said, "That is the one!"</font>

584
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:42,760
<font color="#ffff00">He loved colours.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">He loved nice clothes and things.</font>

585
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,880
<font color="#ffff00">But he spent more</font>
<font color="#ffff00">than I would have spent.</font>

586
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,720
<font color="#ffff00">So that was great.</font>

587
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,360
<font color="#ffffff">The glamorous pink cocktail dress</font>

588
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:55,040
<font color="#ffffff">was picked out for</font>
<font color="#ffffff">a special occasion in 1957.</font>

589
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:59,000
<font color="#ffff00">He was a consultant</font>
<font color="#ffff00">general physician at Guys,</font>

590
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,200
<font color="#ffff00">and also had been appointed</font>
<font color="#ffff00">physician to the royal household.</font>

591
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:07,360
<font color="#ffff00">There was a dinner</font>
<font color="#ffff00">at St James's Palace</font>

592
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:10,360
<font color="#ffff00">for all the medical household,</font>

593
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:14,640
<font color="#ffff00">and so it was necessary</font>
<font color="#ffff00">to have quite a grand dress.</font>

594
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,120
<font color="#ffff00">I hadn't been in there before.</font>

595
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,960
<font color="#ffff00">It was all new, but it was lovely.</font>

596
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,560
<font color="#ffff00">I mean, I thoroughly enjoyed it.</font>

597
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,760
<font color="#ffff00">New experiences, meeting new people.</font>

598
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,880
<font color="#ffff00">And I had this beautiful dress.</font>

599
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,320
<font color="#ffff00">I don't think I've ever felt</font>
<font color="#ffff00">like that before, or since.</font>

607

<font color="#00ffff">He loved Britain.</font>

<font color="#ffffff">into a loyal customer for life.</font>

621
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,880
<font color="#ffffff">When Dior you started selling</font>
<font color="#ffffff">his designs in Harrods,</font>

622
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:57,560
<font color="#ffffff">10,000 customers arrived</font>
<font color="#ffffff">in the first week,</font>

623
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:00,960
<font color="#ffffff">hoping to buy a range of</font>
<font color="#ffffff">off-the-peg dresses,</font>

624
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,080
<font color="#ffffff">but a third of the price</font>
<font color="#ffffff">of haute couture,</font>

625
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:07,840
<font color="#ffffff">and Pamela Mann's pink dress</font>
<font color="#ffffff">was one of them.</font>

626
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:11,000
<font color="#ffff00">It's nerve-racking, the idea</font>
<font color="#ffff00">that the actual wearer of the dress</font>

627
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,520
<font color="#ffff00">is going to come and see this one.</font>

628
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:17,720
<font color="#ffff00">I'm worried that it might not</font>
<font color="#ffff00">look how she remembered it.</font>

629
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:21,000
<font color="#ffff00">We might have built her bust up</font>
<font color="#ffff00">way too much,</font>

630
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,960
<font color="#ffff00">or she'll say, "Oh, no, the neckline</font>
<font color="#ffff00">was actually like this..."</font>

631
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,440
<font color="#ffff00">In the end, I hope Pamela is happy.</font>

632
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:35,080
<font color="#ffffff">Making sure objects</font>
<font color="#ffffff">look their best for visitors</font>

633
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:38,400
<font color="#ffffff">can mean hours of painstaking</font>
<font color="#ffffff">work behind the scenes.</font>

634
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,400
<font color="#00ffff">It can be really quite daunting</font>

635
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,480
<font color="#00ffff">if you're doing a process</font>
<font color="#00ffff">that has a risk to it.</font>

636
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,640
<font color="#00ffff">So I think we're quite</font>
<font color="#00ffff">an anxious lot.</font>

637
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:52,040
<font color="#ffff00">You have to be sympathetic</font>
<font color="#ffff00">to the objects you're working on.</font>

638
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,640
<font color="#ffff00">They are very vulnerable.</font>

639
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,920
<font color="#ffff00">And I really don't want</font>
<font color="#ffff00">to be the person</font>

640
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,680
<font color="#ffff00">who's handling it when it breaks.</font>

641
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:01,040
<font color="#ffff00">So you have to be really careful.</font>

642
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,840
<font color="#ffff00">And that's quite nerve-racking.</font>

643
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:15,240
<font color="#ffffff">The extremely delicate</font>
<font color="#ffffff">Victorian peep show</font>

644
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,880
<font color="#ffffff">is now in the paper workshop...</font>

645
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:23,600
<font color="#ffffff">..ready to undergo surgery</font>
<font color="#ffffff">at the hands of conservator Anne.</font>

646
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:27,000
<font color="#00ffff">My whole life is about</font>
<font color="#00ffff">interacting with object</font>

647
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,560
<font color="#00ffff">on an intimate level.</font>

648
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,520
<font color="#00ffff">A lot of the work that we</font>
<font color="#00ffff">work on is incredibly beautiful,</font>

649
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:37,120
<font color="#00ffff">and it's incredible to be that close</font>
<font color="#00ffff">and to actually touch an object.</font>

650
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:41,880
<font color="#00ffff">So I'm just going to start</font>
<font color="#00ffff">with giving it a bit of a clean.</font>

651
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,840
<font color="#ffffff">First, Anne applies a</font>
<font color="#ffffff">dry sponge to lift the dirt.</font>

652
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,920
<font color="#00ffff">To be a good conservator,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">you have to have patience</font>

653
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,360
<font color="#00ffff">and maybe some</font>
<font color="#00ffff">obsessive compulsive disorder.</font>

654
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:00,480
<font color="#00ffff">But it can be quite</font>
<font color="#00ffff">meditative at times as well.</font>

655
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:05,040
<font color="#ffffff">The peep show is constructed</font>
<font color="#ffffff">from a series of separate layers</font>

656
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,080
<font color="#ffffff">of card, all attached</font>
<font color="#ffffff">to a paper concertina.</font>

657
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:12,760
<font color="#ffffff">One card layer has come away</font>
<font color="#ffffff">and needs reattaching.</font>

658
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,280
<font color="#00ffff">The water is creating the line...</font>

659
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:20,360
<font color="#ffffff">To conceal the repair, Anne</font>
<font color="#ffffff">uses water to mark an edge.</font>

660
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,320
<font color="#ffffff">With a bone scalpel,</font>

661
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:28,080
<font color="#ffffff">she scores a precise line,</font>
<font color="#ffffff">creating a feathered tear.</font>

662
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:32,080
<font color="#00ffff">If I just cut it straight, then</font>
<font color="#00ffff">you'd see a harsh line on the back.</font>

663
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,080
<font color="#00ffff">I'm just easing out the fibres now.</font>

664
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,960
<font color="#00ffff">Sometimes a joker can say what</font>
<font color="#00ffff">a conservator does is sticking,</font>

665
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,960
<font color="#00ffff">cutting, colouring and glueing.</font>

666
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,120
<font color="#00ffff">Really what we're doing</font>
<font color="#00ffff">is we're preserving the objects</font>

667
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,600
<font color="#00ffff">for this generation,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">future generations.</font>

668
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,880
<font color="#ffffff">Next, Anne moves</font>
<font color="#ffffff">onto the cardboard case,</font>

669
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,240
<font color="#ffffff">which is starting to come apart,</font>

670
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:09,000
<font color="#ffffff">a problem that</font>
<font color="#ffffff">calls for a special tool.</font>

671
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,120
<font color="#00ffff">I'm going to put in a syringe</font>
<font color="#00ffff">because...I can't get in.</font>

672
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:16,880
<font color="#ffffff">The syringe is filled with</font>
<font color="#ffffff">a natural paste made from wheat</font>

673
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,640
<font color="#ffffff">that is strong</font>
<font color="#ffffff">and mould resistant.</font>

674
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,320
<font color="#00ffff">You are doing something</font>
<font color="#00ffff">that's very risky.</font>

675
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,800
<font color="#00ffff">So you have to be...</font>
<font color="#00ffff">You have to be focused.</font>

676
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,800
<font color="#00ffff">I want to get it underneath</font>
<font color="#00ffff">the surface.</font>

677
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:33,360
<font color="#00ffff">I'm being very mindful on how much</font>
<font color="#00ffff">pressure I'm applying as well.</font>

678
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:36,680
<font color="#00ffff">Any time you come</font>
<font color="#00ffff">into contact with an object,</font>

679
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,680
<font color="#00ffff">you're at risk of</font>
<font color="#00ffff">causing damage to it,</font>

680
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,920
<font color="#00ffff">so you have to handle carefully.</font>

681
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,560
<font color="#ffffff">With the case fixed,</font>
<font color="#ffffff">Anne must repair</font>

682
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:49,200
<font color="#ffffff">a corner of the paper concertina</font>
<font color="#ffffff">that's starting to tear,</font>

683
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,840
<font color="#ffffff">using tiny pieces</font>
<font color="#ffffff">of Japanese tissue paper</font>

684
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,400
<font color="#ffffff">that she has matched</font>
<font color="#ffffff">to the original.</font>

685
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,080
<font color="#00ffff">It's a bit fiddly.</font>

686
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,240
<font color="#00ffff">OK.</font>

687
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,520
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah, now that tear is repaired.</font>

688
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:08,320
<font color="#00ffff">It's adhered well, which means</font>
<font color="#00ffff">the tear isn't going to extend</font>

689
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,880
<font color="#00ffff">any more with handling.</font>

690
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,080
<font color="#00ffff">I have to say, I'm very glad</font>
<font color="#00ffff">that it's done now.</font>

691
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,480
<font color="#ffffff">Now the peep show has been restored,</font>

692
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:22,360
<font color="#ffffff">curator Katherine has come</font>
<font color="#ffffff">to inspect the results</font>

693
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,800
<font color="#ffffff">of the operation.</font>

694
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,200
<font color="#ffff00">Brilliant.</font>

695
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,600
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, it's really great.</font>

696
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,320
<font color="#ffff00">I'm at the Great Exhibition!</font>

697
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,040
<font color="#ffff00">That's what I see.</font>

698
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:35,600
<font color="#ffff00">You can see all the details</font>
<font color="#ffff00">of the clothing of the visitors</font>

699
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,000
<font color="#ffff00">and furniture...</font>

700
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,640
<font color="#ffff00">And this, like, nave</font>
<font color="#ffff00">that seems to never end.</font>

701
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,320
<font color="#ffff00">I love it.</font>

702
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,400
<font color="#ffff00">I think it's really brilliant.</font>

703
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:51,240
<font color="#ffff00">For the first time, this paper</font>
<font color="#ffff00">peep show functions properly.</font>

704
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:56,520
<font color="#ffff00">So now it's as if it had been</font>
<font color="#ffff00">bought yesterday, kind of.</font>

705
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,760
<font color="#ffff00">So you just look through</font>
<font color="#ffff00">the peep hole</font>

706
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:01,880
<font color="#ffff00">and you have the Great Exhibition</font>
<font color="#ffff00">unfold in front of your eyes.</font>

707
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,640
<font color="#ffffff">At Ham House in Surrey,</font>

708
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:17,600
<font color="#ffffff">miniatures curator Charlotte</font>
<font color="#ffffff">has arrived to inspect</font>

709
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:21,480
<font color="#ffffff">a full-sized painting of</font>
<font color="#ffffff">Lady Frances Carteret hanging here.</font>

710
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:27,360
<font color="#ffffff">She's brought a scan of the portrait</font>
<font color="#ffffff">miniature so she can compare them.</font>

711
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:31,560
<font color="#ffff00">I can see some real similarities.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">The face shape is really similar.</font>

712
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:34,800
<font color="#ffff00">Also, this kind of court dress</font>
<font color="#ffff00">that they're wearing,</font>

713
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,960
<font color="#ffff00">and the hair is pretty much</font>
<font color="#ffff00">exactly the same.</font>

714
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:40,560
<font color="#ffff00">You know, even the beauty spot...</font>

715
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,400
<font color="#ffff00">..is there - the shading...</font>

716
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:46,840
<font color="#ffff00">..is there in the same places</font>
<font color="#ffff00">around her face.</font>

717
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,920
<font color="#ffff00">It's so important to be there</font>
<font color="#ffff00">in front of the object</font>

718
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:51,840
<font color="#ffff00">to really be able to see those tiny</font>
<font color="#ffff00">details, because when you're looking</font>

719
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:54,040
<font color="#ffff00">at things digitally,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">you don't always see things.</font>

720
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,800
<font color="#ffff00">You look at things</font>
<font color="#ffff00">in a different way.</font>

721
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:59,080
<font color="#ffff00">So I've seen reproductions of this</font>
<font color="#ffff00">before, but I hadn't noticed</font>

722
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:02,520
<font color="#ffff00">that kind of beauty spot</font>
<font color="#ffff00">in exactly the same place.</font>

723
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:07,080
<font color="#ffffff">In fact, the miniature may have</font>
<font color="#ffffff">been made as a portable replica</font>

724
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:09,280
<font color="#ffffff">of this very painting.</font>

725
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,600
<font color="#ffffff">It was common practice</font>
<font color="#ffffff">in the 18th century</font>

726
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:15,480
<font color="#ffffff">to take small-scale copies of</font>
<font color="#ffffff">family portraits on your travels.</font>

727
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:21,440
<font color="#ffffff">But to be sure, Charlotte wants</font>
<font color="#ffffff">to consult with Ham House curator</font>

728
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:25,240
<font color="#ffffff">Jane, who has another miniature</font>
<font color="#ffffff">which may prove conclusive.</font>

729
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,000
<font color="#ffff00">I know that there's more portraits</font>
<font color="#ffff00">here at Ham</font>

730
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,360
<font color="#ffff00">of Frances, Lady Carteret.</font>

731
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,560
<font color="#ffff00">We've seen the oil</font>
<font color="#ffff00">painting already. </font><font color="#00ffff">Right.</font>

732
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:36,720
<font color="#ffff00">And obviously I'm extra interested</font>
<font color="#ffff00">in any portrait miniatures.</font>

733
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,920
<font color="#ffff00">So I know you have one of her.</font>

734
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,920
<font color="#ffff00">Is this it? </font><font color="#00ffff">It is.</font>

735
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:45,360
<font color="#00ffff">It is. And very excitingly,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">it appears to be exactly</font>

736
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,720
<font color="#00ffff">the same composition as yours. </font><font color="#ffff00">Wow!</font>

737
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:50,440
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah. That is literally</font>
<font color="#ffff00">exactly the same.</font>

738
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:54,840
<font color="#ffffff">Jane's miniature of</font>
<font color="#ffffff">Lady Carteret is a perfect match.</font>

739
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,880
<font color="#00ffff">Gosh, with the same pink shawl.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah.</font>

740
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:02,760
<font color="#00ffff">We've got the same crisscross</font>
<font color="#00ffff">of the pearls on the bodice.</font>

741
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:05,040
<font color="#ffff00">Yes, and exactly the same kind</font>
<font color="#ffff00">of hairstyle.</font>

742
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,240
<font color="#00ffff">The weaving of the hair</font>
<font color="#00ffff">is very similar, isn't it?</font>

743
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:10,640
<font color="#ffff00">Exactly. So I think, you know,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">conclusively we can say this really</font>

744
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,320
<font color="#ffff00">is of the same iconography.</font>

745
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:15,160
<font color="#00ffff">This is the same woman, isn't it?</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, absolutely. </font><font color="#00ffff">Absolutely.</font>

746
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:18,840
<font color="#ffff00">That's very exciting.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">That's very exciting!</font>

747
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:26,000
<font color="#ffffff">Born Frances Worsley, Lady Carteret</font>
<font color="#ffffff">enchanted high society in the 1700s.</font>

748
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:32,520
<font color="#ffffff">She made a good match with Lord</font>
<font color="#ffffff">Carteret, an ambitious politician.</font>

749
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,720
<font color="#ffffff">But life wasn't all</font>
<font color="#ffffff">parties and balls.</font>

750
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,440
<font color="#ffffff">The couple also had six children.</font>

751
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:41,720
<font color="#ffffff">One of whom lived at Ham House,</font>
<font color="#ffffff">which is why</font>

752
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:45,200
<font color="#ffffff">Lady Carteret's</font>
<font color="#ffffff">portrait hangs here.</font>

753
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,040
<font color="#ffff00">Is there anything more that</font>
<font color="#ffff00">you can tell me about her, Jane?</font>

754
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:50,560
<font color="#00ffff">There was an Irish theologian,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Bishop of Dublin,</font>

755
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,720
<font color="#00ffff">called Patrick Delaney,</font>

756
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,960
<font color="#00ffff">who once wrote a poem</font>
<font color="#00ffff">about her, to her -</font>

757
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:58,880
<font color="#00ffff">an apology for failing to turn up</font>
<font color="#00ffff">for a dinner engagement,</font>

758
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:02,480
<font color="#00ffff">but in which he says she has</font>
<font color="#00ffff">a beauty which has no need of art.</font>

759
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,320
<font color="#00ffff">And there is something about this</font>
<font color="#00ffff">portrait, isn't there, that speaks</font>

760
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,440
<font color="#00ffff">to that freshness and youth.</font>

761
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:11,360
<font color="#ffff00">Nice to know that she was also</font>
<font color="#ffff00">that beautiful in life. </font><font color="#00ffff">Yes.</font>

762
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:16,120
<font color="#ffff00">Once you can kind of feel</font>
<font color="#ffff00">like you've cracked a case,</font>

763
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,560
<font color="#ffff00">that is very satisfying.</font>

764
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,960
<font color="#ffffff">As the miniature masterpiece</font>
<font color="#ffffff">returns to the gallery...</font>

765
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:26,920
<font color="#ffffff">..visitors will be able to discover</font>
<font color="#ffffff">the true story of Lady Carteret</font>

766
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:28,560
<font color="#ffffff">for the first time.</font>

767
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,400
<font color="#ffff00">Portrait miniatures</font>
<font color="#ffff00">are such personal objects,</font>

768
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:34,040
<font color="#ffff00">and so often they become</font>
<font color="#ffff00">separated from their names.</font>

769
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:38,600
<font color="#ffff00">And so it's so exciting to be able</font>
<font color="#ffff00">to reunite the name with the face.</font>

770
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,800
<font color="#ffff00">So she's not an</font>
<font color="#ffff00">anonymous figure any more,</font>

771
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,760
<font color="#ffff00">but she is this individual woman</font>

772
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:47,560
<font color="#ffff00">and it reconnects her with her life,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">with her family, with her history.</font>

773
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:10,520
<font color="#ffffff">In the V&A's textile workshop,</font>

774
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,840
<font color="#ffffff">Lara is trying to breathe life</font>
<font color="#ffffff">back into</font>

775
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:15,640
<font color="#ffffff">the second Dior dress</font>
<font color="#ffffff">about to go on show.</font>

776
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:21,120
<font color="#00ff00">I'm afraid to say</font>
<font color="#00ff00">I've never worn a Dior.</font>

777
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,080
<font color="#00ff00">Kind of not in my budget, really.</font>

778
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:28,720
<font color="#00ff00">I think it's enough to kind of</font>
<font color="#00ff00">be able to handle them,</font>

779
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:31,600
<font color="#00ff00">and imagine yourself in them.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">I think that's pretty good.</font>

780
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:33,400
<font color="#00ff00">That's close enough.</font>

781
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,240
<font color="#ffffff">The black dress is haute couture...</font>

782
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:42,800
<font color="#ffffff">..made in Paris by the world's</font>
<font color="#ffffff">most skilled seamstresses,</font>

783
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,880
<font color="#ffffff">who could put 400 hours of work</font>
<font color="#ffffff">into a single dress.</font>

784
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:52,200
<font color="#ffffff">And it would have had</font>
<font color="#ffffff">a hefty price tag,</font>

785
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:57,120
<font color="#ffffff">with dresses costing anything</font>
<font color="#ffffff">up to £25,000 in today's money.</font>

786
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:02,280
<font color="#ffff00">So I'm looking at some pictures</font>

787
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:06,040
<font color="#ffff00">of the person who wore it,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">this dress.</font>

788
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:09,600
<font color="#ffff00">It's quite interesting to see...</font>

789
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,560
<font color="#ffff00">..what she looked like.</font>

790
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:18,760
<font color="#ffffff">Martita Hunt's career in films</font>
<font color="#ffffff">spanned the 1920s to the 1960s...</font>

791
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:23,000
<font color="#ffffff">..but she was best known</font>
<font color="#ffffff">for playing Miss Havisham</font>

792
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,600
<font color="#ffffff">in David Lean's Great Expectations.</font>

793
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:31,040
<font color="#ffff00">There is a sort of strange feeling</font>
<font color="#ffff00">as if you're recreating in some way</font>

794
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:33,720
<font color="#ffff00">the person that wore it.</font>

795
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:36,800
<font color="#ffff00">I think when you're working</font>
<font color="#ffff00">on the garment,</font>

796
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,600
<font color="#ffff00">there's a sort of slightly</font>
<font color="#ffff00">ghostly feel about it,</font>

797
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:42,040
<font color="#ffff00">that you're sort of bringing</font>
<font color="#ffff00">it back to life,</font>

798
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:46,200
<font color="#ffff00">and you are, you know, putting</font>
<font color="#ffff00">the person back into it.</font>

799
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:52,960
<font color="#ffffff">Now Lara must recreate</font>
<font color="#ffffff">Martita's exact body shape,</font>

800
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,640
<font color="#ffffff">using only the bespoke dress</font>
<font color="#ffffff">to guide her.</font>

801
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:59,560
<font color="#ffff00">The information of what that dress</font>
<font color="#ffff00">should look like is actually</font>

802
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:01,720
<font color="#ffff00">in the dress itself,</font>

803
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:06,440
<font color="#ffff00">and it becomes very much about</font>
<font color="#ffff00">where you put that padding.</font>

804
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:10,800
<font color="#ffffff">She begins by padding out</font>
<font color="#ffffff">a size-zero mannequin.</font>

805
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:14,880
<font color="#ffff00">I'm lowering the level of the waist</font>

806
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:20,000
<font color="#ffff00">because the dress is a lot</font>
<font color="#ffff00">longer body than this figure is,</font>

807
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,360
<font color="#ffff00">so the waist is</font>
<font color="#ffff00">naturally about here,</font>

808
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:24,360
<font color="#ffff00">and I've dropped down to here</font>

809
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:26,320
<font color="#ffff00">by the way I've laid on</font>
<font color="#ffff00">the bits of padding.</font>

810
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:29,920
<font color="#ffffff">To recreate Martita's</font>
<font color="#ffffff">hourglass hips,</font>

811
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:32,800
<font color="#ffffff">she's using sections</font>
<font color="#ffffff">of polyester wadding,</font>

812
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,560
<font color="#ffffff">which are pulled apart</font>
<font color="#ffffff">to make a feathered edge.</font>

813
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:41,520
<font color="#ffffff">A herringbone stitch secures</font>
<font color="#ffffff">each section in place.</font>

814
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:45,160
<font color="#ffff00">Herringbone is great because it</font>
<font color="#ffff00">helps you keep the edges flat.</font>

815
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:47,520
<font color="#ffff00">What you don't want</font>
<font color="#ffff00">is the edges to fluff up.</font>

816
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:51,040
<font color="#ffff00">You want them to lie as flat</font>
<font color="#ffff00">to the body as possible</font>

817
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:54,520
<font color="#ffff00">so that the padding and the body</font>
<font color="#ffff00">kind of become one.</font>

818
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:01,520
<font color="#ffffff">Finally, after 40 hours</font>
<font color="#ffffff">of meticulous sculpting,</font>

819
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:04,880
<font color="#ffffff">it's only now that Lara and Lilia</font>
<font color="#ffffff">will find out if the body shapes</font>

820
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,560
<font color="#ffffff">they have made are right.</font>

821
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:11,400
<font color="#ffff00">It will be the moment of truth</font>
<font color="#ffff00">when we try the dress on.</font>

822
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:14,120
<font color="#ffff00">Great. You hold it there. </font><font color="#00ffff">Yes.</font>

823
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:16,600
<font color="#ffff00">It's got these</font>
<font color="#ffff00">very clear pleats in it,</font>

824
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:19,120
<font color="#ffff00">with a strong diagonal</font>
<font color="#ffff00">straight line.</font>

825
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:22,600
<font color="#ffff00">Just gently...ease it up.</font>

826
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:26,360
<font color="#ffff00">If the padding is too much</font>
<font color="#ffff00">in one area or the other,</font>

827
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:28,720
<font color="#ffff00">it's going to pull</font>
<font color="#ffff00">those pleats out of shape,</font>

828
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,720
<font color="#ffff00">so it's really important</font>
<font color="#ffff00">that it fits like a glove.</font>

829
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,240
<font color="#ffff00">Does that look centred?</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Tack this here.</font>

830
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:40,000
<font color="#ffff00">That's quite a good fit.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Excellent.</font>

831
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,000
<font color="#ffff00">I think it's looking</font>
<font color="#ffff00">a lot better than it was.</font>

832
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:48,520
<font color="#ffff00">One of the problems it had before</font>
<font color="#ffff00">was the whole thing was dropping</font>

833
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:51,400
<font color="#ffff00">because there was nothing</font>
<font color="#ffff00">on the hips to keep it up,</font>

834
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:52,920
<font color="#ffff00">and the waist wasn't supported.</font>

835
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:57,080
<font color="#ffff00">And so now it is lifted, so it</font>
<font color="#ffff00">doesn't have that dragging effect.</font>

836
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:01,360
<font color="#ffff00">And the hips are a really good fit.</font>

837
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:04,680
<font color="#ffff00">They're showing it off</font>
<font color="#ffff00">really quite beautifully.</font>

838
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:18,360
<font color="#ffffff">Now both dresses can take their</font>
<font color="#ffffff">place in the Dior exhibition.</font>

839
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:21,720
<font color="#ffff00">There's always a lovely moment</font>
<font color="#ffff00">at the end when it's done</font>

840
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:25,040
<font color="#ffff00">and you stand back</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and you have a good look.</font>

841
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:27,040
<font color="#ffff00">Hopefully it looks lovely.</font>

842
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:31,920
<font color="#ffff00">That is when it's</font>
<font color="#ffff00">a really satisfying job.</font>

843
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:36,600
<font color="#ffffff">Pamela Mann, the original owner</font>
<font color="#ffffff">of the pink dress,</font>

844
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:39,800
<font color="#ffffff">will be coming to see the results</font>
<font color="#ffffff">for herself in a week's time.</font>

845
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:48,360
<font color="#ffffff">In the conservation department,</font>
<font color="#ffffff">Will's bringing Emma -</font>

846
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:51,920
<font color="#ffffff">a relative of the Cattley children -</font>
<font color="#ffffff">to meet the newly restored Pumpie.</font>

847
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:55,640
<font color="#ffff00">Hello. </font><font color="#00ff00">Hello. Thank you.</font>

848
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:58,920
<font color="#00ffff">From working with Pumpie</font>
<font color="#00ffff">over the last few months,</font>

849
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:01,280
<font color="#00ffff">we've found out an awful lot</font>
<font color="#00ffff">of things about him.</font>

850
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:04,440
<font color="#00ffff">We now know what his original colour</font>
<font color="#00ffff">was. We know he has a tail -</font>

851
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:05,880
<font color="#00ffff">I never suspected that at all.</font>

852
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:08,800
<font color="#00ffff">We can understand so much</font>
<font color="#00ffff">more about how he was made.</font>

853
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,480
<font color="#ffff00">Ready? </font><font color="#00ffff">I'm ready, yes.</font>

854
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:15,520
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, look at him! </font><font color="#00ff00">He's so sweet.</font>

855
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:18,240
<font color="#00ffff">He looks so much better.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Doesn't he? </font><font color="#00ffff">Yeah, he does.</font>

856
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,600
<font color="#00ffff">You can't see through his nose</font>
<font color="#00ffff">any more!</font>

857
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,480
<font color="#ffff00">Yes, you can't see the stuffing.</font>

858
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,360
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah, that's really good.</font>

859
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,000
<font color="#00ff00">When you see him like that,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">his trunk's actually wonky. </font><font color="#ffff00">Yes.</font>

860
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,880
<font color="#ffff00">It's been like that</font>
<font color="#ffff00">for a very long time.</font>

861
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,320
<font color="#ffff00">When you look at the pictures,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">you can see it. </font><font color="#00ff00">Can I touch him?</font>

862
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:34,720
<font color="#ffff00">Yes, you can.</font>

863
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,640
<font color="#ffffff">Emma never had the chance</font>
<font color="#ffffff">to meet Pumpie</font>

864
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,920
<font color="#ffffff">while he was a member of the family.</font>

865
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:40,600
<font color="#00ff00">It's amazing, isn't it?</font>

866
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:44,040
<font color="#00ff00">And to think it's lasted this</font>
<font color="#00ff00">long, as well. </font><font color="#ffff00">Yeah. </font><font color="#00ffff">Yeah.</font>

867
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:46,080
<font color="#00ffff">They looked after him. </font><font color="#00ff00">Yes.</font>

868
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:48,800
<font color="#00ff00">It's quite touching, actually,</font>

869
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:52,080
<font color="#00ff00">to think somebody who's part of</font>
<font color="#00ff00">my family actually made this</font>

870
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:54,480
<font color="#00ff00">over 100 years ago,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">and it's sitting here</font>

871
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:57,800
<font color="#00ff00">and someone's taken the time and</font>
<font color="#00ff00">effort to restore it, it's lovely.</font>

872
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:02,520
<font color="#ffffff">Jo's new felt</font>
<font color="#ffffff">and painstaking repairs</font>

873
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:05,400
<font color="#ffffff">have seamlessly restored</font>
<font color="#ffffff">Pumpie's trunk,</font>

874
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,240
<font color="#ffffff">rolling back the years.</font>

875
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:09,640
<font color="#00ffff">You've done a brilliant</font>
<font color="#00ffff">job with him, Jo.</font>

876
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:12,160
<font color="#00ffff">It all looks so much more stable.</font>

877
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,400
<font color="#00ffff">He just looks so much</font>
<font color="#00ffff">cleaner and healthier.</font>

878
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,240
<font color="#00ffff">It's like it's taken...</font>
<font color="#00ffff">ten years off him!</font>

879
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:20,280
<font color="#00ff00">Years younger. </font><font color="#00ffff">Yeah, exactly.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Proper face-lift, I think.</font>

880
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:24,480
<font color="#00ffff">But also whilst preserving</font>
<font color="#00ffff">the fact that he is an old,</font>

881
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,640
<font color="#00ffff">much-loved soft toy.</font>

882
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,920
<font color="#00ff00">Are they genuine buttons,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">sort of...? </font><font color="#ffff00">Yeah!</font>

883
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:33,880
<font color="#ffff00">I think they're</font>
<font color="#ffff00">uniform buttons, or...</font>

884
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:36,200
<font color="#ffff00">A lot of children also had</font>
<font color="#ffff00">military-style clothing,</font>

885
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:37,520
<font color="#ffff00">it was very popular.</font>

886
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:40,200
<font color="#00ffff">Well, he's a sailor, so he's got</font>
<font color="#00ffff">to have his brass buttons. </font><font color="#ffff00">Yeah.</font>

887
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:43,360
<font color="#ffffff">Will has brought along some photos</font>
<font color="#ffffff">of the Cattley children</font>

888
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:45,200
<font color="#ffffff">from the V&A's archive.</font>

889
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:49,120
<font color="#00ff00">This is Gilbert.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">That's Gilbert, yes.</font>

890
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:51,880
<font color="#00ff00">So he was the youngest son. He was</font>
<font color="#00ff00">the one who did all the painting.</font>

891
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:53,040
<font color="#ffff00">Mm-hm.</font>

892
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,680
<font color="#00ffff">I think that was Maude.</font>

893
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:57,680
<font color="#00ff00">That's quite military.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Yes, it is. </font><font color="#00ff00">A little Navy suit.</font>

894
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:00,120
<font color="#00ff00">And look at the buttons. </font><font color="#ffff00">Yeah. </font><font color="#00ffff">Yeah.</font>

895
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:03,520
<font color="#ffff00">Very similar - that's maybe</font>
<font color="#ffff00">where they came from.</font>

896
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:07,160
<font color="#ffff00">It might be his buttons,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">or they had more of them</font>

897
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:10,000
<font color="#ffff00">the same - that would be logical,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">wouldn't it? </font><font color="#00ff00">Mm. </font><font color="#00ffff">Yeah.</font>

898
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,280
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah, maybe once he</font>
<font color="#00ffff">grew out of that coat,</font>

899
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:15,440
<font color="#00ffff">they might have recycled some of</font>
<font color="#00ffff">the buttons from it.</font>

900
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:19,480
<font color="#00ff00">It's lovely. Brings people to life</font>
<font color="#00ff00">and, sort of...</font>

901
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:20,600
<font color="#00ff00">People that I've met -</font>

902
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:23,920
<font color="#00ff00">because I know I did meet Maude</font>
<font color="#00ff00">as an old lady -</font>

903
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:26,320
<font color="#00ff00">but seeing her as a child is lovely.</font>

904
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:30,240
<font color="#ffffff">A closer inspection of the photos</font>
<font color="#ffffff">shows just how treasured</font>

905
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,040
<font color="#ffffff">these toys were.</font>

906
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:36,320
<font color="#ffff00">Seeing them in their outfits in a</font>
<font color="#ffff00">line, and then looking at the dolls,</font>

907
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:39,080
<font color="#ffff00">it's like they were making</font>
<font color="#ffff00">miniature versions of themselves.</font>

908
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:40,720
<font color="#00ffff">It does seem that way, doesn't it?</font>

909
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:43,280
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, they've got</font>
<font color="#ffff00">the matching clothing.</font>

910
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:45,600
<font color="#00ff00">To actually see pictures</font>
<font color="#00ff00">of them as youngsters -</font>

911
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:47,840
<font color="#00ff00">I've not seen these pictures</font>
<font color="#00ff00">before - it's brilliant.</font>

912
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:52,080
<font color="#00ff00">Seeing Pumpie in the flesh,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">it was a lovely experience.</font>

913
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:55,280
<font color="#00ff00">And I got to share</font>
<font color="#00ff00">the story of my ancestors,</font>

914
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:59,080
<font color="#00ff00">and I've come away with a sense that</font>
<font color="#00ff00">they were very talented children.</font>

915
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:01,920
<font color="#00ff00">I like to think that some of</font>
<font color="#00ff00">that has trickled down</font>

916
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:04,480
<font color="#00ff00">into some of the people</font>
<font color="#00ff00">who are alive today.</font>

917
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:07,160
<font color="#00ffff">Pumpie has as much relevance</font>
<font color="#00ffff">in a museum as some of the more</font>

918
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:11,320
<font color="#00ffff">obviously precious things, because</font>
<font color="#00ffff">he, in many ways, is just as rare.</font>

919
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:14,680
<font color="#00ffff">He's quite an inspiring story</font>
<font color="#00ffff">of the creativity of children,</font>

920
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:17,400
<font color="#00ffff">and he is an interesting</font>
<font color="#00ffff">insight into</font>

921
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:19,920
<font color="#00ffff">what children were interested in</font>

922
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:22,360
<font color="#00ffff">in the late 19th,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">early 20th century.</font>

923
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:25,960
<font color="#00ffff">That's one of the reasons why it's</font>
<font color="#00ffff">important that we preserve him.</font>

924
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:30,920
<font color="#ffffff">Now Pumpie is packing his trunk</font>
<font color="#ffffff">and heading off to star</font>

925
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:33,040
<font color="#ffffff">in a special exhibition,</font>

926
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:36,320
<font color="#ffffff">where he'll meet a new</font>
<font color="#ffffff">generation of children.</font>

927
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:47,920
<font color="#00ff00">OK, folks, ready for Dior?</font>

928
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:50,600
<font color="#00ff00">Come on down, folks.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Come on down for Dior.</font>

929
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:53,280
<font color="#00ff00">First few only, though -</font>
<font color="#00ff00">first few only.</font>

930
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:58,040
<font color="#ffffff">It's 9am, and the crowds are</font>
<font color="#ffffff">already lining up for Dior.</font>

931
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:00,960
<font color="#ffff00">He designed for women,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">didn't he? </font><font color="#00ffff">Yes.</font>

932
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:03,760
<font color="#ffff00">So you could you could have</font>
<font color="#ffff00">the hourglass... </font><font color="#00ffff">Exactly, yes.</font>

933
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:06,360
<font color="#ffff00">But I would love to have something</font>
<font color="#ffff00">with that jewellery on.</font>

934
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:09,720
<font color="#00ff00">This is my fantastic favourite.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">I love this one.</font>

935
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:11,520
<font color="#00ff00">I think I could look good in it!</font>

936
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:14,440
<font color="#00ff00">Yeah, I don't know where</font>
<font color="#00ff00">I'd wear it, but... Yeah.</font>

937
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:17,800
<font color="#00ff00">I could wear that with my nice</font>
<font color="#00ff00">pearls and things. It's lovely.</font>

938
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:23,440
<font color="#ffffff">But among the Dior devotees</font>
<font color="#ffffff">is one particular VIP.</font>

939
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:27,840
<font color="#00ffff">Well, I'm looking forward to this.</font>

940
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:33,680
<font color="#ffffff">Pamela Mann has arrived to see a</font>
<font color="#ffffff">little part of her past go on show.</font>

941
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,800
<font color="#ffff00">It's magic, isn't it?</font>

942
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,040
<font color="#ffffff">And she's brought her daughter</font>
<font color="#ffffff">and granddaughter with her.</font>

943
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:44,160
<font color="#00ffff">I think I can spot it.</font>

944
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:45,880
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, here! Here!</font>

945
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:47,960
<font color="#00ff00">This one? </font><font color="#ffff00">Yes!</font>

946
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:51,440
<font color="#00ffff">Is it this one in the case? </font><font color="#ffff00">Yes,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">it's this one. </font><font color="#00ffff">Oh, look at that!</font>

947
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:53,600
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, how beautiful! </font><font color="#ffff00">Yes!</font>

948
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,960
<font color="#ffff00">I'd forgotten the bones.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">It's amazing!</font>

949
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:57,560
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, isn't that beautiful?</font>

950
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:59,160
<font color="#ffff00">It's exquisite, isn't it?</font>

951
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:02,320
<font color="#ffff00">Ooh, wasn't I a tiny little thing?</font>

952
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:06,120
<font color="#00ffff">Presumably that is your exact</font>
<font color="#00ffff">figure. </font><font color="#ffff00">Yes, that was my...</font>

953
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:10,400
<font color="#ffff00">I think... I think so,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">because it fitted perfectly.</font>

954
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:14,960
<font color="#ffff00">I didn't have to have any</font>
<font color="#ffff00">alterations really at all. </font><font color="#00ffff">No.</font>

955
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:18,040
<font color="#ffff00">Every time I wore it... </font><font color="#00ff00">Everybody's</font>
<font color="#00ff00">eyes upon you, I'm sure.</font>

956
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:19,720
<font color="#ffff00">..I felt a million dollars. </font><font color="#00ff00">Yeah.</font>

957
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:21,480
<font color="#ffff00">I felt good.</font>

958
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:23,880
<font color="#ffff00">And I don't mind saying,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">I felt good.</font>

959
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:33,320
<font color="#ffff00">I think how lucky I am that I had</font>
<font color="#ffff00">a husband who was romantic enough</font>

960
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:38,040
<font color="#ffff00">to sort of buy it for me and sort of</font>
<font color="#ffff00">see that I looked absolutely,</font>

961
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:40,080
<font color="#ffff00">you know, the best I could.</font>

962
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:42,360
<font color="#00ffff">And now you're sharing it. </font><font color="#ffff00">Yes, yes.</font>

963
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:46,120
<font color="#ffff00">It's sort of a little thank you</font>
<font color="#ffff00">to him, if you like. </font><font color="#00ffff">Yeah.</font>

964
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:51,440
<font color="#ffff00">To me, it was rather a</font>
<font color="#ffff00">sort of very loving thing to do.</font>

965
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:52,680
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah. </font><font color="#ffff00">I think.</font>

966
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:56,920
<font color="#ffff00">You've given me such pleasure,</font>

967
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:59,760
<font color="#ffff00">and that's...</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Really, I want you to know that</font>

968
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:03,440
<font color="#ffff00">because I think that is...</font>
<font color="#ffff00">It was a very happy thing for me.</font>

969
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:06,600
<font color="#ffff00">And I think you've really</font>
<font color="#ffff00">excelled yourself.</font>

970
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:10,080
<font color="#00ffff">It's lovely to be able to hear</font>
<font color="#00ffff">the story behind the dress.</font>

971
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:12,840
<font color="#00ffff">It's kind of like</font>
<font color="#00ffff">a vindication of what we do,</font>

972
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:15,000
<font color="#00ffff">that we've done it correctly.</font>

973
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,360
<font color="#00ffff">And that it kind of had so much</font>
<font color="#00ffff">meaning for her, as well,</font>

974
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:20,800
<font color="#00ffff">to see her garment on display.</font>

975
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:23,400
<font color="#00ff00">It's a magic moment because</font>
<font color="#00ff00">you've put all this effort</font>

976
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:26,520
<font color="#00ff00">and spent a lot of time</font>
<font color="#00ff00">trying to get it right.</font>

977
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:28,520
<font color="#00ff00">And now it's finished.</font>

978
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:32,680
<font color="#00ff00">And if you know something about</font>
<font color="#00ff00">the person who wore it,</font>

979
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:37,000
<font color="#00ff00">it kind of adds in a little</font>
<font color="#00ff00">layer of connection, I think.</font>

980
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:41,040
<font color="#00ff00">Yeah, it's a good moment.</font>

981
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:49,400
<font color="#ffffff">Next time,</font>

982
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:53,120
<font color="#ffffff">a diamond ring owned</font>
<font color="#ffffff">by Beyonce takes flight.</font>

983
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:56,240
<font color="#00ffff">It's almost irresistible</font>
<font color="#00ffff">not to place it on your finger,</font>

984
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:57,680
<font color="#00ffff">but we don't do that.</font>

985
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:01,720
<font color="#ffffff">A Renaissance statue is</font>
<font color="#ffffff">suffering from a skin disease.</font>

986
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:04,520
<font color="#ffff00">It's like mumps or chickenpox,</font>

987
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:07,640
<font color="#ffff00">and it can spread to other bronzes.</font>

988
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:10,680
<font color="#ffffff">And a new acquisition brings</font>
<font color="#ffffff">a forgotten story to light.</font>

989
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:14,240
<font color="#00ffff">I want to be able to tell</font>
<font color="#00ffff">these stories to my kids.</font>

990
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,040
<font color="#00ffff">It's fantastic history.</font>

991
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:21,120
<font color="#ffffff">What does it take</font>
<font color="#ffffff">to be a museum curator?</font>

992
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:24,920
<font color="#ffffff">Watch an extended behind-the-scenes</font>
<font color="#ffffff">look with the V&A's curators</font>

993
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:28,240
<font color="#ffffff">and have a go at curating</font>
<font color="#ffffff">the museum's collection yourself.</font>

994
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:30,840
<font color="#ffffff">Go to...</font>
