one that possibly wards off the plague.

a man of faith received a message from God

compelling him to believe that smallpox was caused

even months after their burials.

They removed the hearts,

Poor Edward.

Edward?

There is something terribly wrong with that boy.

I've tried.

I've tried everything I can to get him on the right path.

700
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:33,900

I even married a woman who mothered him as her own son,

but deep down,

702
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:37,740

he never loved her.

703
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:39,880

He's never loved a single soul.

704
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:48,100
��Ϊ����������̳���
Because he inherited this wickedness

from you.

of nothing but love.

Your love is a curse that must be stopped.

You must tell everyone

Your father is dead.

Do you see that cow outside?
