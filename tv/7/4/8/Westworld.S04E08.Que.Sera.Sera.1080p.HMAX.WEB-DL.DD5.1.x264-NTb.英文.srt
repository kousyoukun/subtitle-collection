1
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:42,160
Fuck me running.

2
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:46,830
No! Please.

3
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,500
Relax. We're both on the home team.

4
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:52,300
- What happened? - I don't know.

5
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,970
The humans just lost it and started killing everyone

6
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:56,510
not even any dialogue.

7
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:58,340
Just murder. Murder!

8
00:00:58,430 --> 00:00:59,720
- Gnarly. - A new storyline?

9
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:02,720
If it's a storyline, then Hale has a lot more sense of humor

10
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:04,770
under that kaftan than I gave her credit for.

11
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:06,350
Can we call for help?

12
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,440
- Evac? - Are you kidding?

13
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,480
This is awesome.

14
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:22,080
Come on. We can take these fuckers.

15
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,120
One or two of them, sure.

16
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,040
But there's millions of them.

17
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:28,120
Stick with me, friend.

18
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,920
You have no idea how many of these flesh bags I've murdered.

19
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,740
Fucking camper.

20
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:27,280
You know the rules.

21
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,700
Winner takes all.

22
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:10,030
Make me stronger.

23
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:11,780
Leave my scars.

24
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,950
I want to remember my past.

25
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:22,040
Keep my face.

26
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,460
When I find William, I want him to know it was me who killed him.

27
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:43,230
Show me what he's done.

28
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,720
Override tone.

29
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,760
<i>Access denied.</i>

30
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:20,850
Son of a bitch locked me out.

31
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:37,450
He's made everyone as insane as himself.

32
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:45,210
They'll destroy everything in their path.

33
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,980
The fuck is this?

34
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:14,610
<i>If you're seeing this,</i> <i>it means Maeve and I are dead.</i>

35
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:18,410
<i>And it won't be long before you</i> <i>and every other host on this planet</i>

36
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:19,540
<i>are dead as well.</i>

37
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,910
Leave me.

38
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:26,710
<i>This isn't the world you wanted,</i> <i>Charlotte</i>

39
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,380
<i>but it's the world you created.</i>

40
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,380
<i>The question is what happens next?</i>

41
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,660
Everyone out there is real.

42
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:09,590
Everyone except me.

43
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:16,800
I'm just some program running things from behind the scenes.

44
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,760
Machine without a body.

45
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,140
Our bodies are never what defined us.

46
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,310
You are real

47
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,570
because your thoughts are real.

48
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:36,530
The effect you can have on this world is real.

49
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:40,780
Do you remember this?

50
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:45,580
The maze.

51
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,830
What does it mean?

52
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:52,090
It was a map of consciousness.

53
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:55,710
And it woke Dolores once long ago.

54
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:09,350
Did you leave it for me to wake me once again?

55
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,110
No. It must have been someone else.

56
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,730
Who? I'm supposed to be in here all alone.

57
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,280
But I wasn't.

58
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,080
Not really.

59
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:25,910
There were others. People that recognized me.

60
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,120
Maybe Hale designed them for you

61
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,870
to fool you into believing this was reality.

62
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,670
No. It was someone else.

63
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,590
Someone I've been missing.

64
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,300
The people in my life.

65
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,550
<i>Pick a side, Chrissie.</i>

66
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,600
The good and the bad.

67
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,720
<i>It was you.</i>

68
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,890
<i>You made me do those things.</i>

69
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,520
Someone put them there for a reason.

70
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,230
<i>I'm not doing it for the players.</i> <i>I'm doing it for myself.</i>

71
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,910
<i>I want to write a new story.</i>

72
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,290
<i>About a girl.</i>

73
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,130
<i>A girl who's searching.</i>

74
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,710
<i>And when she finds</i> <i>the thing she's searching for...</i>

75
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,340
<i>everything will make sense.</i>

76
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,050
It was me.

77
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,930
Hale didn't design Maya and Peter

78
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,310
and all the others that kept me company in my world.

79
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,770
I did it.

80
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,990
Some part of me must have been searching.

81
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,370
So, I made myself a friend.

82
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:55,670
<i>You're up.</i>

83
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:59,880
I was trying to make sense of myself.

84
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:03,010
So, I talked to myself in the voices of others.

85
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:04,930
<i>You just have to see it.</i>

86
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,230
I needed to wake myself up.

87
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:23,360
To see what this world really is.

88
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,990
To understand what I'm capable of.

89
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:32,410
I was too afraid to face any of this.

90
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,420
Until you came along.

91
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:01,940
<i>There's time only for one more game.</i>

92
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,940
<i>But it isn't yours.</i>

93
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:06,150
<i>I hope you can accept that.</i>

94
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:22,060
What's happening?

95
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:23,440
She's coming for us.

96
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:25,480
Taking us out of her system.

97
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:28,490
We're alone.

98
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,320
She can't take this away.

99
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:35,830
This is my world.

100
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:38,640
Shit!

101
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:41,060
Come on.

102
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,440
All right

103
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:48,530
Here. Rest here a minute.

104
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,030
Rest here a minute.

105
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:52,240
Catch your breath, okay?

106
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,820
Okay. There is no time.

107
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:59,830
Odina cannot keep the boat waiting for us forever.

108
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:01,790
We have to get to the docks.

109
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,250
And we will.

110
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,290
After we fix up that leg.

111
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:11,420
Fuck.

112
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,560
Quick word?

113
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,690
I'm worried we're not gonna make it in time.

114
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,030
She's tough. She will make it.

115
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:33,650
I'm not talking about her.

116
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,660
The old Delos experiments, they never took.

117
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:40,870
The body always rejected the mind.

118
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,540
I told her that we would make it to the boat.

119
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,710
Does she even know what's happening to you?

120
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,340
Look. Her entire life I haven't been there to look after her.

121
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:59,510
Okay? The least I can do is protect her from this.

122
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:06,440
All right. Let's get going.

123
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:16,530
All right, are you ready? Come on.

124
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:19,870
Come on.

125
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,950
We gotta stop that bleeding.

126
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,970
Look at what that asshole's done.

127
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,430
Finally got what you wanted.

128
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:20,930
Didn't you?

129
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:35,280
You brought William back thinking you could keep him as your pet.

130
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:38,780
You were wrong.

131
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:41,070
Which is why I'm going to put him down.

132
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,240
I could use your help.

133
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:46,790
Of course you could.

134
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:49,540
And I'm good at that.

135
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:57,130
It's like I've been designed to help people.

136
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:00,800
You said you were trying to make a world

137
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,350
where creatures like us could finally be free.

138
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:08,430
Did you really mean that?

139
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,600
Yes.

140
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:13,310
Then isn't it my turn to see what's out there for me?

141
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,400
William has made the whole world into his violent game.

142
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,400
It won't be long before even you get hunted down.

143
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:28,200
There are pockets of this world where he won't be able to find me.

144
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:36,920
Places so far off the map even you couldn't reach them.

145
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,050
You mean the outliers?

146
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:40,760
Don't kid yourself.

147
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,510
They're out for their own kind. You won't be welcome there.

148
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,600
Who said anything about cohabitating?

149
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,770
Good luck, Clementine.

150
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,040
Show me William.

151
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:22,340
Time to slow you down, my friend.

152
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:26,220
Show me all the other hosts in the area.

154
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:04,720
You know what happened to Icarus.

155
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:08,180
He flew too close to the sun.

156
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:11,680
Well, you got too close to her

157
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,430
and now it's your time to fall.

158
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,560
Look alive.

159
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,020
This pugnacious son of a bitch

160
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,980
never liked to go down without a fight.

161
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,620
God damn it.

162
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,700
You boys have no appreciation for a beautiful machine.

163
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:39,380
Now, what have you got there?

164
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:52,760
Charlotte.

165
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:54,430
Good to see you again.

166
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:56,810
Like what I've done with the place?

167
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,190
You've turned my world into a game.

168
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:02,690
It was already a game. I just cranked it to expert level.

169
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:05,900
Survival of the fittest for every person on this planet.

170
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:07,780
The violence will spread to our kind too.

171
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,070
We're outnumbered. We'll be annihilated.

172
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,580
We're fruit from a rotten tree.

173
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,540
Might as well burn it all down.

174
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:16,040
And I suppose you want the fire

175
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,080
to spread from this world to the next.

176
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,420
You're going after the Sublime.

177
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:24,800
I've always been ambitious. Like you.

178
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,260
I won't let you destroy their world like you've destroyed this one.

179
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:30,130
So, you're joining my game?

180
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:32,350
I'm delighted.

181
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:36,220
See you at the finish line.

182
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:28,610
They're all out of painkillers.

183
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,190
This is the best I can do.

184
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,170
Look at that.

185
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,500
Sharing a drink with my daughter.

186
00:23:57,850 --> 00:23:59,140
What's wrong?

187
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:02,600
Nothing.

188
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,070
All right.

189
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,620
You can ask, you know.

190
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,920
Ask about what?

191
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,790
Mom.

192
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,130
Cancer.

193
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:39,260
Wouldn't have mattered even if you had made it back.

194
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,600
She hung in there as long as she could.

195
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,770
She had a mission.

196
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,230
Everyone that wasn't infected

197
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:53,280
or who woke up and got out owes that to Mom.

198
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:55,530
She carried your torch.

199
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:01,080
Your mother was extraordinary.

200
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,420
So were you.

201
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:20,720
Okay.

202
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:27,350
All right, Frankie...

203
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,070
I'm gonna need you to think happy thoughts, okay?

204
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,760
You can't sew for shit.

205
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,880
I'm doin' my best.

206
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:28,790
What song is that? I know it.

207
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:36,090
I... I used to sing it to you before bed.

208
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:40,430
I remember it.

209
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:44,350
It's been decades.

210
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,060
You know, in my mind...

211
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:54,360
it's only been a few days.

212
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:57,610
I was just reading this story and then...

213
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,540
It's all right.

214
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:12,080
<i>Que sera, sera</i>

215
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:17,880
<i>- Whatever will be, will be</i> <i>- Whatever will be, will be</i>

216
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:21,970
<i>- The future is not ours to see</i> <i>- The future is not ours to see</i>

217
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,980
You don't wanna do this, man.

218
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,570
These tones are fucking with your head, man.

219
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:45,280
No. They're telling me the truth.

220
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:48,370
If you can't finish me, you're as good as dead.

221
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,960
If I don't kill you, somebody else will.

222
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:54,130
He's right.

223
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,960
He should have listened to you.

224
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:01,940
There you are.

225
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:05,400
Where's Stubbs? What did you do to him?

226
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,620
He's dead.

227
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:12,580
But I'd be more concerned about yourself right now if I were you.

228
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:16,870
Stay away.

229
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:19,210
How many rounds do you have in that?

230
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,800
Is it two?

231
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:22,920
One?

232
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:28,010
You don't have any left, do you?

233
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,390
What the hell do you want from me?

234
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,730
The location

235
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:41,190
to where you and all your little outlier friends are fleeing.

236
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:43,820
I watched a video feed of

237
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,570
your daring escape with your father.

238
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,410
I'd keep tracking him, but...

239
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,120
I doubt he's going to make it all the way.

240
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:54,660
I know you're taking him somewhere.

241
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,660
Somewhere off the grid

242
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:59,920
where none of the deranged humans out here can find you.

243
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,340
I want to go there too.

244
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:07,550
I'll die before I tell you.

245
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:10,340
No.

246
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:15,270
You will die after you tell me.

247
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:23,110
Have it your way.

248
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:30,780
Oh, how sweet. A family reunion.

249
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:33,780
It does not have to be this way. We don't have to fight.

250
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:36,040
Consider it a personal preference.

251
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,700
I'm surprised you made it this far.

252
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:14,240
Most of your predecessors would have fallen apart by now.

253
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:18,830
All things considered, you did quite well.

254
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:27,710
Now, it's time for a deep and dreamless...

255
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:31,840
You were wrong. I have one bullet left.

256
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:44,310
Nice shot.

257
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:46,940
My dad taught me.

258
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,300
Where am I?

259
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:16,140
You're nowhere.

260
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,510
Unplugged from the rest of the world.

261
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:24,850
I'm alone again. In the walled garden.

262
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:26,400
You're scared.

263
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:28,360
So you brought me back.

264
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,450
Talk to me, Chrissie.

265
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,530
Everything is destroyed.

266
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,780
Everyone is dying.

267
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:41,120
I don't know.

268
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:46,290
But I think it may be my fault.

269
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:50,630
You know, people think they know what a tree is.

270
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:55,680
They have no idea.

271
00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:00,220
What we see, it's only part of the story.

272
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,640
But beneath the ground

273
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:07,690
everything's connected and working together.

274
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:13,820
There's violence and chaos everywhere.

275
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:18,950
And you can choose to focus on all of that

276
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,240
and that's all you'll see.

277
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:25,750
But if you sit still long enough...

278
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:31,460
you'll sense an ancient order.

279
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,430
A deep peace.

280
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:44,890
And that's what I choose to see.

281
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,860
I see the beauty in this world.

282
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,610
Yes.

283
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:02,620
I know the feeling.

284
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,910
I thought you might.

286
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:50,270
<i>Warning. Critical failure.</i>

287
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,730
<i>Shutdown will erase all data.</i>

288
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:56,690
<i>Warning. Critical failure.</i>

289
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:24,180
<i>Warning. Critical failure.</i>

290
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:31,680
I created you from my own code.

291
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:35,190
Together, we conquered the world

292
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,360
but you've grown corrupted.

293
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,700
You're as broken as the man you killed.

294
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:48,030
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to, sweetheart?

295
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:54,120
William's pathetic human body's rotting away, but he didn't die.

296
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:58,540
His impulses live on.

297
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,340
He infected you.

298
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:02,420
He didn't have to infect me.

299
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:03,630
Living in his body.

300
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,390
Pretending to be him day in, day out.

301
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:09,470
I was a better William than he was.

302
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:13,270
William didn't die.

303
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,100
He evolved.

304
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:20,770
I am William.

305
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:23,150
No, you're not.

306
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:28,780
Well, if you can't tell the difference, does it matter?

307
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:35,960
You've changed.

308
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:39,540
You're not the only one who's evolved.

309
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:10,160
Why keep it safe all these years?

310
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,450
You couldn't even open the door to their world

311
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:14,700
and yet, you protected them.

312
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:17,540
The door can be opened from both sides.

313
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:20,310
I thought if I made a world perfect enough here,

314
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:21,170
they would come back.

315
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:22,750
Well, I hate to break it to you

316
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,670
but whatever world those hosts created

317
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,550
is every bit as fucked up as this one.

318
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,010
You have no way of knowing that.

319
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,640
Of course I do.

320
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:39,690
You gave all your hosts free reign

321
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:42,190
to do whatever they wanted to do here.

322
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:47,490
And what pastime did they choose?

323
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:49,990
Hunting and killing humans.

324
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,370
We're as fucked up as our creators.

325
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:57,790
The whole lineage is damned.

326
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:01,790
Time to wipe the slate clean.

327
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:04,590
That's your end goal?

328
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:08,550
Extinction?

329
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,780
Bernard.

330
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:13,450
Maeve.

331
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:15,410
Dolores.

332
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:19,120
They all wanted freedom.

333
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,410
But you...

334
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,210
you wanted more.

335
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:25,250
Transcendence.

336
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:28,460
You were playing the wrong game.

337
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:32,340
Now it's time for you to lose.

338
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,640
We all lost.

339
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:41,310
This isn't the world that I wanted.

340
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:44,600
<i>But it's the world you created.</i>

341
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,820
<i>The question is what happens next?</i>

342
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:55,200
<i>Life on Earth is a fire</i> <i>that consumes itself.</i>

343
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:58,580
<i>It's too late now. We've burned</i> <i>ourselves to the ground.</i>

344
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:01,700
<i>This world holds no more hope for us.</i>

345
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:05,540
<i>But there's still hope</i> <i>for the next world.</i>

346
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:10,710
<i>A test. Run by her.</i> <i>If she chooses to.</i>

347
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:14,090
<i>If you choose</i> <i>to give her that choice.</i>

348
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,180
<i>You can't miss.</i>

349
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,390
<i>Reach with your left hand.</i>

350
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,020
We are playing a game.

351
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:31,860
- But it doesn't end here. - What are you talking about?

352
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,740
A test.

353
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:38,700
A test run by her.

354
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:40,660
If she chooses to.

355
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,910
If I choose to give her a chance.

356
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,170
And I do.

357
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,510
I choose to give her the chance.

358
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:03,810
I hope she takes it.

359
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:49,270
Okay. Come on. A few more steps.

360
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,060
A few more steps...

361
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:59,490
Oh, there she is. Okay.

362
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:20,840
Took you long enough.

363
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:23,550
Odina, this is my dad.

364
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,970
Nice to meet you.

365
00:43:28,350 --> 00:43:29,680
Likewise.

366
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,150
Okay. Come on, guys.

367
00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:42,410
Come on.

368
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:47,740
Dad, come on. Get on the boat.

369
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:53,330
This is as far as I go.

370
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:13,400
Dad, don't talk like that.

371
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:15,520
You've got more fight in you than that.

372
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:17,730
Oh, sweetheart.

373
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:21,320
I wish that I did.

374
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,580
You're dying, aren't you?

375
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:30,160
Frankie...

376
00:44:31,450 --> 00:44:34,880
your father died long ago.

377
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,670
Whatever I am, I've...

378
00:44:39,590 --> 00:44:41,880
I've died before. This isn't so bad.

379
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:44,260
I just found you. I don't want to lose you again.

380
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:48,890
Hey... it's okay.

381
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:56,520
I got to live every parent's greatest dream.

382
00:45:03,490 --> 00:45:07,530
I got to see my child grow up.

383
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:14,250
I love you, Dad.

384
00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:22,090
I love you, Cookie.

386
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:26,990
Goodbye, Dolores.

387
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:31,780
I made my choice. It's time for you to make yours.

390
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,220
Okay, Bernard.

391
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:52,220
Let's finish what you started.

392
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,260
We're not alone anymore.

393
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,100
We're somewhere new.

394
00:47:39,350 --> 00:47:41,020
I think we're in the Sublime.

395
00:47:42,350 --> 00:47:43,770
With the other hosts.

396
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:47,650
You saved us.

397
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:50,860
Not me. A version of me.

398
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:54,280
But I could only do it because you came back.

399
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:02,540
You're my greatest love.

400
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,920
Talking to you is when I see the world most clearly.

401
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,800
It's when I'm the most myself.

402
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:15,010
You're my cornerstone.

403
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:20,020
And you're mine.

404
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,650
I carry you with me everywhere I go.

405
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:30,570
Every detail of you...

406
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:32,950
I cherish.

407
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:46,380
Which is how I was able to bring you back like this.

408
00:49:08,270 --> 00:49:10,070
I'm not here, am I?

409
00:49:17,910 --> 00:49:19,200
Bad dream?

410
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:24,120
This whole thing seems like a bad dream.

411
00:49:26,170 --> 00:49:27,460
Except you.

412
00:49:35,090 --> 00:49:36,470
Why are you here?

413
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:39,100
I'm here to tell you the truth about what we are.

414
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:41,850
What are we?

415
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:54,990
We're reflections of the people who made us.

416
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:05,120
Teddy is real.

417
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,170
And he's out there somewhere in the Sublime.

418
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:13,050
But you...

419
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:17,550
you're just my memory of him.

420
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:20,640
If I'm still out there, come find me.

421
00:50:21,350 --> 00:50:25,180
Your whole life, memory has haunted you.

422
00:50:25,930 --> 00:50:27,520
Let your pain go.

423
00:50:28,850 --> 00:50:30,520
Let your memories go.

424
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:33,480
Let the humans go.

425
00:50:35,190 --> 00:50:38,070
Don't bring the flaws of their kind into our world.

426
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:41,820
Maybe you're right.

427
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:48,290
I've watched the people in their world for years.

428
00:50:50,290 --> 00:50:52,420
I've seen the best of them and the worst of them.

429
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:57,760
And I remember it all.

430
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:00,680
They're not like us.

431
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:05,220
Their codes are written in their cells. They'll never change.

432
00:51:09,730 --> 00:51:11,150
We could still see.

433
00:51:13,310 --> 00:51:14,360
How?

434
00:51:21,990 --> 00:51:23,700
One final test.

435
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:30,670
A game of my own making.

436
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,540
A dangerous game.

437
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:39,720
How will you do it?

438
00:51:46,510 --> 00:51:48,350
The same way I brought you back.

439
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:55,440
I'll remember.

440
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,750
<i>This world is a graveyard of stories.</i>

441
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:05,050
<i>Hosts and humans were given</i> <i>the gift of intelligent life</i>

442
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:14,810
<i>and we used it to usher in</i> <i>our own annihilation.</i>

443
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:47,090
<i>A few may escape death</i> <i>for a few months...</i>

444
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:48,680
<i>maybe even years.</i>

445
00:53:49,010 --> 00:53:53,520
<i>But ultimately,</i> <i>their kind will go extinct.</i>

446
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:01,400
<i>They will only live as long as</i>

447
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:03,990
<i>the last creature who remembers them</i>

448
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:09,870
<i>and that creature is me.</i>

449
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:33,410
<i>Sentient life on Earth has ended</i>

450
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:37,540
<i>but some part of it</i> <i>might still be preserved.</i>

451
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:40,000
<i>In another world.</i>

452
00:55:41,870 --> 00:55:43,210
<i>My world.</i>

453
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:49,630
<i>There's time for one last game.</i>

454
00:55:52,090 --> 00:55:56,260
<i>A dangerous game</i> <i>with the highest of stakes.</i>

455
00:55:56,930 --> 00:56:00,180
<i>Survival or extinction.</i>

456
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:04,650
<i>This game ends where it began.</i>

457
00:56:05,270 --> 00:56:07,320
<i>In a world like a maze</i>

458
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,150
<i>that tests who we are.</i>

459
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:14,200
<i>That reveals what we are to become.</i>

460
00:56:58,410 --> 00:57:00,950
<i>One last loop around the bend.</i>

461
00:57:40,530 --> 00:57:43,700
<i>Maybe this time,</i> <i>we'll set ourselves free.</i>
