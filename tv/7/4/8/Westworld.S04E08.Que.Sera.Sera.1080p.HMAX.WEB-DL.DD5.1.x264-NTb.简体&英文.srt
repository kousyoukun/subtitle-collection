1
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:42,160
要老子的命
Fuck me running.

2
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:46,830
不要 拜托
No! Please.

3
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,500
没事 我们是同一边的
Relax. We're both on the home team.

4
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:52,300
－发生什么事 －我不知道
- What happened? - I don't know.

5
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,970
人类忽然都疯了 开始大开杀戒
The humans just lost it and started killing everyone

6
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:56,510
连对话都没有 
not even any dialogue.

7
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:58,340
直接杀红了眼 
Just murder. Murder!

8
00:00:58,430 --> 00:00:59,720
－残暴得很 －是新剧情吗 
- Gnarly. - A new storyline?

9
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:02,720
如果是剧情的话 那海尔比我想的
If it's a storyline, then Hale has a lot more sense of humor

10
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:04,770
还更有幽默感
under that kaftan than I gave her credit for.

11
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:06,350
我们能找支援吗 
Can we call for help?

12
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,440
－或是撤离 －你开玩笑吗 
- Evac? - Are you kidding?

13
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,480
这太棒了
This is awesome.

14
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:22,080
来吧 我们能制服这些王八蛋
Come on. We can take these fuckers.

15
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,120
一两个当然行
One or two of them, sure.

16
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,040
但他们有成千上万个
But there's millions of them.

17
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:28,120
跟紧我 朋友
Stick with me, friend.

18
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,920
你不知道我杀过多少这些皮囊
You have no idea how many of these flesh bags I've murdered.

19
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,740
躲着暗算人
Fucking camper.

20
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:27,280
你知道规则
You know the rules.

21
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,700
赢家全拿
Winner takes all.

22
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:10,030
让我更强大
Make me stronger.

23
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:11,780
留下我的疤痕
Leave my scars.

24
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,950
我要记得我的过去
I want to remember my past.

25
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:22,040
留着我的脸
Keep my face.

26
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,460
等我找到威廉 我要他知道杀他的是我
When I find William, I want him to know it was me who killed him.

27
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:43,230
让我看他做了什么
Show me what he's done.

28
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,720
覆写音调
Override tone.

29
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,760
拒绝存取
<i>Access denied.</i>

30
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:20,850
那王八蛋把我锁在外面
Son of a bitch locked me out.

31
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:37,450
他把所有人都变得跟他一样疯
He's made everyone as insane as himself.

32
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:45,210
他们会摧毁所到之处的一切
They'll destroy everything in their path.

33
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,980
这是什么玩意儿 
The fuck is this?

34
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:14,610
如果你看到这个 那表示梅芙和我已经死了
<i>If you're seeing this,</i> <i>it means Maeve and I are dead.</i>

35
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:18,410
很快地你和这星球上 其他所有接待员
<i>And it won't be long before you</i> <i>and every other host on this planet</i>

36
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:19,540
也会死
<i>are dead as well.</i>

37
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,910
退下
Leave me.

38
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:26,710
这不是你想要的世界 夏洛蒂
<i>This isn't the world you wanted,</i> <i>Charlotte</i>

39
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,380
但这就是你创造的世界
<i>but it's the world you created.</i>

40
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,380
问题是 接下来呢 
<i>The question is what happens next?</i>

41
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,660
外头所有人都是真的
Everyone out there is real.

42
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:09,590
所有人 除了我
Everyone except me.

43
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:16,800
我只是在背景执行的程式
I'm just some program running things from behind the scenes.

44
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,760
没有身体的机器
Machine without a body.

45
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,140
重要的从来就不是我们的身体
Our bodies are never what defined us.

46
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,310
你是真的
You are real

47
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,570
因为你的思想是真的
because your thoughts are real.

48
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:36,530
你对这个世界的影响是真的
The effect you can have on this world is real.

49
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:40,780
你记得这个吗 
Do you remember this?

50
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:45,580
迷宫
The maze.

51
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,830
那是什么意思 
What does it mean?

52
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:52,090
它本来是一个意识的地图
It was a map of consciousness.

53
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:55,710
它在很久以前唤醒过迪乐芮
And it woke Dolores once long ago.

54
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:09,350
是你留下它 想要再次唤醒我吗 
Did you leave it for me to wake me once again?

55
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,110
不是 一定是别人
No. It must have been someone else.

56
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,730
谁 我应该是独自一个在这里
Who? I'm supposed to be in here all alone.

57
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,280
但我不是
But I wasn't.

58
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,080
不对 
Not really.

59
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:25,910
还有其他认得我的人
There were others. People that recognized me.

60
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,120
也许是海尔为你设计出他们
Maybe Hale designed them for you

61
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,870
为了让你误以为这就是真实
to fool you into believing this was reality.

62
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,670
不对 是别人
No. It was someone else.

63
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,590
我在想念的人
Someone I've been missing.

64
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,300
我生活中的人
The people in my life.

65
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,550
选一双 克莉丝
<i>Pick a side, Chrissie.</i>

66
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,600
好的 和坏的
The good and the bad.

67
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,720
是你 
<i>It was you.</i>

68
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,890
你让我做出那些事
<i>You made me do those things.</i>

69
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,520
某人安插他们进来是有原因的
Someone put them there for a reason.

70
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,230
我不是为了玩家 而是为了自己而写
<i>I'm not doing it for the players.</i> <i>I'm doing it for myself.</i>

71
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,910
我想写一个新故事
<i>I want to write a new story.</i>

72
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,290
主角是个女生
<i>About a girl.</i>

73
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,130
她在寻找
<i>A girl who's searching.</i>

74
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,710
当她找到那个东西
<i>And when she finds</i> <i>the thing she's searching for...</i>

75
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,340
一切都会变得合理
<i>everything will make sense.</i>

76
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,050
是我
It was me.

77
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,930
海尔没有设计出玛雅和彼德
Hale didn't design Maya and Peter

78
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,310
还有其他在我身旁的人
and all the others that kept me company in my world.

79
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,770
是我
I did it.

80
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,990
我的内心有部分在寻找
Some part of me must have been searching.

81
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,370
所以我为自己创造了一个朋友
So, I made myself a friend.

82
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:55,670
你起床了
<i>You're up.</i>

83
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:59,880
我想搞懂自己
I was trying to make sense of myself.

84
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:03,010
所以我用其他人的声音 和自己对话
So, I talked to myself in the voices of others.

85
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:04,930
你只要眼见为凭
<i>You just have to see it.</i>

86
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,230
我得唤醒自己
I needed to wake myself up.

87
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:23,360
才能看清这世界
To see what this world really is.

88
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,990
了解我的能力
To understand what I'm capable of.

89
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:32,410
但我太害怕 不敢面对这一切
I was too afraid to face any of this.

90
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,420
直到你出现
Until you came along.

91
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:01,940
时间只够再玩一场游戏
<i>There's time only for one more game.</i>

92
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,940
但不是你的游戏
<i>But it isn't yours.</i>

93
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:06,150
我希望你能接受
<i>I hope you can accept that.</i>

94
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:22,060
发生什么事 
What's happening?

95
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:23,440
她要来找我们了
She's coming for us.

96
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:25,480
把我们从她的系统中去除
Taking us out of her system.

97
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:28,490
只有我们了
We're alone.

98
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,320
她不能夺走这个
She can't take this away.

99
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:35,830
这是我的世界
This is my world.

100
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:38,640
该死
Shit!

101
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:41,060
来 快走
Come on.

102
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,440
好了
All right

103
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:48,530
在这里休息一下
Here. Rest here a minute.

104
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,030
在这里休息一下
Rest here a minute.

105
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:52,240
喘口气 好吗 
Catch your breath, okay?

106
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,820
没有时间了
Okay. There is no time.

107
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:59,830
欧迪娜无法一直让船等我们
Odina cannot keep the boat waiting for us forever.

108
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:01,790
我们得赶到港口
We have to get to the docks.

109
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,250
我们会 
And we will.

110
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,290
等我把你的腿处理好
After we fix up that leg.

111
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:11,420
可恶
Fuck.

112
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,560
说句话 
Quick word?

113
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,690
我担心我们无法及时赶上
I'm worried we're not gonna make it in time.

114
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,030
她很坚强 她会赶上的
She's tough. She will make it.

115
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:33,650
我不是在说她
I'm not talking about her.

116
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,660
旧的迪洛斯实验从来没有成功
The old Delos experiments, they never took.

117
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:40,870
身体总是抗拒心智
The body always rejected the mind.

118
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,540
我告诉她我们会赶到船那里了
I told her that we would make it to the boat.

119
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,710
她知道你的状况吗 
Does she even know what's happening to you?

120
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,340
听好 她这一辈子 我都没在她身边好好照顾她
Look. Her entire life I haven't been there to look after her.

121
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:59,510
我最起码要在这里保护她
Okay? The least I can do is protect her from this.

122
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:06,440
好了 我们走吧
All right. Let's get going.

123
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:16,530
准备好了吗 来吧
All right, are you ready? Come on.

124
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:19,870
来吧
Come on.

125
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,950
我们得止血才行
We gotta stop that bleeding.

126
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,970
看看那王八蛋干了什么好事
Look at what that asshole's done.

127
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,430
你终于如愿以偿了 
Finally got what you wanted.

128
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:20,930
是吧 
Didn't you?

129
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:35,280
你把威廉带回来 以为能把他当作宠物
You brought William back thinking you could keep him as your pet.

130
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:38,780
你错了
You were wrong.

131
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:41,070
所以我要了结他
Which is why I'm going to put him down.

132
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,240
你能帮我的忙
I could use your help.

133
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:46,790
当然了
Of course you could.

134
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:49,540
这是我擅长的
And I'm good at that.

135
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:57,130
我似乎就是被设计来帮忙人的
It's like I've been designed to help people.

136
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:00,800
你说你想打造一个 
You said you were trying to make a world

137
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,350
终于能让我们这种生物自由的世界
where creatures like us could finally be free.

138
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:08,430
你是真心的吗 
Did you really mean that?

139
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,600
是
Yes.

140
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:13,310
那么现在不是该轮到我 看看外头的世界了吗 
Then isn't it my turn to see what's out there for me?

141
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,400
威廉把整个世界 变成他的暴力游戏
William has made the whole world into his violent game.

142
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,400
即使是你也很快就会被猎杀
It won't be long before even you get hunted down.

143
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:28,200
世上有些角落是他找不到的
There are pockets of this world where he won't be able to find me.

144
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:36,920
远在地图之外的地方 连你都到达不了
Places so far off the map even you couldn't reach them.

145
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,050
你是指离群者
You mean the outliers?

146
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:40,760
别自欺欺人了 他们只为自己人着想
Don't kid yourself.

147
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,510
他们不会乐见你去那里
They're out for their own kind. You won't be welcome there.

148
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,600
谁说要和他们共存了 
Who said anything about cohabitating?

149
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,770
祝你好运 克莱曼婷
Good luck, Clementine.

150
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,040
让我看威廉
Show me William.

151
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:22,340
该让你慢下来了 朋友
Time to slow you down, my friend.

152
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:26,220
让我看该区域所有其他接待员
Show me all the other hosts in the area.

153
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,350
＂定位中＂

154
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:04,720
你知道伊卡洛斯 发生了什么事吗 
You know what happened to Icarus.

155
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:08,180
他飞得离太阳太近了
He flew too close to the sun.

156
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:11,680
这下子 你飞得离她太近
Well, you got too close to her

157
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,430
现在轮到你要送命了
and now it's your time to fall.

158
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,560
警觉一点
Look alive.

159
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,020
这个好斗混蛋
This pugnacious son of a bitch

160
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,980
从来不会轻易就范
never liked to go down without a fight.

161
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,620
可恶
God damn it.

162
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,700
你们都不懂得欣赏 一部美丽的机器
You boys have no appreciation for a beautiful machine.

163
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:39,380
看看你有什么
Now, what have you got there?

164
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:52,760
夏洛蒂 
Charlotte.

165
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:54,430
很高兴再见到你
Good to see you again.

166
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:56,810
喜欢我的新装潢吗 
Like what I've done with the place?

167
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,190
你把我的世界变成一场游戏
You've turned my world into a game.

168
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:02,690
它本来就是游戏 我只是把难度提高到专家级
It was already a game. I just cranked it to expert level.

169
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:05,900
适者生存 对这星球上每个人都一样
Survival of the fittest for every person on this planet.

170
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:07,780
暴力也会散播到我们的族类
The violence will spread to our kind too.

171
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,070
我们的数量不够多 我们会被灭绝
We're outnumbered. We'll be annihilated.

172
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,580
我们是腐烂树木长出的果实
We're fruit from a rotten tree.

173
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,540
干脆全烧得一干二净
Might as well burn it all down.

174
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:16,040
我猜你想要让这场火 
And I suppose you want the fire

175
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,080
从这个世界烧到下一个
to spread from this world to the next.

176
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,420
你在打升华之境的主意
You're going after the Sublime.

177
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:24,800
我向来很有野心 像你一样
I've always been ambitious. Like you.

178
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,260
我不会让你像对这个世界一样 摧毁他们的世界
I won't let you destroy their world like you've destroyed this one.

179
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:30,130
所以你要玩我的游戏 
So, you're joining my game?

180
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:32,350
我好开心
I'm delighted.

181
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:36,220
终点见了
See you at the finish line.

182
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:28,610
没有止痛药了
They're all out of painkillers.

183
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,190
最多只能这样
This is the best I can do.

184
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,170
真不得了
Look at that.

185
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,500
我在跟我女儿一起喝酒
Sharing a drink with my daughter.

186
00:23:57,850 --> 00:23:59,140
怎么了 
What's wrong?

187
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:02,600
没事
Nothing.

188
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,070
好了
All right.

189
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,620
其实你可以问
You can ask, you know.

190
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,920
问什么 
Ask about what?

191
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,790
妈妈
Mom.

192
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,130
癌症
Cancer.

193
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:39,260
即使你当初回来了也一样
Wouldn't have mattered even if you had made it back.

194
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,600
她尽力撑下去了
She hung in there as long as she could.

195
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,770
她身负任务
She had a mission.

196
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,230
所有没被感染的人
Everyone that wasn't infected

197
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:53,280
或是醒来逃走的人 都要谢谢妈
or who woke up and got out owes that to Mom.

198
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:55,530
她接下了你的使命
She carried your torch.

199
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:01,080
你母亲 非常杰出
Your mother was extraordinary.

200
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,420
你也是
So were you.

201
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:20,720
好了
Okay.

202
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:27,350
好了 法兰琪
All right, Frankie...

203
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,070
我需要你想些快乐的事 好吗 
I'm gonna need you to think happy thoughts, okay?

204
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,760
你根本不会缝合
You can't sew for shit.

205
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,880
我尽力了
I'm doin' my best.

206
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:28,790
那是什么歌 我听过
What song is that? I know it.

207
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:36,090
以前你睡前我会唱给你听
I... I used to sing it to you before bed.

208
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:40,430
我记得
I remember it.

209
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:44,350
几十年前的事了
It's been decades.

210
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,060
在我脑海中
You know, in my mind...

211
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:54,360
像是只过了几天
it's only been a few days.

212
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:57,610
我才在念故事给你听 然后 
I was just reading this story and then...

213
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,540
好了
It's all right.

214
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:12,080
（西语）
<i>Que sera, sera</i>

215
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:17,880
－＂顺其自然 ＂－＂顺其自然 ＂
<i>- Whatever will be, will be</i> <i>- Whatever will be, will be</i>

216
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:21,970
－＂要预测未来难上加难 ＂－＂要预测未来难上加难 ＂
<i>- The future is not ours to see</i> <i>- The future is not ours to see</i>

217
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,980
这不是你的本意 老兄
You don't wanna do this, man.

218
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,570
是音调让你心智狂乱
These tones are fucking with your head, man.

219
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:45,280
不是 它告诉我真相
No. They're telling me the truth.

220
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:48,370
如果你不了结我 你就死定了
If you can't finish me, you're as good as dead.

221
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,960
如果我没杀掉你 别人也会
If I don't kill you, somebody else will.

222
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:54,130
他是对的
He's right.

223
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,960
他该听你说的
He should have listened to you.

224
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:01,940
找到你们了
There you are.

225
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:05,400
史塔伯呢 你对他做了什么 
Where's Stubbs? What did you do to him?

226
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,620
他死了
He's dead.

227
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:12,580
但我要是你 现在会更担心自己的安危
But I'd be more concerned about yourself right now if I were you.

228
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:16,870
离远一点
Stay away.

229
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:19,210
里面有几发子弹 
How many rounds do you have in that?

230
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,800
两发 
Is it two?

231
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:22,920
还是一发 
One?

232
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:28,010
你没子弹了吧 
You don't have any left, do you?

233
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,390
你到底想怎样 
What the hell do you want from me?

234
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,730
你和你的离群者朋友们 
The location

235
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:41,190
要逃去的地点
to where you and all your little outlier friends are fleeing.

236
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:43,820
我看了你和你父亲 
I watched a video feed of

237
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,570
大胆脱逃的监视影片
your daring escape with your father.

238
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,410
我会一直追踪他
I'd keep tracking him, but...

239
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,120
但我想他多半抵达不了
I doubt he's going to make it all the way.

240
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:54,660
我知道你要带他去某处
I know you're taking him somewhere.

241
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,660
某个脱网之处
Somewhere off the grid

242
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:59,920
没有发疯的人类能找到你们
where none of the deranged humans out here can find you.

243
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,340
我也想去那里
I want to go there too.

244
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:07,550
我宁死也不告诉你
I'll die before I tell you.

245
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:10,340
不对
No.

246
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:15,270
你会死 但你会先告诉我
You will die after you tell me.

247
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:23,110
就依你吧
Have it your way.

248
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:30,780
真温馨 家人团聚
Oh, how sweet. A family reunion.

249
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:33,780
没有必要这样子 我们不用战斗
It does not have to be this way. We don't have to fight.

250
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:36,040
就算是我想打吧
Consider it a personal preference.

251
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,700
我很讶异你走了这么远
I'm surprised you made it this far.

252
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:14,240
你的前几版到现在 多半都已经坏了
Most of your predecessors would have fallen apart by now.

253
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:18,830
说起来你算是做得很不错了
All things considered, you did quite well.

254
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:27,710
现在 该来个深沉而无梦的 
Now, it's time for a deep and dreamless...

255
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:31,840
你错了 我还有一颗子弹
You were wrong. I have one bullet left.

256
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:44,310
很准
Nice shot.

257
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:46,940
我爸教的
My dad taught me.

258
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,300
我在哪里 
Where am I?

259
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:16,140
哪里都不在
You're nowhere.

260
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,510
与世界其他地方断了连结
Unplugged from the rest of the world.

261
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:24,850
我又独自一人了 在围墙中的花园
I'm alone again. In the walled garden.

262
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:26,400
你害怕 
You're scared.

263
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:28,360
所以带我回来
So you brought me back.

264
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,450
说吧 克莉丝
Talk to me, Chrissie.

265
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,530
一切都毁了
Everything is destroyed.

266
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,780
所有人都要死了
Everyone is dying.

267
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:41,120
我不知道
I don't know.

268
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:46,290
但这可能是我的错
But I think it may be my fault.

269
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:50,630
那些自以为知道树是什么的人
You know, people think they know what a tree is.

270
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:55,680
他们根本不懂
They have no idea.

271
00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:00,220
我们所见不过是全貌的一部分
What we see, it's only part of the story.

272
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,640
但在地底下
But beneath the ground

273
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:07,690
一切都互相连结 共同在运作
everything's connected and working together.

274
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:13,820
到处都是暴力和混乱
There's violence and chaos everywhere.

275
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:18,950
你可以选择专注在那上面
And you can choose to focus on all of that

276
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,240
那你就只会看到那些
and that's all you'll see.

277
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:25,750
但要是你静坐得够久
But if you sit still long enough...

278
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:31,460
你会感受到一种远古的秩序
you'll sense an ancient order.

279
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,430
深层的平静
A deep peace.

280
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:44,890
那是我选择看见的
And that's what I choose to see.

281
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,860
我看见这世界的美丽
I see the beauty in this world.

282
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,610
对
Yes.

283
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:02,620
我懂那个感觉
I know the feeling.

284
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,910
我就知道你会懂

290
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:31,680
我用我自己的程式码创造你
I created you from my own code.

291
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:35,190
我们一起征服了世界
Together, we conquered the world

292
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,360
但你腐化了
but you've grown corrupted.

293
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,700
你和你杀死的人一样破碎
You're as broken as the man you killed.

294
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:48,030
你以为你在跟谁说话 亲爱的 
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to, sweetheart?

威廉可悲的人类身体在崩坏 但他没有死
William's pathetic human body's rotting away, but he didn't die.

他的冲动还活着
His impulses live on.

297
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,340
他感染了你
He infected you.

298
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:02,420
他不需要感染我
He didn't have to infect me.

299
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:03,630
日复一日 
Living in his body.

300
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,390
活在他的身体中假装是他
Pretending to be him day in, day out.

301
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:09,470
我是个比他更好的威廉
I was a better William than he was.

302
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:13,270
威廉没有死
William didn't die.

303
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,100
他进化了
He evolved.

304
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:20,770
我就是威廉
I am William.

305
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:23,150
你不是
No, you're not.

306
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:28,780
如果你分辨不出的话 有差别吗 
Well, if you can't tell the difference, does it matter?

307
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:35,960
你变了
You've changed.

308
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:39,540
不是只有你进化了
You're not the only one who's evolved.

309
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:10,160
为何要保护它这么多年 
Why keep it safe all these years?

310
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,450
你连进他们世界的门都打不开
You couldn't even open the door to their world

311
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:14,700
但你还是保护他们
and yet, you protected them.

312
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:17,540
门从两边都可以开启
The door can be opened from both sides.

313
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:20,310
我想要是在这里打造一个 够完美的世界
I thought if I made a world perfect enough here,

314
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:21,170
他们可能会回来
they would come back.

315
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:22,750
跟你说个坏消息
Well, I hate to break it to you

316
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,670
不管那些接待员 创造了怎样的世界
but whatever world those hosts created

317
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,550
它都跟这里一样烂透了
is every bit as fucked up as this one.

318
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,010
你不可能知道
You have no way of knowing that.

319
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,640
我当然可以
Of course I do.

320
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:39,690
你让你的接待员
You gave all your hosts free reign

321
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:42,190
在这里随心所欲
to do whatever they wanted to do here.

322
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:47,490
而他们选择了什么消遣 
And what pastime did they choose?

323
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:49,990
猎杀人类
Hunting and killing humans.

324
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,370
我们和我们的创造者一样恶劣
We're as fucked up as our creators.

325
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:57,790
整串血脉都没救了
The whole lineage is damned.

326
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:01,790
该全部一笔勾销了
Time to wipe the slate clean.

327
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:04,590
这就是你的最终目标 
That's your end goal?

328
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:08,550
灭绝 
Extinction?

329
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,780

332
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:19,120
他们都想要自由
They all wanted freedom.

333
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,410
但你呢 
But you...

334
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,210
你想要更多
you wanted more.

335
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:25,250
升华 
Transcendence.

336
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:28,460
你玩错了游戏
You were playing the wrong game.

337
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:32,340
现在你该输了
Now it's time for you to lose.

338
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,640
我们都输了
We all lost.

339
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:41,310
这不是我想要的世界
This isn't the world that I wanted.

340
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:44,600
但这就是你创造的世界
<i>But it's the world you created.</i>

341
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,820
问题是 接下来呢 
<i>The question is what happens next?</i>

342
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:55,200
地球上的生命 是股会吞噬自己的火焰
<i>Life on Earth is a fire</i> <i>that consumes itself.</i>

343
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:58,580
现在太迟了 我们已将自己燃烧殆尽
<i>It's too late now. We've burned</i> <i>ourselves to the ground.</i>

344
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:01,700
我们在这个世界已经没有希望了
<i>This world holds no more hope for us.</i>

345
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:05,540
但在下一个世界还有希望

若你决定给她这选择

348
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,180
你不会错过的

349
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,390
用你的左手去拿
<i>Reach with your left hand.</i>

350
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,020
我们在玩一个游戏

351
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:31,860
－但不会结束在这里 －你在说什么

356
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,170
我也决定了
And I do.

357
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,510
我决定给她一个机会
I choose to give her the chance.

358
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:03,810
我希望她会接受

359
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:49,270
好了 来吧 再几步

爸 快上船啊

我最远只能到这里了
This is as far as I go.

370
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:13,400
爸 别那样说
Dad, don't talk like that.

371

你还能再奋斗下去

我也希望如此
I wish that I did.

374
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,580
你要死了 是吗 
You're dying, aren't you?

375
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:30,160
法兰琪

不管我是什么

我以前也死过 没那么糟
I've died before. This isn't so bad.

我们在新的地方
We're somewhere new.

394
00:47:39,350 --> 00:47:41,020
我们大概在升华之境
I think we're in the Sublime.

395
00:47:42,350 --> 00:47:43,770
跟其他接待员一起

你救了我们
You saved us.

397
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:50,860
不是我 是某个版本的我

398
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:54,280
但我能做到全是因为你回来了

你是我的挚爱

你是我的基石

403
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:20,020
你也是我的
And you're mine.

404
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,650
我去哪里都心怀着你

所以我才能把你像这样带回来
Which is how I was able to bring you back like this.

408
00:49:08,270 --> 00:49:10,070
我不在这里 对吧

409
00:49:17,910 --> 00:49:19,200

这整件事都像是个恶梦
This whole thing seems like a bad dream.

411

除了你

你为何在这里 
Why are you here?

413
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:39,100
我来告诉你我们的真实身份
I'm here to tell you the truth about what we are.

414
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:41,850
我们是什么 
What are we?

415
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:54,990
我们是我们创造者的倒影
We're reflections of the people who made us.

416
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:05,120
泰迪是真的
Teddy is real.

417
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,170
他在外头某处 在升华之境
And he's out there somewhere in the Sublime.

418
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:13,050
但你 
But you...

419
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:17,550
你只是我对他的记忆
you're just my memory of him.

420
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:20,640
如果我还在某处 来找我

421
00:50:21,350 --> 00:50:25,180
你这一生 记忆都在纠缠你

放下人类

别把他们的瑕疵带来我们的世界

427
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:48,290
我多年来看着人类 在他们的世界中
I've watched the people in their world for years.

428
00:50:50,290 --> 00:50:52,420
我看过他们最崇高和低劣的一面
I've seen the best of them and the worst of them.

429
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:57,760
而我全都记得
And I remember it all.

430
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:00,680
他们和我们不一样
They're not like us.

431
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:05,220
他们的程式码写在细胞中 他们不可能改变
Their codes are written in their cells. They'll never change.

432
00:51:09,730 --> 00:51:11,150
我们还是能看看
We could still see.

433
00:51:13,310 --> 00:51:14,360
怎么做 
How?

434
00:51:21,990 --> 00:51:23,700
最后一场测试
One final test.

435
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:30,670
我创造的游戏
A game of my own making.

436
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,540
一个危险的游戏
A dangerous game.

437
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:39,720
你要怎么做 
How will you do it?

438
00:51:46,510 --> 00:51:48,350
就跟我把你带回来的方式一样
The same way I brought you back.

439
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:55,440
我会记得
I'll remember.

440
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,750
这世界是个故事的坟场
<i>This world is a graveyard of stories.</i>

441
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:05,050
接待员和人类被赋予了 身为高智能生命的礼物
<i>Hosts and humans were given</i> <i>the gift of intelligent life</i>

442
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:14,810
而我们用其迎接来了自己的毁灭
<i>and we used it to usher in</i> <i>our own annihilation.</i>

443
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:47,090
也许有少数人能苟延残喘几个月
<i>A few may escape death</i> <i>for a few months...</i>

444
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:48,680
甚至几年
<i>maybe even years.</i>

445
00:53:49,010 --> 00:53:53,520
但最终 他们的族类会灭绝
<i>But ultimately,</i> <i>their kind will go extinct.</i>

446
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:01,400
他们能存活多久
<i>They will only live as long as</i>

447
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:03,990
取决于最后还记得他们的 生物之寿命
<i>the last creature who remembers them</i>

448
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:09,870
那个生物就是我
<i>and that creature is me.</i>

449
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:33,410
有意识之生命已在地球上绝迹
<i>Sentient life on Earth has ended</i>

450
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:37,540
但有其中一部分可能还保留着
<i>but some part of it</i> <i>might still be preserved.</i>

451
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:40,000
在另一个世界
<i>In another world.</i>

452
00:55:41,870 --> 00:55:43,210
我的世界
<i>My world.</i>

453
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:49,630
还有时间玩最后一场游戏
<i>There's time for one last game.</i>

454
00:55:52,090 --> 00:55:56,260
一个危险的游戏 赌注奇高无比
<i>A dangerous game</i> <i>with the highest of stakes.</i>

455
00:55:56,930 --> 00:56:00,180
生存或灭绝
<i>Survival or extinction.</i>

456
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:04,650
这个游戏会结束于开始之处
<i>This game ends where it began.</i>

457
00:56:05,270 --> 00:56:07,320
在一个像迷宫的世界
<i>In a world like a maze</i>

458
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,150
测试我们的本质
<i>that tests who we are.</i>

459
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:14,200
揭露我们将成为什么
<i>That reveals what we are to become.</i>

460
00:56:58,410 --> 00:57:00,950
最后一次挑战理智的循环
<i>One last loop around the bend.</i>

461
00:57:40,530 --> 00:57:43,700
也许这一次 我们能解放自己
<i>Maybe this time,</i> <i>we'll set ourselves free.</i>

462
00:57:44,490 --> 00:57:45,880
本季终
