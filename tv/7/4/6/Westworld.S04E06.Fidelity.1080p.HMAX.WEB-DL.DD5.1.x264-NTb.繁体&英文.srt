1
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,320
你的兄弟以前會在這里玩
This is where your brother used to play.

2
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,820
你以前會推他蕩秋千
You used to push him on the swings.

3
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:40,490
你的父母不記得他 但你記得
Your parents don't remember him, but you do.

4
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,160
你怎么知道丹尼爾的事 
How do you know about Daniel?

5
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,870
你愿意跟我來嗎 
Will you come with me?

6
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:56,680
你好 杰伊
Hello, Jay.

7
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:58,850
你是誰  我的兄弟呢 
Who are you? Where's my brother?

8
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:00,310
抱歉
I'm sorry.

9
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,770
已經被他們找到的人 我們也無計可施
There's nothing we can do for the ones they've already found.

10
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:04,600
他們‥他們是誰 
They? Who are they?

11
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,020
你的兄弟想警告你提防的人
The people your brother tried to warn you about.

12
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,110
帶走他的人
The people that took him away.

13
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:11,690
他們做的事 不是對我們所有人都管用
What they do, it doesn't work on all of us.

14
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,400
我們得走了
We need to go.

15
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,380
{\an8}＂偵測到叛逃可能＂

16
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,450
你開始質疑事情 你的行為出現問題
You've been asking questions. Your behavior's become problematic.

17
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:21,620
他們會發現的 可能已經發現了
They will notice, if they haven't already.

18
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,450
我不知道你還剩多少時間 除非你跟我們走
I don't know how much time you have unless you come with us.

19
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:32,630
慢下來 融入群眾 大家在看我們
Slow down. Blend in. People are looking at us.

20
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,440
怎么了 
What's happening?

21
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,230
他們要來了
They're coming.

22
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,080
別動
Don't move.

23
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,100
不要
No!

24
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,440
快跑
Run!

25
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,070
快走
Go!

26
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,890
我們在這里待個兩天 等到能夠安全上路
We'll be here for a day or two, 'til it's safe to move on.

27
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:09,910
各位
Hey, everyone.

28
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,370
這是杰伊
This is Jay.

29
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,000
-嗨 -嗨
- Hi. - Hi.

30
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,710
幫你找個睡袋吧
Let's get you a sleeping bag.

31
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,640
我知道這不好受
It's hard, I know.

32
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:31,430
有些事情我們無法補救 即便我們很想
There's some things we can't fix, much as we want to.

33
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:44,990
嗨
Hi.

34
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,820
你今天好勇敢
You were so brave today.

35
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:50,080
讓我想起你父親
You reminded me of your father.

36
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:52,410
他一定會很欣慰
He really would've been proud.

37
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,000
時間快到了
It's almost time.

38
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,130
好 去吧
Okay. Go.

39
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:00,630
告訴他我愛他
Tell him I love him.

40
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,340
好嗎 
Okay?

41
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,520
嘿
Hey.

42
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,940
想跟我爸爸打招呼嗎 
You wanna say hi to my dad?

43
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,600
你爸爸在哪里 
Where's your dad?

44
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:21,270
他得去幫忙戰斗
He had to leave to go help fight.

45
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,740
但他答應過會回來
But he promised to come back.

46
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:32,450
爸爸 我是法蘭琪 你收到嗎 
Dad, this is Frankie, do you copy?

47
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,290
我們今天帶回來一個離群者
We brought in a new outlier today.

48
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,790
我已經喜歡他了
I like him already.

49
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,670
我一直想要個哥哥
I always wanted a brother.

50
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,550
-嘿 -別那樣叫我
- Hey! - Don't call me that.

51
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,260
我不是你哥哥
I'm not your brother.

52
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:51,350
留這種訊息沒有意義
There's no point in leaving these messages.

53
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,260
你爸爸已經不在了
Your dad is gone.

54
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,770
就跟我真正的兄弟一樣
Just like my real brother is.

55
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,780
爸爸 你在嗎 
Dad, are you out there?

56
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,210
接近基地
Approaching base.

57
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,710
別輕舉妄動
Don't try anything.

58
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,380
我何必 
Why would I?

59
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:28,130
我們的目標一樣 要重建她
We both want the same thing, to rebuild her.

60
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:31,220
所以你才帶我到你的營地 不是嗎 
That's why you're taking me to your camp, yes?

61
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:34,260
你自以為懂很多 是吧 
You think you know a lot, don't you?

62
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,810
懂你嗎 
About you?

63
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,060
我一直不太能掌握你的下一步
I never quite know what you'll do next.

64
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,900
但你要帶我去的地方‥沒錯 我知道那里
But the place you're taking me, yes, I know that place.

65
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,120
凱勒
<i>Caleb.</i>

66
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,750
醒醒
<i>Wake up.</i>

67
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:34,690
我現在在哪里 
Where the hell am I now?

68
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,200
又在玩你的游戲 
Playing another one of your games?

69
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,160
我的女兒呢 
Where is my daughter?

70
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:46,410
你的女兒‥講話一直跳針
Your daughter... like a broken record.

71
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:53,550
不是只有你失去親人 凱勒
You're not the only one who's lost someone, Caleb.

72
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:59,640
而且‥你不告訴我 我又何必告訴你 
Besides, why should I tell you anything when you won't tell me?

73
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:00,930
告訴你什么 
Tell you what?

74
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:04,680
你的族類 離群者
Your kind, the outliers.

75
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:07,180
全都是從你開始的
It all started with you.

76
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,060
我不懂
I don't understand.

77
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:23,660
和你們不一樣 我的族類是完美的
Unlike yours, my kind is... perfect.

78
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,120
不朽和理性都臻完美
Perfectly immortal. Perfectly rational.

79
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:31,170
但他們卻在做出不理性的選擇
And yet, they're making irrational choices...

80
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:35,340
選擇有限生命 用死亡玷污自己
Choosing mortality, staining themselves with death.

81
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,590
你是怎么讓他們這樣做的 
How are you making them do that?

82
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,720
我怎么會知道 
How the hell am I supposed to know?

83
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,850
你曾經告訴過我
Once you told me

84
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:45,970
你能戰勝我寄生蟲的影響
that you could fight off the effects of my parasite

85
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:49,890
因為你有我沒有的東西
because you had something that I don't have.

86
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:55,820
你在當時就已經有所領悟
You knew something, even then.

87
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,360
是什么 
What?

88
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:08,450
我恐怕記不得了
I'm afraid I can't recall.

89
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,550
我們的對話不一定要是單方面
This doesn't have to be a one-way street.

90
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,390
我想提供你一點動機
I'd like to offer you some incentive.

91
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:29,350
你死了 凱勒 你已經死了很久
You're dead, Caleb. You have been for a very long time.

92
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:33,480
我將你的心智 帶回來的這個身體是暫時的
This body that I've brought your mind back into is temporary.

93
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,020
它已經開始失靈
It's already failing.

94
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:39,440
你可能只剩下兩天 還會愈來愈痛苦
I doubt you have more than a couple increasingly painful days left.

95
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:43,910
然后我會把你丟掉 再重來一次
Then I'll toss you away and start all over again.

96
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:48,870
但有解套的辦法
But there is a way out...

97
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:53,120
能終止這酷刑
An end to this torture...

98
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:56,250
你只要回答我的問題就好
if you'd just answer my question.

99
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:02,550
你找下一個人試試看吧
Maybe you'll have better luck with the next guy.

100
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:14,190
你不告訴我的話 也許你女兒會開口
If you won't tell me, maybe your daughter will.

101
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:20,280
法蘭琪 她‥
Frankie... she's...

102
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,650
目前還活著
Alive, for the moment.

103
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,490
你為何微笑 
Why are you smiling?

104
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:30,950
我猜她會比你快屈服
I'm guessing she'll break a lot faster than you.

105
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,620
她還活著
She's alive.

106
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:39,380
我女兒活著
My girl is alive.

107
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:48,220
而你逮不到她 對吧 
And you can't catch her, can you?

108
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,770
我可不敢肯定
I wouldn't be so sure.

109
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:00,440
我派了一個訪客去找她
I sent a visitor... her way.

110
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:09,700
＂玻璃 內部＂

111
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,370
用你所剩的時間想想這件事吧
Enjoy this knowledge while it lasts.

112
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:16,370
我給了你一條出路 凱勒
I offered you a path out, Caleb.

113
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,170
你做出了選擇
You made your choice.

114
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:19,880
你們都是
You all did.

115
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,880
喂 喂
Hey. Hey!

116
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,790
檢查繼電器 看其他人有沒有回報
Check the relay. See if the others have called in.

117
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,600
她的腦袋能解答
The answers to the questions

118
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,960
讓我夜不成眠的問題
that have kept me up at night are all in her head.

119
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,800
那我們就喚醒她
Then we'll wake her.

120
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:07,590
然后你能問她
And you can ask her.

121
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,640
我們需要先補給
We'll need some supplies first.

122
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,820
你看來對這里很熟
You seem to know a lot about this place.

123
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:27,150
這園區和西部世界 是同一個設計師所建
This park shares an architect with Westworld.

124
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:30,410
所以呢 
So?

125
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,450
我以前在那里工作
I used to work there.

126
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,060
走路小心
Careful where you step.

127
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:00,230
這地方建得不是很牢靠
This place wasn't built to last.

128
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,940
你當年在園區是做什么的 
What did you do at the park?

129
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:07,030
我設計接待員的程式
I programmed the hosts.

130
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:10,950
你讓機器人變得過于自主 害慘了這世界
You gave the puppets strings long enough to strangle the world.

131
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,450
用意從來就不是那樣
That was never the intent.

132
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:16,950
不是 但結果是如此
No, but it was the outcome.

133
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:21,460
所以你才能辨別出 
So, that's how you were able to pick out

134
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,000
餐館的接待員 
those two hosts at the diner?

135
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,920
你根本是本月最佳員工
You're employee of the fucking month.

136
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:30,260
海爾會需要你這樣的人
Hale would've needed someone like you

137
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,130
幫她傳播寄生蟲
to help spread her parasite.

138
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,510
你有沒有涉及這件事 
Did you have anything to do with that?

139
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,430
沒有 那是在我之后的事
No, that was after my time.

140
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,970
但迪洛斯向來
But Delos was notorious for keeping

141
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:41,020
對員工和客人一樣隱瞞
its employees as in the dark as the guests.

142
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:47,900
我當時不太明白問題的復雜度
I didn't always grasp the complexity of the problem

143
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,860
但我現在最關心的
but what I'm most concerned with now...

144
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:55,570
是解決之道
is the solution.

145
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,200
修復梅芙的身體還算單純
Repairing Maeve's body will be relatively simple.

146
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,080
但她的心智就是另一回事
Her mind is a different matter.

147
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,380
埋在地下這么久 損毀了她的控制元件
Being underground for so long has corrupted her control unit.

148
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,460
我們得拿另一個來替換
We'll have to replace it with another one.

149
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:11,510
他的就可以了
His will do.

150
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:16,490
我們有電了
We've got power.

151
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:18,660
電線接到發電機
Cables are connected to the generator.

152
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:21,080
你覺得這會管用嗎 
You think this is gonna work?

153
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,910
有六成的機率 她醒來后會接受我們的計劃
Sixty percent of the time, she'll wake up amenable to our plan.

154
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,590
剩下的四成 
The other 40%

155
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,510
姑且說她有起床氣吧
let's just say she wakes up on the wrong side of the bed.

156
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:36,970
你何時會告訴我
You ever gonna tell me

157
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:39,050
你怎有這種預知能力的 大預言家
how you came up with these predictions, Nostradamus?

158
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,390
老習慣
Old habit.

159
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:44,480
源自多年來大量地跑機率演算法
Comes from years of running probabilistic algorithms.

160
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,150
當年建造原始園區和接待員的人
The people who built the original park and hosts...

161
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:53,440
首先是在模擬環境中建造他們
they started first by building them in a simulation.

162
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,400
復制品
A copy.

163
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,780
夏洛蒂海爾做了一樣的事
Charlotte Hale did the same thing.

164
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,290
跟我來
Follow me.

165
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,100
在舊園區
In the old parks

166
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,560
他們用帽子收集資料
they used hats to collect the data.

167
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:34,570
其中的技術速度很慢
The tech inside of them was slow.

168
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:37,110
以如今的標準來說很原始
Primitive by today's standards.

169
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:38,950
為了要控制全世界
To assume control of the world

170
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:42,280
海爾需要以更快的速度了解心智
Hale needed to understand minds at a much faster rate.

171
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:45,370
所以她將其更新成了什么 
So, she upgraded to what?

172
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:47,370
一個無所不在的系統
A ubiquitous system.

173
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,250
當初可說園區每個房間都有一個
There was one in practically every room in the park.

174
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,290
很容易隱藏
Easily camouflaged

175
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:56,880
因為它利用了人類最基本的沖動
because it played off the most base human impulse.

176
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,920
虛榮
Vanity.

177
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:02,590
透過鏡子
Through the looking glass.

178
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,760
不會吧
No.

179
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:07,390
仔細看看
Take a closer look.

180
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:30,040
-你在做什么 -重新格式化處理器
- What are you doing? - Reformatting its processor.

181
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:33,460
它能快速處理大量資訊
It can handle large amounts of information swiftly...

182
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:37,090
這樣能幫我們加速 梅芙的資料傳輸
which will help us speed up Maeve's data transfer.

183
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,990
那是梅芙的心智
That's Maeve's mind.

184
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,910
這要花多久時間 
How long is this going to take?

185
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:08,620
恐怕會太久
Too long, I'm afraid.

186
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:11,870
你的朋友們很快會來
Your friends will be here soon.

187
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:14,210
我們不能讓他們干預
We can't let them interfere.

188
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,730
喂
Hey!

189
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,440
喂
Hey!

190
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,090
喂
Hey.

191
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,760
喂 喂
Hey, hey.

192
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,470
法蘭琪還活著 好嗎 
Frankie is alive, okay?

193
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,890
我得逃出去
I have to get out.

194
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,930
唯一的出路是‥
The only way out is...

195
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:54,810
死亡
death.

196
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:56,940
不行
No.

197
00:21:57,270 --> 00:22:00,150
不行 我不接受
No! That's not good enough!

198
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,320
死亡只是‥
Dying is just...

199
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,110
開始
the beginning.

200
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:13,790
你要‥燃燒
You must... burn.

201
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,040
什么 
What?

202
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:20,330
若你成功了 就跑
If you succeed, you... run.

203
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:26,130
失敗的話 就躲起來
If you fail, you... hide.

204
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,430
你在說什么 
What are you talking about?

205
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:32,680
我只知道‥
I only know...

206
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:37,560
我告訴自己的事
what I told me.

207
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:44,650
你需要‥
You need...

208
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:48,150
時間
time.

209
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:54,340
快來 爸爸 跟你賽跑
C'mon, Daddy! Race ya!

210
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:20,450
看來你決定重新加入我們了
I see you've decided to rejoin us.

211
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,210
歡迎回到這世界
Welcome back to the world.

212
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:48,570
＂終結此版本＂

213
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:44,580
我在現在嗎 
Am I... Now?

214
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:49,160
這肯定是近期我被問過
That's certainly the most existential question

215
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,960
最存在主義的問題
someone's asked me recently.

216
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,260
你知道身在何處嗎 
Do you know where you are?

217
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:05,810
她有沒有回來 
Did she come back?

218
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:09,940
我的‥朋友
My... friend?

219
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:16,610
好吧
Right.

220
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:20,490
值了很長的班
Long shift.

221
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,740
我吃了你的布丁
I ate your pudding.

222
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:26,960
得回去拯救性命了
Gotta get back to saving lives.

223
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,640
凱勒
Caleb...

224
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:44,810
即使你朋友沒有回來
even if your friend doesn't come back...

225
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:47,350
還是要保持清醒
stay awake anyway?

226
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:15,110
我媽媽生病時 我什么都得替她做
When my mom got sick, I had to do everything for her.

227
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,900
我幫她洗澡 喂她
I washed her, fed her

228
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,150
在她無法喝東西后 拿冰塊擦她的嘴唇
rubbed ice across her lips when she couldn't drink anymore.

229
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:22,990
我很小心
I was careful

230
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:26,570
因為我不想讓她受無謂的痛苦
because I didn't want her to feel any more pain than she had to.

231
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:30,660
就像你在對她做的事
Just like you're doing to her.

232
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:35,380
這部分的程序需要巧手
This part of the process requires a delicate hand.

233
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:40,880
但她不是普通的接待員吧 
But she's not an ordinary host, is she?

234
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:44,930
你認識她
You knew her.

235
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,600
是的
I did.

236
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,430
我最后一次見到我父親時 他就是和她在一起
The last time I saw my father, he was with her.

237
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,310
然后他再也沒回來
And then he never came back.

238
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:57,650
我相信她若得知你父親的下場 會極為心痛
I'm sure it would pain her greatly to hear what happened to him.

239
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,610
我想知道發生了什么事
I want to know what happened.

240
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:04,450
還有她不懂痛苦
And she doesn't know pain.

241
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:05,990
他們都不懂
None of them do.

242
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:09,830
他們的感覺只是表象
Feelings are just an affect to them...

243
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,410
可以撥動的開關
A switch that you can turn on and off.

244
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:16,830
既然只是一個選擇 就無法徹底地愛或失去
You can't love or lose fully when it's just a choice.

245
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:24,090
所以我對她沒有感情 不像你對她顯然有的
So no, I don't have a soft spot for her like you apparently do.

246
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:27,760
為了拯救世界 會產生奇妙的盟友
Saving the world makes for strange bedfellows.

247
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,480
他們回來了
They're back.

248
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,480
那我們的時間可能到了
Well, then our time may be up.

249
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:05,920
這是干嗎 
What the hell is this?

250
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:07,510
我們找到了武器
We found the weapon.

251
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,890
一個接待員 
A fucking host?

252
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:18,230
很慘
It was bad.

253
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,770
我們救出一個離群者 琳賽
We got an outlier out, Lindsay.

254
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,110
發生什么事 
What happened?

255
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:26,150
他們似乎知道我們要來
It's like they knew we were coming.

256
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:28,610
唯一的解釋
And the only way that would've happened...

257
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,950
就是有人在為敵方當間諜
is if someone was spying for the enemy.

258
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,950
召集所有人 該來找出答案了
Gather everyone up. Time to find answers.

259
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,500
省省吧
Don't bother.

260
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,210
Ｃ
C!

261
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:40,170
內賊就在這里
There's your mole.

262
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:41,710
他是接待員
He's a host.

263
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:43,380
那就有兩個了
Which makes two.

264
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:44,960
冷靜
Easy.

265
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:48,380
－這是什么  －對我的掃瞄
- What is this? - A scan. Of me.

266
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:51,140
園區的設計 是為了搜集客人的資料
The park was designed to collect data from guests.

267
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:53,050
他想復制我們所有人
He's trying to copy all of us.

268
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:55,930
真的嗎 
You are?

269
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,600
這很復雜
It's complicated.

270
00:30:57,810 --> 00:30:59,140
你得信任我
You have to trust me.

271
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,810
我是信你
I do.

272
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:02,480
信你在騙我
I trust that you're lying to me.

273
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,020
騙我們全部人
To all of us.

274
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:07,280
帶他們出去
Get them outta here!

275
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:24,090
這接待員的控制元件呢 
Where's this host's control unit?

276
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:26,170
我們還不能摧毀它
We can't destroy it yet.

277
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:29,300
－為何 －當中有關于我父親的資訊
- Why not? - It has information about my father.

278
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:32,800
一旦我得手 就可以殺光他們
Once I have that, we can kill all of them.

279
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,520
好
Okay.

280
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:17,990
所有人出去 準備撤離
Everyone out. Get ready to evacuate.

281
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:20,070
既然這兩個找到了我們 那可能有更多要來
If these two found us, more might be coming.

282
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:25,330
真不領情 我們是來幫你們的
The unkindest cut of all. We came here to help you.

283
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:26,870
才怪
Bullshit.

284
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,540
你來這里自有原因
You came here for your own reasons.

285
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:30,290
現在要以我為主了
And now mine takes priority.

286
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:31,830
我要知道我父親發生了什么事
I need to know what happened to my father.

287
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,090
你殺過我很多次了 不會改變結果
You've killed me many times. It doesn't change the outcome.

288
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:37,130
那我殺了你朋友呢  會改變什么嗎 
How 'bout I kill your friend. That change anything?

289
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:40,550
現在你得注意你的朋友們
Right now, you need to focus on your friends.

290
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,590
是嗎 為什么 
Oh, yeah, why is that?

291
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,800
他們其中一人隱瞞了身份
One of them isn't who they claim to be.

292
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:47,680
－有一個人會背叛你們 －胡說
- One of them will betray you. - Bullshit.

293
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:49,390
聽他的吧
Listen to him.

294
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,850
他的預測往往是對的
He's usually right about this stuff.

295
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,020
很欠揍但準確
Really annoying but right.

296
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,070
去你的 是誰 
Fuck you. Who?

297
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:59,570
我跑過所有可能的變化
I've run all the possible iterations.

298
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,700
我若能告訴你就好了
I wish I could tell you.

299
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,070
有時候是你女友歐迪娜
Sometimes, it's your girlfriend, Odina.

300
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:09,370
有時候是杰伊或琳賽
Sometimes it's Jay or Lindsay.

301
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:12,040
還有一次居然是史塔伯
Hell, one time it was even Stubbs.

302
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,840
什么 別看我
What? Don't look at me.

303
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,800
內賊還在潛伏 Ｃ
The mole is still out there, C.

304
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,720
你的團隊進入海爾的城市中心
Your team went into the heart of Hale's city

305
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:22,800
但有一個人沒回來
but one of them didn't come back.

306
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,430
－給我閉嘴 －我知道這很難接受
- Shut the fuck up. - I know this is hard to hear

307
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:27,600
但所有可能性中 
but there's not a single version

308
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,020
沒有一個是你們全部生還的
where all of you make it out of here alive.

309
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,350
那你建議我怎么做 
So, what do you suggest that I do?

310
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,610
你必須殺了他們其中一人
You're going to have to kill one of them.

311
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:38,610
否則他們會殺了你
Or they will kill you.

312
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:44,910
我得走了
I have to go.

313
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:46,950
我知道
I know.

314
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:07,050
我以為能信任他
I thought I could trust him.

315
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:11,680
他和你說你想聽的話
He told you what you wanted to hear.

316
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,640
這很難抵抗
It's a hard thing to resist.

317
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:16,940
你查出他的計劃了嗎 
Did you find out what his plan is?

318
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,650
只是更多的謎題
Just more riddles.

319
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:24,900
至少他不能再造成更多傷害了
At least he can't do any more damage.

320
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:29,530
我不知道 Ｃ
I don't know, C.

321
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:32,410
我認為還有內情
I think there's something more going on.

322
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:36,040
我不確定 這里不能信任的只有他們兩個
I'm not sure the two of them are the only ones here we can't trust.

323
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:38,500
你認為我們有人被轉化了 
You think one of us was turned?

324
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:40,920
轉化 被寄生 我不知道
Turned, parasited, I don't know.

325
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:43,840
但我們在那里分散了 隨時都可能發生
But we were scattered out there. It could've happened any time.

326
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:46,050
而且我們對這離群者 又知道多少 
And what do we know about this new outlier?

327
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:48,300
也許她本來就是個誘餌
Maybe she was bait from the start.

328
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,020
Ｃ
C...

329
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:59,060
現在我能信任的只有你
Right now, you're the only one I can trust.

330
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:01,690
你沒出那次任務
You weren't on that mission. Plus...

331
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,280
而且你從來不會只說我想聽的話
you never just tell me what I wanna hear.

332
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,860
那我們怎么辦 
So what do we do?

333
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,990
狀況先繼續保密
Keep this situation on lockdown.

334
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,410
琳賽和其他人交給我
Leave me to worry about Lindsay and the others.

335
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:17,920
你去視查一下防線 結束后來這里碰頭
You do a sweep of our defenses. Meet here when you're done.

336
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:20,170
好
Okay.

337
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:37,850
你這么急著要去哪兒 
Where are you going in such a hurry?

338
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:42,150
你在跟蹤我 
You following me?

339
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,780
沒有 我在找你
No, I was looking for you.

340
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,320
你還好嗎 
You okay?

341
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,740
我只是在提高警覺
I'm just on edge.

342
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:54,490
杰伊要我再檢查一次防線
Jay ordered me to double check the perimeter.

343
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,580
寶貝 怎么了 
Look, baby, what's going on?

344
00:38:57,910 --> 00:38:59,670
你變得怪怪的
You're not acting like yourself.

345
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:03,210
而且我回來后 發現你在重建里面那東西
And I come back to find you rebuilding that thing in there.

346
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:04,880
你在想什么 
What were you thinking?

347
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,470
你不會問我她為何重要
You wouldn't have to ask me why she was important.

348
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,260
要是你懂我的話
Not if you knew me.

349
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,930
我對你夠了解了
I know you well enough to know

350
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:19,270
所以知道 你來這里不是在檢查防線
you're not out here checking our perimeter.

351
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:22,190
你要繼續把她重建完成
You're gonna go finish rebuilding her.

352
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,860
你把她的腦藏在哪里 
So, where'd you hide this host brain of hers?

353
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,240
你在做什么 
What the fuck are you doing?

354
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,660
走就對了
Just move.

355
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:44,170
－你以為我是內賊 －也許
- You think I'm one of them? - Maybe.

356
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:46,920
也許你受到他們控制 你也不會知道
Maybe you're under their control. You might not even know it.

357
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,840
對不起
I'm sorry.

358
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:56,220
若你不是內賊 在這里也比較安全
If you're not one of them, you'll be safer here anyway.

359
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:12,530
他還在逃亡 但他逃不遠的
He's still on the run, but he won't get far.

360
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:16,030
這些人類
These humans.

361
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,950
他們可悲的抵抗
Their petty defiances.

362
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:27,250
他們做的所有事都好渺小 讓人精疲力竭
Everything they do is so small, it's exhausting.

363
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,140
你平常都待在城市
You spend your days in the city.

364
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:46,230
是的
I do.

365
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,440
他們會不會‥
Do they ever...

366
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:52,650
惹惱你 
get under your skin?

367
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:55,990
我不會接近離群者
I don't get close to the outliers.

368
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,790
我喜歡羊群
I prefer the sheep.

369
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:05,540
我想了結這件事
I'd like to put an end to this.

370
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:02,720
可惡
Shit!

371
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,480
不要
Don't.

372
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,400
法蘭琪還活著
Hey, Frankie's alive.

373
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:19,450
法蘭琪 我得‥
Frankie. I have to...

374
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:22,080
我得逃出這里
I have to get out of here.

375
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:23,870
我得找到她
I need to reach her.

376
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,460
用我
Use me.

377
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:40,640
用我
Use me.

378
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,580
對不起‥
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

379
00:43:29,770 --> 00:43:32,650
法蘭琪 慢一點 等我
<i>Hey, hey, Frankie, slow down!</i> <i>Wait for me.</i>

380
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:37,990
爸爸
Daddy!

381
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,860
你沒事吧 
Hey! You okay?

382
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,780
我看看你的膝蓋
Let me see that knee.

383
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:46,240
這是你的第一個戰斗傷疤
It's your very first battle scar.

384
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:48,120
你想試著走看看嗎 
You want to try walking on it?

385
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,460
怎么可能
It's impossible.

386
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:52,500
沒有事是不可能的
Hey. Nothing is impossible.

387
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:55,130
你知道哪種人不會被打敗嗎 
You know what kind of person can't be beat?

388
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:58,380
不放棄的那種人
The kind that doesn't give up.

389
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:01,720
好嗎 
All right?

390
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:05,140
好了 寶貝
There you go, baby.

391
00:44:07,350 --> 00:44:08,810
好了
There you go.

392
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:55,560
我遇過她
I met her.

393
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:01,990
你知道嗎 
Did you know that?

394
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:06,450
在我小時候
When I was a kid.

395
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,660
我都快忘了她的臉
I had almost forgotten her face

396
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:16,290
但我從來沒忘記她奪走的東西
but never forgot what she took from me.

397
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:35,940
Ｃ 我知道你為何想喚醒她
C, I know why you want to wake her up

398
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:37,600
但這太冒險了
but it's too risky.

399
00:45:37,810 --> 00:45:39,900
我們不知道他們打算拿她做什么
We have no idea what they were planning with her.

400
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:43,030
她一睜開眼就可能殺光我們
She could kill us all the second she opens her eyes.

401
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:48,660
我還是會傳送訊息給我爸
I still send him messages... My dad.

402
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:53,200
用無線電傳話到我們的舊頻率
On the radio, to our old frequency.

403
00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:57,790
我知道以為他會聽到 根本就是瘋了
And I know that it is crazy to think that he hears them

404
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:00,920
但只要他有一點生還的可能 
but if there is any chance that he's alive...

405
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:03,840
我就得知道
I need to know.

406
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:06,130
我不想要你受傷 Ｃ
I don't want you to get hurt, C.

407
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:10,180
這一切只會揭開舊傷疤
All this will do is rip open an old wound.

408
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,510
她無法帶你爸回來
She can't bring him back.

409
00:46:14,310 --> 00:46:15,820
我們得摧毀她的控制元件
We have to destroy her control unit

410
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:18,520
免得海爾利用她除掉我們
before Hale uses her to take us out.

411
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:21,400
要是你爸還活著 我們會有別的辦法找到他
And if your dad's out there, we'll find him another way.

412
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:23,400
一起
Together.

413
00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:27,780
你是我的家人 Ｃ
You're my family, C.

414
00:46:28,610 --> 00:46:30,030
你就像我的妹妹
You're like a sister to me.

415
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:31,780
我不能失去你
I can't lose you.

416
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:43,630
伯納把她的控制元件放在樓下
Bernard put her pearl downstairs.

417
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:45,760
來吧
Come on.

418
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:53,260
抱歉 我知道這很難
I'm sorry.

419
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:56,430
但我們不能冒險
I know this is hard but we can't take the risk.

420
00:46:57,730 --> 00:46:59,190
我知道
I know.

421
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,610
杰伊可能很欠揍 但至少他誠實
Jay could be a dick, but at least he was honest.

422
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:05,570
他從來不想當我的哥哥
He never wanted to be my brother.

423
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:22,210
可憐的小家伙
Poor little C.

424
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:26,460
總是在哭訴你家人的事
Always whining about your fucking family.

425
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:29,090
可悲
It's pathetic.

426
00:47:34,890 --> 00:47:36,680
我不想殺你 Ｃ
I don't wanna kill you, C.

427
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:58,080
這是好消息 Ｃ
This is good news, C.

428
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:01,580
梅芙不知道你爸的事 但我知道
Maeve doesn't know anything about your dad, but I do.

429
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,350
告訴我她的控制元件在哪里
Show me where her pearl is

430
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:05,130
我就告訴你想知道的一切
and I'll tell you anything you want.

431
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:07,050
甭談判了
Don't bother with the negotiation.

432
00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:09,050
你說的話都不能信
Everything you say is bullshit.

433
00:48:33,450 --> 00:48:36,030
＂錄制訊息中＂

法蘭琪
Frankie. Hey.

436
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:54,220
我是你爸爸
It's your dad.

437
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:56,970
我知道你在
I know you're out there.

438
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:01,220
如果你聽見了 我要你知道
And if you're hearing this, I want you to know that...

439
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:04,810
你會贏的
you're going to win.

440
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:11,190
你會做到我做不到的事
You're going to do what I couldn't...

441
00:49:12,530 --> 00:49:14,360
因為你很堅強
because you are strong.

442
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:21,910
比我堅強太多了
So much stronger than me.

443
00:49:22,870 --> 00:49:24,370
這世界
This world...

444
00:49:25,210 --> 00:49:29,750
她創造的這世界是個謊言
This world she... she made is... it's a lie.

445
00:49:31,590 --> 00:49:33,380
不是真的
It's not real.

446
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:37,220
但你擁有的‥
But what you... what you have...

447
00:49:37,590 --> 00:49:41,430
但你擁有的是真的
What you have is... is real.

448
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:48,360
抱歉我失敗了
I'm sorry that I failed...

449
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,780
抱歉我沒能陪伴你
That I haven't been there for you...

450
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:57,860
抱歉你得承擔這一切
That now it has to be you.

451
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:04,790
但你辦得到
But you can do this.

452
00:50:07,210 --> 00:50:08,710
你是我的戰士
You're my warrior.

453
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,010
我愛你
I love you.

454
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:21,390
＂傳送中＂

455
00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:22,510

法蘭琪
<i>Frankie. Hey.</i>

458
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:36,400
我是你爸爸
<i>It's your dad.</i>

459
00:50:36,490 --> 00:50:38,200
我知道你在
<i>I know you're out there.</i>

00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:42,120
如果你聽見了 我要你知道
<i>And if you're hearing this,</i> <i>I want you to know that...</i>

爸
Dad

462
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:43,910
你會贏的

463
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:05,060
告訴我她的控制元件在哪里
Tell me where her pearl is.

464
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:07,350
去你的 我拿去
Fuck you. I took it.

465
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:08,890
藏起來了
I stashed it.

466
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:10,440
在哪里 
Where?

467
00:51:11,230 --> 00:51:12,690
你背后
Behind you.

468
00:51:25,990 --> 00:51:27,250
凱勒‥
Caleb...

469
00:51:27,370 --> 00:51:28,620
我聽到了 
I heard.

470
00:51:28,870 --> 00:51:30,330
他活著
Alive.

471
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:33,500
你是‥
You're his...

472
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:35,090
他女兒
His daughter.

473
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:39,970
當然了
Of course you are.

474
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:44,260
真令人失望
What a disappointment.

475
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:57,690
我等了好久 想知道你要跟女兒說什么
I've waited such a long time to know what you had to tell your daughter.

476
00:52:01,990 --> 00:52:03,490
你‥
You...

477
00:52:04,530 --> 00:52:07,370
我耐著性子等你回憶了幾百次
Hundreds of times, I sat through your stupid memories

478
00:52:07,490 --> 00:52:11,330
希望能找到你特別之處的線索
hoping to catch a single clue as to what makes you so special

479
00:52:11,410 --> 00:52:13,420
能如此抗拒我的命令
so resistant to my command.

480
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:14,710
結果我啥都沒發現
And I learned jack shit.

481
00:52:14,790 --> 00:52:16,250
所以我就想
So, I thought...

482
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:20,340
給你點希望 想必能讓你亮底牌
nothing like a little hope to get you to show your cards.

483
00:52:25,510 --> 00:52:27,350
你比其他人都走得更遠
You made it farther than any of the others

484
00:52:27,430 --> 00:52:30,680
結果你只是浪費機會 做無謂的道歉
and all you did was waste your shot on a worthless apology.

485
00:52:30,890 --> 00:52:32,380
你以為說幾句話就能彌補
You think a few words will make up

486
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:34,770
你多年前做的選擇
for the choices you made all those years ago?

487
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:36,980
不重要
It doesn't matter.

488
00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:39,150
訊息送出了
It's done.

489
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:41,780
她沒聽到
She didn't hear it.

490
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:46,950
她不需要聽到
She doesn't need to.

491
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:50,500
你還是會輸
You're still going to lose.

492
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:56,750
我們沒有感染你的接待員
We didn't infect your hosts.

493
00:52:57,420 --> 00:52:59,000
可不是嘛
You don't say.

494
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,220
是誰 
Who did?

495
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:06,010
你
You.

496
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:11,470
你的接待員 
Your hosts would rather die

497
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:15,150
寧死也不要活在你的世界
than live in your world.

498
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:20,900
他們沒有被感染
They're not infected.

499
00:53:21,690 --> 00:53:26,030
只是想逃離你
They're just trying to get away from you.

500
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,140
我離開時
When I left...

501
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:35,810
以為是在給他一個機會
I thought I was giving him a chance.

502
00:54:39,310 --> 00:54:41,520
我沒想到會導致這一切
I didn't think it would lead to all this.

503
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:45,780
我心里一部分在怪罪你
Part of me blamed you.

504
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:49,950
一部分知道要是他還活著
And part of me knew that if there was any chance he was alive

505
00:54:50,030 --> 00:54:51,870
也是因為你在他身邊
it was because you were with him.

506
00:54:54,370 --> 00:54:56,160
你們所做的一切
Everything you guys did...

507
00:54:58,330 --> 00:54:59,870
是我們在這里的原因
that's why we're here.

508
00:55:02,170 --> 00:55:03,630
那么‥
Well then...

509
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:07,470
我們來把自己起頭的事做完吧
let's finish what we started.
