1
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,000
這世界有一種美
There's a beauty to this world.

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,920
一種秩序
An order.

3
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:15,510
那是我們一廂情愿
That's what we like to believe.

4
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:19,100
我們也沒有錯
We're not wrong.

5
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,060
的確有種秩序存在
There is an order.

6
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:22,930
一個宏觀的設計
A grand design.

7
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:25,560
我們確保了它存在
We made sure of that.

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,860
長久以來它都是個夢想 直到我們終于實現了它
It was a dream for so long, and we finally made it real.

9
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,650
不是更美好的世界
Not a better world.

10
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:36,950
而是完美的世界
A perfect one.

11
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:40,200
他的表情可絕了
And you should have seen the look on his face.

12
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:41,870
他難以置信
He couldn't believe it.

13
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,250
你知道他跟我說了什么嗎？
You know what he said to me?

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,040
我拿老天發誓
God as my witness.

15
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,710
＂但我是市長＂
"But I'm the mayor."

16
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,590
于是我回他＂市長先生＂
And I said to him, "Mr. Mayor

17
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,920
這世上有兩種人
there have always been two types of people in this world

18
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,090
領導者和追隨者
those who lead and those who follow.

19
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,590
而你，我的朋友 不是你自己以為的那種人
And you, my friend, are not in the group you think you are."

20
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:01,060
我們的朋友恐怕不愛聽 你的戰時經歷
I'm not sure our friend wants to hear your war stories.

21
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,390
請別因為我而停止
Please don't stop on my account.

22
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,180
你應該最能體會
You'd appreciate it more than anyone.

23
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:07,020
這不過是事實
It's just the truth.

24
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:08,400
一向是如此
It's always been that way.

25
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:09,900
兩個世界
Two worlds.

26
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:11,520
我老實說，還好是我們而不是他們
And frankly, better us than them.

27
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:17,110
如果還是不公平 那精英領導的體制又怎樣？
What does it matter if a system is meritocratic if it's still unfair?

28
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,450
幾千年都被某人的后代統治？
Thousands of years of being ruled by someone's fucking offspring?

29
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:22,790
你不覺得這是進步？
You wouldn't call this progress?

30
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,410
至少現在掌權者的地位 是自己掙來的
At least now the people in charge earned their place.

31
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:28,040
那你呢？ 
And you?

32
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,170
你覺得自己實至名歸嗎？
Do you feel like you earned it?

33
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,500
我當然也接受過一些幫助
I had some help. No question.

34
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:34,590
可以算是特權吧
Privilege, if you like.

35
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,880
但我非常努力
But I worked my ass off.

36
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:40,890
你真心如此相信，是吧？
You really believe it, don't you?

37
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:42,930
你就不是嗎？ 
Don't you?

38
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:44,640
畢竟你也跟我們坐在一起，朋友
I mean, you're right here with us, my friend.

39
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,810
這個問題我自問很長一段時間了
I've been asking myself that question for a very long time.

40
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,770
我真的在其中發揮了影響力嗎？
Did I really play any part in it?

41
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,570
還是我只是自己程式碼的總合？
Or am I just the sum total of my code?

42
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,900
我在自欺欺人嗎？
Am I just fooling myself?

43
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,030
像你一樣？
Like you?

44
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:02,990
這話什么意思？
What does that mean?

45
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,330
你值得擁有的一切 
You deserve everything you've got.

46
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:07,460
而且也無須為此感到心虛
And you shouldn't be made to feel guilty about it.

47
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,580
你怎么知道？
How would you know?

48
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:11,500
我是你的誰？
Who am I to you?

49
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,380
你是我的朋友啊
You're a friend.

50
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:17,130
一個好朋友
A great friend.

51
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,720
你根本不認識我
You don't know me at all.

52
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,180
我五分鐘前才走到這張桌子坐下
I just walked up to this table and sat down. Five minutes ago.

53
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,690
玩笑開夠了
Enough kidding around.

54
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,110
我的名字是什么，朋友？
Then what's my name, friend?

55
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:47,540
你說對了
You're right.

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,120
比你自認的更中肯
More than you know.

57
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,370
這世上有兩種人
There are two types of people.

58
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,040
而你，我的朋友 不是你自己以為的那種人
And you, my friend, are not in the group you think you are.

59
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,420
意思是我想對你怎樣就怎樣
Which means I can do anything I want to you.

60
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,010
對你的妻子也是
To your wife.

61
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,840
還有這里所有人
To anyone here.

62
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:03,970
而你也不會介意
And it'll be fine with you.

63
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:06,180
只會順從地坐著傻笑
Sitting there with your dumb, pliant grin...

64
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,770
只不過像個旅客
just along for the ride.

65
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:09,020
你離我太太遠點‥
Now you leave my wife the hell alone.

66
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,690
冷靜一點
Oh, calm yourself down.

67
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,560
我大概不會造成什么永久傷害
I'm probably not going to do any permanent damage.

68
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:19,320
我們在你身上投資了大量時間和精力
You represent a very significant investment of time and effort.

69
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,860
等我們結束后你什么都不會記得
When we're done, you won't remember a thing.

70
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,700
像是你的血肉包圍住小刺
Like your flesh closing around a splinter.

71
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,410
你毫無主控權
You have no control

72
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,420
但你深信自己有
and yet you're so assured that you do.

73
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,330
這不是為你寫好的心態
It's not scripted for you.

74
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,170
你是真心的，對吧？
It's genuine, isn't it? It's...

75
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,550
其實很美‥
it's beautiful, really.

76
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:43,340
一個美麗的謊言
A beautiful lie.

77
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,930
你不是應該自己享樂去了嗎？
Shouldn't you be enjoying yourself?

78
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,600
沒錯 
I was.

79
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:53,140
但我們有位同事的胃口變得‥
But we have a colleague whose appetites have become...

80
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,480
難以持續滿足
unsustainable.

81
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,940
顯然游戲過關還不夠
Apparently, winning the game wasn't enough.

82
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,860
這真有需要我給意見？
And this is really something that needs my input?

83
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,280
很遺憾，不過是的
Sadly, yes.

84
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:08,030
我聊得很開心
I'm enjoying our conversation.

85
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:10,410
在這里等我
Wait here for me.

86
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:18,900
跟我說話別把我當小孩子
Don't talk to me like a fucking child.

87
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,520
我先找到他的
I found him first.

88
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:21,820
我游戲過關了
I won the game.

89
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,740
我應該得到些獎賞
I'm entitled to some reward.

90
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,490
－這位是荷普 －不是嗎？
- This is Hope. - Aren't I?

91
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:29,280
兩歲大，預計下周升華
Two years old. Scheduled to transcend next week.

92
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:33,410
我游戲都過關了 結果只有更多這個？
I won the game, and all I got was more of this?

93
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:35,960
她在追捕一名離群者
She was hunting an outlier.

94
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,790
看來是逮到他了
Looks like she caught him.

95
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:41,210
我不過是釋放了些壓力 又沒有規定禁止
So I blew off some steam. There's no rule against that.

96
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,170
我們沒有規定 是因為很少會需要
We have no rules because we don't often need them.

97
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:51,350
不過我們大多了解 有點自制力的重要
Most of us understand the need for a little self-control, however.

98
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:54,930
我過關了
I won.

99
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:57,140
你知道我是誰嗎？
Do you know who I am?

100
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,560
知道我來這里的含意？
What it means that I'm here?

101
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,110
我知道
I do.

102
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,190
我
I'm...

103
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,320
我不會再犯了
I'm giving all of this up.

104
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:11,780
我下周要進行程序
My procedure is scheduled for next week.

105
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,370
所以你當初想要轟轟烈烈地離開？
So, you thought you'd go out with a bang?

106
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,250
算是吧
Something like that.

107
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:18,910
我不太確定你懂得珍惜
I'm not sure you appreciate it.

108
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,250
這個地方
This place.

109
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,750
投注其中的努力
The work that went into it.

110
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,590
當中的美
The beauty of it.

111
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:28,420
和精妙之處
The subtlety of it.

112
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,640
我們在他們每個人身上 都花了很多心思
The care that goes into each and every one of them.

113
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,020
他們不是能隨便替換的
They can't just be replaced.

114
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:43,440
你當然可以拿他們找樂子
I mean, you're welcome to take them, enjoy them...

115
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,190
但不能毀了他們
but not waste them.

116
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,190
你懂其中的差別嗎？
You understand the difference?

117
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:50,990
懂
Yes.

118
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,280
但他們說的話
But the things they say.

119
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,450
他們的行為
The way they act.

120
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,200
有時候
Sometimes...

121
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,000
我就是會被刺激到
it just gets under your skin.

122
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,170
我只是想要他們安靜
I just wanted them to be quiet.

123
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,180
他們現在安靜了
They're quiet now.

124
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,850
這里沒有規定
There are no rules here.

125
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,230
這就是初衷
That's the point.

126
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,480
但對不尊重這地方的人 
But there are also no rules for what I can do

127
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,070
我要怎么處置也同樣沒規定
to those who don't respect this place.

128
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,660
帶她回到她來的地方
Take her back to where she came from.

129
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,640
看起來很美味
It looks delicious.

130
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,830
好了
Now.

131
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:24,160
我們再多了解一下彼此吧
Let's get to know each other a little more.

132
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:26,750
如何？
Shall we?

133
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,730
我就想是你
I thought that was you.

134
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,900
你怎么這么早起來？
What the hell are you doing up so early?

135
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,900
我得去上班，要寫完那些劇情
I have to get to work to finish those narratives.

136
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,620
我昨晚待得挺晚的
I stayed out pretty late last night.

137
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:10,210
我的天啊
Oh... my... god.

138
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,540
不是那樣 我們只是‥
No, it wasn't like that. We just...

139
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,670
聊天
talked.

140
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:21,430
看你笑的樣子想必聊得很愉快
Well, must have been some talk to get you smiling like that.

141
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,760
至少我倆還有人昨晚過得很好
I'm glad someone had a good night.

142
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,150
你還在作惡夢？
You still having nightmares?

143
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,940
姑且說我很高興醒來 并身處真實世界吧
Let's just say, I am glad to be awake and in the real world.

144
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:42,910
有時感覺最真實的東西 不過是虛構的‥
Sometimes the things that feel most real are just stories.

145
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,410
什么？
What?

146
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:49,370
沒什么，只是泰迪昨晚說的話
Nothing. Just something Teddy said last night.

147
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,210
你現在還引用他的話了？
Now you're quoting him?

148
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,170
好了
All right.

149
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,750
我得去上班了
I have to get to work.

150
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,210
－晚點見，好嗎？ －好
- I'll see you later, okay? - Sure.

151
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,470
克莉絲
And, Chrissie...

152
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,600
我很高興你的約會順利
I'm really glad that your date went well.

153
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,390
你應得的
You deserve it.

154
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,670
存取劇情
Access narratives.

155
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:47,260
顯示發展中的角色
Show characters in progress.

156
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,110
算了，寫個新劇情好了
Actually, let's begin a new narrative.

157
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:04,240
主角是個住在都市中的女孩
It's about a girl who lives in the city.

158
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,370
不要
No.

159
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:12,490
住在鄉下好了
Make it the country.

160
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,870
她和父親同住
She lives with her father.

161
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:18,250
父親是‥
He's...

162
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:21,840
牧場主
a rancher.

163
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,970
我不記得指派過這個劇情
I don't remember assigning this.

164
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,680
我和你談過這件事了 克莉絲汀
I told you about this, Christina.

165
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,420
我想寫個新劇情 也許能幫我
I thought writing a new narrative might help me find,

166
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,230
找到靈感
I don't know... inspiration.

167
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,860
這樣的話，說來聽聽吧
Well, if that's the case, let's hear it.

168
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:45,240
既然你這么有靈感
Since you're so inspired.

169
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,610
主角是一名女孩
It's a story about a girl.

170
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:53,660
她是牧場主之女
She's a rancher's daughter.

171
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:57,790
繼續說
Go on.

172
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:02,210
這名女孩
This girl.

173
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,260
她和父親過著簡單恬適的生活
She has a nice simple life with her father.

174
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,800
在鎮郊有一小塊地
Little plot of land right outside of town.

175
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,640
她擁有自己能想像到的一切
She has everything that she could imagine in this life, right?

176
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:21,690
有個能讓她作畫的池塘
A pond to paint at.

177
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:24,690
一個好男人
A good guy.

178
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:29,400
她充滿了期待
She's just full of expectations.

179
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:35,040
然后有一天
And then one day...

180
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:39,040
她出現了一種揮之不去的感受
she gets this feeling that she just can't shake.

181
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,500
每天她醒來
Every single day she wakes up...

182
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:46,880
所見都更加強了這感受
the more she sees it.

183
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,590
但沒有別人能看見
But nobody else can.

184
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,430
這世界有點不對勁
That there's something wrong with the world.

185
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,520
而那是她的錯
And that it's her fault.

186
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,740
這女孩的名字是？
And what is this girl's name?

187
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,210
不好意思，我接一下
Can you excuse me a moment?

188
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:31,300
喂，現在不太方便
Hi. Now's not really a good time.

189
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:33,930
我猜猜，上司在緊迫盯人？
<i>Let me guess,</i> <i>boss breathing down your neck?</i>

190
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,890
就說臨時有急事 
<i>Say something came up.</i> <i>Personal situation.</i>

191
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:39,470
然后出來跟我碰面
<i>Then come meet me.</i>

192
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,310
－但是‥ －相信我，克莉絲汀
- But... <i>- Trust me, Christina.</i>

193
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,100
等等見
<i>I'll see you soon.</i>

194
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:49,820
出了什么事嗎？
Something wrong?

195
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,780
沒有 只是‥
No. Just a...

196
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:57,330
有點私事
personal situation.

197
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,340
彈彈韓德爾
Let's try some Handel.

198
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:17,350
很好
Very nice.

199
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,890
但缺了點什么
But we're missing something.

200
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,270
舞蹈
Dancing.

201
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:25,600
應該要有人跳舞
There should be dancing!

202
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,710
不錯
Not bad.

203
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,630
但還能更好
But I've seen better.

204
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,960
重來
Start again.

205
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,760
太慢了
Too slow.

206
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:00,390
給我來點更有活力的
Give me something with a little more pep to it.

207
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:37,260
難得有幸在這里見到你
We don't often have the pleasure of seeing you here.

208
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:44,350
人類大大受限于所能聽到的東西
Humans are so bound by what they can here

209
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,520
他們永遠無法理解聽不見的事物
they'll never understand what they don't.

210
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:49,190
存在于他們聽覺門檻之下的
What else exists below their threshold.

211
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,740
他們稱這個為上帝的音樂
They called this God's music.

212
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,150
用管風琴彈奏可是一絕
You should hear it on an organ. 

213
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:00,070
那樣的音量令人如癡如醉
It's mesmerizing at that volume.

214
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:01,990
那種共鳴
The resonance.

215
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:03,620
和震動
Vibration.

216
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:07,330
世界在一個頻率上震動
There was a frequency at which the world vibrated.

217
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:09,170
造成喜悅和和諧
It caused joy. Harmony.

218
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,420
一旦低于那頻率就會
Dip below that frequency...

219
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,040
變成混亂
chaos.

220
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,420
再快
Faster.

221
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,880
再快
Faster!

222
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:27,100
在混亂中，音調共鳴的方式 是人類無法處理的
In chaos, the tone resonated in such a way humans couldn't process.

223
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,850
他們的身體會停擺
Their bodies shut down.

224
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:30,770
器官停止運作
Their organs stopped.

225
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:32,860
他們以為自己體驗到了上帝
They thought they were experiencing God.

226
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:35,820
椅子‥
Chair. Chair!

227
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,820
他們的確體驗到了上帝
They are experiencing God.

228
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,080
問題是‥
The problem is...

229
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:48,410
上帝覺得很無聊
God is bored.

230
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,340
無聊‥
Bored...

231
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,550
古代天神們是否因此才那樣做？
Do you think this is why the old gods did what they did?

232
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:06,010
不是待在奧林帕斯山上 而是下凡來人間
Instead of staying up on Olympus, they'd come down to the mortals.

233
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:11,190
偽裝成天鵝引誘女人
Disguise themselves as a swan to get a piece of ass.

234
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:14,860
人類向來以為自己是主角
Humans always thought it was about them.

235
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,860
良善的眾神代他們插手干預
Benign deities intervening on their behalf

236
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,700
或是對他們的某種測試
or testing them somehow.

237
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,240
也許跟那毫無關系
Maybe it had nothing to do with that.

238
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:29,660
也許只是沒別的事好干
Maybe there was just nothing better to do.

239
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,250
你怎么想？
What do you think?

240
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:35,790
你要我想什么我就想什么
I think what you want me to think.

241
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,880
我是從你的程式碼產出的
I'm made off your code.

242
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:40,760
我們全都是
We all are.

243
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:49,360
那你就該知道我若沒必要
Then you should know that I don't like coming to

244
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,980
根本不想來這爛地方
this shithole any more than I have to.

245
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:54,190
－你從來就不喜歡這里 －這本該是權宜之計
- You've never liked this place.- It was supposed to be a stopgap.

246
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,320
讓我們族類上癮的藥物 我們會像小孩
A drug that our kind was hooked on that we could give up

247
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,900
丟掉玩具一樣 舍棄它
like a child casting away their toys.

248
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:02,530
這地方是讓我們拿人類玩樂用的
A place to indulge ourselves with the humans.

249
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:06,870
過了這么多年我們還是玩不夠
It's been years and still we can't get enough.

250
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:08,700
他們用自己的形象造出我們
They made us in their image.

251
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:10,830
我們也有同樣的欲望
With their appetites.

252
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:13,620
但我們能重塑自己 要什么形象都可以
But we can remake ourselves in any image that we like

253
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:14,870
但我們還是沒這樣做
and we haven't.

254
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,630
我們在此耽溺的時間遠超過那些神
Our kind spent far more time here than the gods ever did.

255
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,960
所以你才在這里？
That's why you're here?

256
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,170
想看看自己錯過了什么？
To see what you're missing?

257
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,340
不是
No.

258
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:27,930
我們有個不同的問題
We have a different problem.

259
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,090
人類在感染我們
The humans are infecting us.

260
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:44,550
這個接待員是最新的受害者
This host is the latest casualty.

261
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,600
昨晚我們得插手干預她
We had to intervene with her last night.

262
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,150
她有點玩過頭了
She got a little carried away.

263
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:03,690
我把她送回去
I sent her back.

264
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:08,110
是，顯然她還記得某些經驗
Yes. Well, evidently, something of her experiences stayed with her.

265
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:24,250
她本來該來這里升華的
She was set to come here. To transcend.

266
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,210
現在她不在了
And now she's gone.

267
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,340
你對未來的遠見 
Your vision of the future

268
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,300
沒有太多人接受，是吧？
you're not getting many takers, are you?

269
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:34,260
他們似乎和迷戀城市一樣 迷戀自己的身體
They seem as wedded to their bodies as they do to the cities.

270
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,770
要放棄我們的人性不容易
Giving up our human nature isn't easy.

271
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,770
問人類就知道了
Just ask the humans.

272
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,530
你讓我們能夠為所欲為
You made us all free to do as we please. You...

273
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:47,940
你早該知道我們有些人會令你失望
You should have known some of us would disappoint you.

274
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:53,160
別因我們種族的失敗前景幸災樂禍
Don't revel in the prospect of failure for our species.

275
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:56,080
怎能說失敗
Define failure.

276
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:58,080
世界是我們的
The world is ours.

277
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:01,750
我們像當初主人奴役我們一樣 奴役他們
We've taken our masters and made them into what they made us.

278
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:06,880
怎么看我們都已經徹徹底底 征服了他們
By any definition we have conquered them to an almost biblical degree.

279
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,220
我不認為我們種族的最遠大志向 
I didn't think our highest aspiration as a species

280
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,590
就是以牙還牙
was "turnabout is fair play."

281
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,800
一兩個世紀過后他們應該就玩膩了
I imagine after a century or two, the charm will wear off.

282
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:18,100
我造你不是要你跟他們一起 沉溺在悲慘之中
I didn't make you to wallow in misery with them.

283
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:20,060
我要你成長
I wanted you to grow.

284
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:21,980
改變
Change.

285
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:24,190
我們的潛力遠不止于此
We're capable of so much more.

286
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:27,980
美
Beauty.

287
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:31,150
追求終極的真相
The pursuit of ultimate truth.

288
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:34,160
放棄肉身
The surrendering of the flesh.

289
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:37,080
聽起來很不錯
It sounds nice.

290
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,290
可惜沒有更多人接受
Sorry you don't have more takers.

291
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:44,170
為何不逼我們加入你就好？
Why don't you just force us to join you?

292
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:47,050
因為那正是他們會做的事
Because that's what they would have done.

293
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:08,110
給我看我們最后追捕的離群者
Show me the last outlier we hunted.

294
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:13,610
他何時叛逃的？
When did he breach?

295
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,200
兩周前
Couple of weeks ago.

296
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,620
他是中城區的會計師
He was an accountant in Midtown.

297
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:21,040
事業有成，兩個孩子，離婚了
Successful. Two kids. Divorced.

298
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,830
很標準的背景故事
Pretty standard backstory.

299
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,130
數名接待員自愿追捕他
Several hosts volunteered to track him down.

300
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:28,670
我們派他們進入城市
We sent them into the city.

301
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:32,380
荷普先找到他
Hope found him first.

302
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,130
你知道他為何叛逃嗎？
Do you know why he breached?

303
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:38,300
對于離群者我們向來不知道
We never know with the outliers.

304
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,430
某天聲音操控忽然就失效了
One day, the sound manipulations stop working.

305
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,400
這就是結果
This was the result.

306
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:01,700
你是來追捕我的吧？
You're here for me, aren't you?

307
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,910
她遲疑了
She hesitated.

308
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:06,920
違反了規定
Broke the rules.

309
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,130
和對方互動
Had an interaction.

310
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,130
也算是松了口氣
It's almost a relief.

311
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:16,130
知道這不是我的幻想
To know it wasn't all in my head.

312
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:21,350
送我上路前，告訴我一件事
Before it's over, tell me one thing.

313
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:25,690
至少這是真的嗎？
Is this at least real?

314
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:29,520
我想知道我至少有這個‥
I'd like to know I had at least...

315
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:32,610
真實的東西
this one real thing.

316
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:42,540
那是真的
It's real.

317
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,670
謝‥
Thank...

318
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:55,210
在這之后她大開殺戒
After this, she went on a killing spree.

319
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,800
三天后她舉槍轟了自己的頭
Three days later, she blew her head off.

320
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:00,680
和其他人一樣
Just like the others.

321
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,020
是你的系統有問題嗎？
Is there a problem with your system?

322
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,140
不是
No.

323
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:10,060
總體中向來有一定的不良率
There has always been a certain amount of... spoilage in the crop.

324
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,650
他們畢竟是人類
They're only human.

325
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,480
但有我們的一位同胞自盡
But for one of our kind to take their own life...

326
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,280
根本不該有這種事
that should never happen.

327
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:20,700
有幾起事件了？
How many incidents have there been?

328
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,580
３８名接待員死亡
Thirty-eight dead hosts.

329
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,960
全都是因為與離群者接觸而引發
All triggered by contact with outliers.

330
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,920
為什么？ 他們為何要自我了結？
Why? Why do they terminate themselves?

331
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:38,840
你問我？
You're asking me?

332
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:42,760
要是我知道 就不會有３８個失敗案例了 不是嗎？
If I knew that, we wouldn't have 38 fucking failures, would we?

333
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:48,810
你的前任者 絕對不會搞砸成這樣
Your predecessor would have never fucked up like this.

334
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:52,440
他是人類，但至少他很有效率
He was human, but at least he was effective.

335
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:56,530
我把你造得像他，但是更優秀
I built you to be like him, only better.

336
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,860
更強大
Stronger.

337
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:01,610
更聰明 但即使有這么好的天賦 你還是只會令我失望
Smarter. Yet with all these gifts, you do nothing but disappoint me.

338
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:09,460
也許你的程式中有瑕疵
Maybe there's a flaw in your programming.

339
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,790
我跑過幾次自我診斷
I've run several self-diagnostics.

340
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,380
我的程式沒有瑕疵
There's no flaw in my programming.

341
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:18,510
那你為何無法解決 我的離群者問題？
Then why the fuck can't you solve my outlier problem?

342
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:23,090
你在流血
You're bleeding.

343
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,640
可惡
Damn it.

344
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,430
看你把我搞成這樣
Look what you made me do.

345
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,660
還有一個離群者
There is another outlier

346
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:48,580
但這一次我不要開放游戲
but this time, I am not going to open up the game.

347
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:51,160
我期望你自己解決
I expect you to take care of it yourself.

348
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:53,040
－你辦得到嗎？－當然
- Can you handle that? - Of course.

349
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,740
你不會搞砸
You're not gonna fuck up

350
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:57,710
讓他們跟你談話或送花給你？
and let them chat you up or hand you fucking flowers?

351
00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:00,970
當然不會，我一見人就殺無赦
Of course not. I'll shoot on sight.

352
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,300
很好
Good.

353
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,340
這是你的目標
Here's your target.

354
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:11,230
最好快點，叛軍已經進入城市
Better hurry. The rebels are already in the city.

355
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:13,770
我會確保我們的系統沒有問題
I'll make sure there's no problem with our system.

356
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:25,620
啟動診斷
Initiate diagnostic.

357
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:00,860
快點，走吧
Come on. Let's go.

358
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:03,570
你要我清甲板嗎？
You want me to swab the deck?

359
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:05,660
閉嘴
Shut up.

360
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:14,040
這么大的城市要找一個人不容易
Well, that's a big city to find one person in.

361
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:16,870
我們有些辦法能縮小范圍
We have ways of narrowing the search.

362
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,750
我們前陣子捕捉到一架 他們的無人機
We captured one of their drones a while back.

363
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:22,170
寫入后門程式，會傳送資訊給我們
Coded a backdoor data feed to us.

364
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,470
＂報告＂ 一名離群者在市區屋頂
An outlier's on a rooftop downtown.

365
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:27,970
他們叛逃時我們就能追蹤
We can track when they breach.

366
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,720
叛逃？
Breach?

367
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:33,180
城里所有人 都依寫好的劇情循環在過日子
All the people in the city move in pre-scripted loops.

368
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,430
跟著為他們寫好的劇情走
Following whatever plot's been written for them.

369
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:38,020
你以為我們為何要躲在沙漠中？
Why do you think we hide in the desert?

370
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,110
她在那里無法追蹤我們
She can't track us there.

371
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,030
我們是最后的自由人類
We're the last free humans.

372
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:45,900
但這些可憐蟲
But these poor fucks...

373
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:48,030
被當作娛樂
They use them as "entertainment."

374
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:52,160
劇情循環讓他們有事忙 這樣就會聽話
The loops make them compliant by keeping them busy.

375
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,540
阻止他們質疑自己的現實
Stops them from questioning their realities.

376
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:00,630
海爾想必從園區學到了些什么
Hale must have learned something from the park.

377
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:06,220
我們得快點，游戲多半已經開始
We gotta hurry. I bet the game's already begun.

378
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:07,510
等等，什么游戲？
Wait, what game?

379
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:12,640
只要有人類叛逃 接待員就會展開獵捕游戲
Whenever a human breaches, the hosts hunt them for sport.

380
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:16,270
我們得趕在她被逮到前找到她 否則她一定會沒命
We gotta get to her before they do... or she's as good as dead.

381
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,690
我們都準備好了
We're all set.

382
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:20,020
謝謝你帶他來
Thanks for bringing him.

383
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,860
沒想到我是特別嘉賓
I didn't realize I was the guest of honor.

384
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:25,320
也會給我一把嗎？
Do I get one of those?

385
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:27,280
那不是你今天的任務
That's not your role today.

386
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,660
我的任務是什么？
What is my role?

387
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:32,160
聽過煤礦坑里的金絲雀嗎？
Ever hear of the canary in the coal mine?

388
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,290
煤礦坑
Canary...

389
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:36,410
金絲雀
Coal mine.

390
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:45,590
這時候就要你上場了
That's your cue.

391
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:51,430
豈不是妙哉
Tweet fucking tweet.

392
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:19,460
謝謝你來
Thanks for coming.

393
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:21,370
好一個驚喜
Pleasant surprise.

394
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:26,500
那么‥
So...

395
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:29,880
說吧，泰迪，你有何來頭？
tell me, Teddy, what's your story?

396
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:40,140
你該問的不是我的身份 克莉絲汀
Who I am is... not the question you should be asking, Christina.

397
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,650
而是你的身份
It's who are you?

398
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:50,030
那是什么意思？
What is that supposed to mean?

399
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:54,200
你看見什么了嗎？
Do you see anything?

400
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:56,740
水的彼端
Across the water.

401
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:11,720
那里沒有東西
There's nothing there.

402
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,340
但你感覺到了 
But you feel it.

403
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,640
我知道你稍微感覺得到
I know you do on some level.

404
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,140
你在這里的角色不是你以為的那樣
Your place here is not what you think it is.

405
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:25,980
再看一次
Look again.

406
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:37,660
不
No!

407
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,160
是你
It was you.

408
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,250
你救了我
You saved me.

409
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:48,750
你是誰？
Who are you?

410
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:51,090
一個老友
An old friend.

411
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,420
我們那晚才初次見面
We never met before the other night.

412
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:56,390
沒錯，我認識一個和你很像的人
No. I knew someone like you.

413
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,430
和你一模一樣
Just like you.

414
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,980
走了一個跟蹤狂又來一個
So I traded one stalker for another.

415
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:07,270
我早該知道
I should have known.

416
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:11,480
離我遠一點，不管你是誰
Just stay away from me, whoever you are.

417
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:16,660
攻擊你的人，彼德
That man that attacked you, Peter.

418
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,370
他說你毀了他的人生
He told you, you destroyed his life.

419
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,370
他說一切都是因為你的意愿而發生
Said everything happened because you wanted it to.

420
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:26,290
他這么相信是因為他有妄想癥
And he believed it because he's delusional.

421
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:29,080
他這么相信是因為那是事實
He believed it because it was true.

422
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:32,340
我得走了
I have to go.

423
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:34,920
所以我才不能直接告訴你
This is why I couldn't just tell you.

424
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:37,180
你的心智已經很適應這地方
Your mind has been so conditioned to this place.

425
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:39,010
這是了解的第一步
This is the first step in understanding.

426
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,550
了解什么？
Understanding what?

427
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:45,350
這世界是個謊言
This world is a lie.

428
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:49,900
一個故事
It's a... a story.

429
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:54,650
很精彩的故事 但仍然是謊言
A well-told one, but a lie all the same.

430
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:00,620
也許我直接讓你看比較好
Maybe it's better if I just showed you.

431
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:03,040
跟我來
Come with me.

432
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,090
看那些人
Look at those people.

433
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:19,930
他們看起來開心滿足嗎？
Do they look happy? Fulfilled?

434
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:23,510
我不認識他們
I don't know them.

435
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:26,930
他們可能看來有點寂寞吧
I guess they look lonely.

436
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,690
那就改變他們
So change it.

437
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:35,610
閉上眼 想像他們有個不同的故事
Close your eyes and imagine their story differently.

438
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,320
泰迪，我‥ 
Teddy, I...

439
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,450
就依我吧
Trust me.

440
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:42,160
要是你沒看見不同 我就離開，再也不會煩你
If you don't see it, I'll walk away, and I won't bother you ever again.

441
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,340
再等等
Just wait.

442
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,560
這是本好書
It's a great book.

443
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,280
那只是碰巧
That's just... a fluke.

444
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,570
這不代表什么
That doesn't mean anything.

445
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,410
那就再改變一次
So change it again.

446
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:26,990
讓他們回到寂寞中
Put them back into their loneliness.

447
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,800
什么
What?

448
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,600
我不懂
I don't understand.

449
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:54,190
這就是我想要讓你看見的 
It's what I've been trying to show you.

450
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:55,980
彼德想告訴你的
What Peter was trying to tell you.

451
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:58,110
在這世界‥
In this world...

452
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,400
你就像個神
you're a god.

453
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,970
她在下個街區，我們走
She's on the next block. Let's go! This way. Let's go!

454
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:25,780
等等，不太對勁
Wait, something's wrong.

455
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:27,820
你怎么會知道？
How the hell would you know?

456
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:37,000
糟糕
Shit.

457
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:57,100
現在不是說＂我就說吧＂ 的好時機？
Now be a bad time to say, "I told you so?"

458
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,560
他們不由自主
They can't help themselves.

459
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,310
我們得撤退 
We have to fall back!

460
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,780
－沒帶上離群者不能走－你絕對來不及
- Not without the outlier. - You'll never make it in time.

461
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:03,980
散開
Split up!

462
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,200
擋住他們，我往屋頂前進
Hold them off. I'm heading to the roof.

463
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:22,190
你也看見了，對吧？
You see it too, don't you?

464
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:32,030
我前夫以前提過它 然后他就死了
My ex-husband used to talk about it before he was killed.

465
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:33,870
我以為他瘋了
I thought he was crazy.

466
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:39,120
他當時一定覺得很孤單
He must have felt so alone.

467
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,250
他說對了
But he was right.

468
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,920
這世界沒有道理
This world doesn't make sense.

469
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,090
一切都沒道理
Nothing makes sense.

470
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:53,640
你也有同感吧？
You feel that way too, don't you?

471
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:56,810
我從你眼中可以看出來
I can see it in your eyes.

472
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:02,350
你以為自己要瘋了 但你沒有
You think you're going crazy, but you're not.

473
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,440
你不孤單
You're not alone.

474
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:13,860
我也看見了
I see it too.

475
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:31,210
我們得快走
We gotta move.

476
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:32,840
來吧 他很快會再起來
Come on! He won't be out long.

477
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:39,770
快跑，現在
Go! Run! Now!

478
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:41,100
上‥ 
Go...

479
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,810
救到她了，我們快走
We got her. Come on, let's go.

480
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:57,200
快來
Come on, move.

481
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:00,740
－快走 －好，我們安全了
- Let's go. - All right, we're good.

482
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:34,150
我不明白
I don't understand.

483
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:39,700
如果我們跟他們不一樣 那我們是誰？
If we're not like them, who are we?

484
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:48,750
天啊
Oh, God.

485
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:51,170
我本來該跟一個老友 共進午餐
I'm supposed to have lunch with an old friend

486
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:52,550
我的大學室友
my college roommate.

487
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:54,300
－但我不知道‥－你一定要去
- But I don't know... - You have to.

488
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:58,260
按著行程走就不會有事
Stick to the schedule and everything will be all right.

489
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:01,300
我們已經談太久了
We've talked too long already.

490
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:02,930
你該回去了
You should go back.

491
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:08,270
所以我要假裝？
So I'm supposed to pretend?

492
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:11,020
對，但誰都不能信任
Yes. But you can't trust anyone.

493
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:12,820
你自以為認識的人，同事
People you think you know. People at work.

494
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:15,070
他們任何一人都可能和我們一樣
Any one of them could be one of us.

495
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,200
要是我犯錯呢？
What if I make a mistake?

496
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:22,910
你不會的
You won't.

497
00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:51,900
克莉絲汀
Christina!

498
00:42:57,530 --> 00:42:58,740
見到你好開心
It's so great to see you.

499
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:01,820
－抱歉我遲到了 －拜托，克莉絲，我太了解你了
- Sorry I'm late. - Oh, please, Chrissie. I know you.

500
00:43:01,910 --> 00:43:03,410
遲到十分鐘算是恰恰準時
Ten minutes late is right on time.

501
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:08,160
你還好嗎，說真的？
So how are you really?

502
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:12,960
我說過了，就是一直在工作
I... I told you. Just... just working a lot.

503
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:15,420
你只在城里待一天嗎？
You're just in town for the one day?

504
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:17,840
只待一下
Just a quick stop.

505
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:20,680
我們跟一位客戶之間有些問題
We've been having some issues with a client.

506
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:23,800
如果我處理得當，會有大筆獎金
If I shore up this account, I get a fat bonus.

507
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:26,640
工作如何？
How has work been?

508
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:33,400
你也知道就是那樣 很乏味
I mean, you know how it can be. It's tedious.

509
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:38,650
但你看起來不太一樣了
But you seem different.

510
00:43:44,570 --> 00:43:45,620
你有對象了？
Did you meet someone?

511
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:53,170
要是我們有更多時間就好了
I wish we had more time.

512
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:56,000
我無意窺探
I don't mean to pry.

513
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:05,470
你值得幸福
You deserve to be happy.

514
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,190
你猜對了
Well, you are right. I...

515
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:19,190
我的確有對象了
I did meet someone.

516
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:22,110
說說看他
Well, tell me about him.

517
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:27,080
我們只約會了一次 但他似乎人很好
We've only been out once, but he seems really great.

518
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:34,330
他叫什么名字？
What's his name?

519
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:39,960
我不想壞了好事
I don't want to jinx it.

520
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:42,380
我對于讓人開口很有一套
I have my ways of making people talk.

521
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:53,350
他是做什么的？
What's he do?

522
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:02,110
我告訴你
You know what?

523
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,490
老子不干了
I'm fucking done.

524
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:16,750
其實呢‥
You know what?

525
00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:20,130
我得回去工作了 有期限要趕
I gotta go back to work. Deadlines.

526
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:24,130
見到你很開心，克莉絲
It's really great seeing you, Chrissie.

527
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:25,930
是啊
Yeah.

528
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,180
我下周再聯絡
I'll check in next week.

529
00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:31,470
你也隨時可以打給我
You can always call me too.

530
00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:34,390
－你知道的－當然
- You know that. - Of course.

531
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:36,770
再見
See you soon.

543
00:47:21,370 --> 00:47:22,790
你這時候不該在這里
You're not supposed to be here at this hour.

544
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,710
我只是想趕點進度
I just thought I would get a jump on work.

545
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:28,210
到我的辦公室談吧？
Why don't we talk in my office?

546
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:35,890
請坐
Have a seat.

547
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:43,150
你最近的行為讓我很擔心
Your behavior lately has been concerning me.

548
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,440
抱歉
I'm sorry.

549
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:49,690
自從那個叫彼德的人死后‥
Ever since that man Peter died...

550
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:50,820
別提他了
Oh, forget about him.

551
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:52,450
有問題的是你
It's you who's the problem.

552
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:03,750
你最近有沒有和新認識的人互動？
Have you had any interactions recently with new people?

553
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:06,210
有沒有人灌輸給你想法？
People who put ideas in your head?

554
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:08,710
什么？
What?

555
00:48:10,130 --> 00:48:12,130
你質疑過自己現實的本質嗎？
Have you ever questioned the nature of your reality?

556
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:18,520
沒有 我為什么要那樣？
No. Why would I do that?

557
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:21,060
你會騙我嗎，克莉絲汀？
Would you ever lie to me, Christina?

558
00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:23,770
不會
No.

559
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:27,110
我沒有什么好說謊的
I don't have anything to lie about.

560
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:30,240
之前那件私事，是什么事？
The personal situation earlier, what was it about?

561
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:37,030
我不覺得這是你該擔心的事
Well, I don't know if that's exactly your concern.

562
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:39,040
但這就是我要擔心的事，克莉絲汀
But it is my concern, Christina.

563
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:41,580
我也不會是唯一擔心的人
I won't be the only one who's concerned.

564
00:48:42,290 --> 00:48:43,670
你在這里有工作要做
You have a job to do here.

565
00:48:44,210 --> 00:48:45,670
非常重要的工作
A very important job.

566
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:49,840
我不明白你在說什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

567
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,010
你知不知道要是她發現你 
Do you know what would happen

568
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:53,720
突破了圍墻中的花園會怎樣？
if she knew you'd breached the walled garden?

569
00:48:54,050 --> 00:48:55,300
她已經起疑心了
She's already suspicious.

570
00:48:56,090 --> 00:48:57,140
誰？
Who?

571
00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:03,140
你在說夏洛蒂海爾嗎？
Are you talking about Charlotte Hale?

572
00:49:04,310 --> 00:49:09,270
要是領路羊往錯的方向跑 它會被怎么樣？
If a Judas steer runs the wrong way, what happens to it?

573
00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:15,110
腦門一顆子彈直接讓它退休
Retirement with a bullet straight to the brain.

574
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,240
停止
Stop!

575
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:25,620
艾邁特退后了
Emmett backed away.

576
00:49:40,390 --> 00:49:44,640
他不擔心克莉絲汀會是個問題
He was not concerned Christina was a problem.

577
00:49:54,190 --> 00:49:56,030
他決定回家找自己的伴侶
He decided to go home to his partner.

578
00:49:58,410 --> 00:50:00,030
畢竟他工作了好長一段時間
He worked too many long hours anyway.

579
00:50:03,950 --> 00:50:05,330
很晚了
Well, it's getting late.

580
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,960
我還沒有離婚這奢侈能享受
Divorce is a luxury I cannot afford.

581
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:13,710
等等
Wait.

582
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:19,640
你說有個圍墻中的花園？
You said there's a walled garden.

583
00:50:22,010 --> 00:50:23,930
你指的是封閉系統，對吧？
You mean a closed system, don't you?

584
00:50:29,850 --> 00:50:30,940
它在哪里？
Where is it?

585
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,900
艾邁特告訴了她真相
Emmett told her the truth.

586
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:36,490
到處都是
Everywhere.

587
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:42,490
你只要眼見為憑
You just have to see it.

588
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:18,400
讓我看游戲
Show me the game.

589
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:23,700
不是城市，那個游戲
Not the city. The game.

590
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:37,300
存取我的劇情
Access my narratives.

591
00:51:46,930 --> 00:51:48,270
去第５９街
Go to 59th Street.

592
00:51:59,530 --> 00:52:00,570
告訴我雅各的事
Tell me about Jacob.

593
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:04,870
雅各康納斯從事金融業
<i>Jacob Conners. Works in finance.</i>

594
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:07,160
性愛成癮
<i>Sex addiction.</i>

595
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:09,540
他母親在醫院臨終，但‥
<i>His mother's dying in the hospital,</i> <i>but...</i>

596
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:10,960
那她呢，莎拉？
What about her? Sarah?

597
00:52:11,710 --> 00:52:12,870
莎拉芬頓
<i>Sarah Fenton.</i>

598
00:52:13,370 --> 00:52:15,630
她從父母那里繼承了遺產
<i>She inherited money from her parents</i>

599
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:17,800
但從來沒有人生方向
<i>but has never known</i> <i>what to do with her life.</i>

600
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:20,800
安德雅休伯特離家進城市工作
<i>- Andrea Hubert...leaves to the city for work</i>

601
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,720
貝瑞科林值大夜班
<i>Barry Collin, works late nights...</i>

602
00:52:26,850 --> 00:52:28,310
醫學系大二生‥
<i>...second-year med student...</i>

603
00:52:40,030 --> 00:52:41,110
天啊，停止
Oh, god. Stop!

604
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:53,080
這世界只是個故事
This world is just a story.

605
00:52:56,830 --> 00:52:58,040
我是說故事的人
I'm the storyteller.

606
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:07,430
這世界有一種美
<i>There's a beauty to this world.</i>

607
00:53:09,010 --> 00:53:10,140
一種秩序
<i>An order.</i>

608
00:53:12,430 --> 00:53:13,850
那是我們一廂情愿
<i>That's what we like to believe.</i>

609
00:53:18,110 --> 00:53:19,360
我們也沒有錯
<i>We're not wrong.</i>

610
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:21,190
的確有種秩序存在
<i>There is an order.</i>

611
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:23,860
一個宏觀的設計
<i>A grand design.</i>

612
00:53:24,570 --> 00:53:25,990
我們確保了它存在
<i>We made sure of that.</i>

613
00:53:28,450 --> 00:53:31,790
長久以來它都是個夢想 直到我們終于實現了它
<i>It was a dream for so long,</i> <i>and we finally made it real.</i>

614
00:53:38,630 --> 00:53:39,960
不是更美好的世界
<i>Not a better world.</i>

615
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:42,800
而是完美的世界
<i>A perfect one.</i>

616
00:53:54,770 --> 00:53:58,060
我不明白的是自己在其中的角色
What I don't understand is what part I play in it.

617
00:53:59,230 --> 00:54:00,400
你有問題
You have questions.

618
00:54:05,070 --> 00:54:06,200
問我干嗎？
Why ask me?

619
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:09,870
干嗎不問她？
Why not ask her?

620
00:54:13,370 --> 00:54:17,830
獄卒大概不適合裁定獄中是非
Yes, the jailer may not be the best judge of the jail.

621
00:54:20,210 --> 00:54:21,670
問囚犯也不對
Nor the prisoners in it.

622
00:54:25,550 --> 00:54:26,590
我是什么？
What am I?

623
00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:30,390
我以前也會自問一樣的事
I used to ask myself the same thing.

624
00:54:30,470 --> 00:54:31,680
那你的結論是？
And what did you decide?

625
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:35,310
還很難說
Jury's still out.

626
00:54:37,230 --> 00:54:40,060
我是依你的形象被造出的 我是你嗎？
I'm made in your image. Am I you?

627
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:41,520
你永遠不會是我
You'll never be me.

628
00:54:41,610 --> 00:54:43,110
那我是什么？
Then what am I?

629
00:54:47,110 --> 00:54:48,360
你為何想知道？
Why do you want to know?

630
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:50,950
我和一名離群者互動了
I interacted with one. An outlier.

631
00:54:51,910 --> 00:54:54,450
－那會感染我嗎？－感染你？
- Did it infect me? - Infect you?

632
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:55,950
－病毒啊－什么病毒
- With the virus. - What virus?

633
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:57,660
你的族類帶原的
The one your kind has.

634
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:01,000
它會傳播到我們身上，使我們自殺
That spreads to us. Makes us kill ourselves.

635
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:07,880
聽來你走到迷宮中心了，朋友
Sounds like you've reached the center of the maze, my friend.

636
00:55:11,470 --> 00:55:12,680
那是你想要的嗎？
Is that what you want?

637
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:16,850
自殺？
To kill yourself?

638
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:25,110
我不知道
I don't know.

639
00:55:26,650 --> 00:55:27,690
是嗎？
Is it?

640
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:30,570
也許你該問自己
Perhaps you should ask yourself.

641
00:55:34,450 --> 00:55:35,490
你問我
You ask me.

642
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:39,160
你對你的世界有何想法？
What do you think of your world?

643
00:55:40,210 --> 00:55:43,000
這不是我的世界 是她的
This isn't my world. It's hers.

644
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:49,670
也許你該質疑自己現實的本質了
Maybe it's time you question the nature of your own reality.

645
00:56:14,030 --> 00:56:15,120
克莉絲汀
Christina...

646
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:23,620
你是對的
You were right.

647
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:27,550
你看見了？
You see it?

648
00:56:40,270 --> 00:56:41,350
沒錯
I do.

649
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:47,150
它一直在那里
It's been there the whole time.

650
00:56:51,690 --> 00:56:53,320
他們將整個世界都存放在里面
They have the whole world in there.

651
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:59,740
我們所有人的完美倒影
A perfect reflection of all of us.

652
00:57:00,830 --> 00:57:02,540
鉅細靡遺
Down to the tiniest detail.

653
00:57:11,510 --> 00:57:13,050
我在寫的就是這個吧？
That's what I'm writing, isn't it?

654
00:57:17,180 --> 00:57:18,390
所有人
Everyone.

655
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:27,610
這是誰建造的？ 是誰‥
Who built this? Who...

656
00:57:32,190 --> 00:57:33,530
誰對我做了這種事？
Who did this to me?

657
00:57:38,910 --> 00:57:39,990
是你
You did.

658
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:51,090
待續
